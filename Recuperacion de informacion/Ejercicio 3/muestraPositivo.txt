('I don\'t really know where to start or what I expect to gain from posting this I saw a post on this subreddit while flipping through random stuff while I was sitting on the can and I just felt like posting this is something I wanted to do but I have no idea why Maybe I hope it will help idkI feel like a dickhead as I try to type some of this stuff so bear with me if this starts to sound like I\'m just jerking myself off over how great I am or something because it\'ll hopefully make sense once I get into itIf I had to do a TL;DR I\'m between 35 and 40 I\'ve done pretty well at everything that there is to do well at as a man other than have kids which I\'m not interested in but I don\'t feel pretty much anything positive about it I can\'t talk to anyone I know about this because I\'m too afraid it\'ll just come across as me being an ungrateful jackass which is what I feel like most days anyway I apologize in advance if this is super longI don\'t know where to start so I\'ll just start with my relationships I\'m pretty great with women I wasn\'t always this way especially when I was in my late teens/early 20s but I put the work in and figured it out When I\'m single I have no problem pulling attractive girls online or in person I have a longterm girlfriend of 5+ years in her mid20s who could basically be one of these super hot thickfit "Instagram models" if she wanted She\'s super smart graduated with a 40 is legitimately one of the hardestworking people I\'ve ever met and she\'s so goddamn sweet and awesome with kids that it\'s just ridiculous She has a fulltime job and has built a mediarelated business that does well also with clients from all over the USI have another longterm girlfriend of 7+ years in her late 20s who is pretty great too We also celebrated our seventh anniversary earlier this week of being together or whatever She\'s pretty as fuck and she\'s so smart it\'s ridiculous She was the first person I ever met in my life that I could spend any amoount of time around and never get bored and it\'s still like that today She\'s one of those people that when she decides to start working at something that it\'s pretty much a foregone conclusion that she\'s going to be successful at itThey live with me and they\'re really into each other Despite having been together for years our sex lives are still going strong and I can\'t remember the last time either of them turned me down for sex They\'re both super into me to the point of feeling selfconscious about it and to make that even more fucked up they\'re both turned on by me fucking other women Like what the fuck could I possibly have to complain aboutI\'m coming back to put this in after the fact but I thought it might be notable that one of the only things that consistently makes me feel good at all is if I do something for them I\'m invested in wanting them to be successful and happyI feel like a total jackass because I just don\'t care When one of them comes to tell me about something exciting they\'re working on or whatever I just want them to go away It\'s not about what they\'re saying or that they\'re excited because I\'m glad for them that they are so happy but it\'s just the actual act of them talking to me it could be anyone talking to me that fucks with me and makes me incredibly anxious On top of that I\'m super indifferent to all of it and that adds a shitload of guilt on top of it all I feel like I\'m supposed to feel amazing having these two amazing people in my life and I just don\'t feel anything but anxious and annoyedI guess I should clarify that I don\'t feel any of this because of jealousy or insecurity or anything like that I feel the same about pretty much everything but I\'m also successful myself In the spirit of being vague enough to maintain my privacy while being specific enough to give anyone reading this an idea I have a content production and consulting business I\'ve built over the past 1012 years that does well Before that I played poker professionally for 56 years after quitting college at the beginning of my senior year applied mathematics after becoming disillusioned with academia I\'d been putting myself through school largely from some websites I had built that were bringing in some moneyOne issue I do have is that I\'m in a position now where I can make decent money without having to work much which is lucky and/or a good thing since I can\'t get motivated to work much at all I\'m talking less than 10 hours a week I feel a tremendous amount of guilt about this as well because if I put in more time and effort I could easily be making a shitload of money The stupid part about it is that I also feel guilt about feeling guilty along the lines of it should be a good thing that I can do as well as I do without having to work much which is something a lot of people wish they could haveI\'ve had success in several different areas at several different things and I feel nothing about it I feel guilty because it\'s like I should at least feel proud about it but I just don\'t care It\'s like there\'s something broken in me where I don\'t feel good about things that it would logically make sense for me to feel good aboutI\'ve done a lot to try to fix this or at least to make something change in me to where I feel something about it other than guilt and annoyance I go for a run about twice a week and lift about twice a week Sometimes it\'s once sometimes it\'s thrice just depending on the weather and what else I\'ve got going on but I do that and do a fair amount of yard work and stuff around the house so I\'m pretty activeI\'ve worked to eat better for a while now My breakfasts usually consist of sausage eggs and a piece of toast though I skip breakfast a lot since I\'m often not hungry in the mornings The rest of my meals are largely centered around steak or chicken in various forms and I do a lot of cooking I try to be reasonable about not just piling the rest of my plate with carbs since I have a thing about most green vegetables triggering my gag reflex I\'ll explain that one below in case someone wonders wtf I\'m talking about I eat a fair amount of beans as a side; I cook them myself and don\'t really do the canned beans thing etc I drink more caffeine than I probably should but I\'ve had multiple periods of 612 months where I drank no caffeine at all without any reliefOn the green vegetables thing when I was like eight years old or so my mom once forced me to eat these gross canned carrots that I hated that weren\'t really cooked well her version of cooking was pouring something from a can into a bowl putting it in the microwave stirring it and putting it on the kitchen table Anyway I was crying my eyes out and just tried to force myself to eat it since she wouldn\'t let me get up from the table or whatever if I didn\'t and I ended up throwing up like on my plate on the table on the floor and whatever and then she made me eat the carrots I\'d thrown up until she eventually just gave up from my crying and shit and told me I could get up and go do whatever after I cleaned up the messI feel kind of bad for bringing that up From a rational standpoint I know it was fucked up and I know my mom was a massive piece of shit for that and a lot of other reasons and my dad for enablng her but I don\'t really feel anything about it It\'s just whatever for meBack on the topic of things I\'ve tried to fix this shit I finally went to a therapist when I was like 28 or 29 I hated going for a lot of the same reasons why I\'m hating writing this out because I feel selfconscious and guilty talking about the interplay between the things in my life that should make me feel great and the reality that I just feel nothing for them and feel awful all the timeHis opinion was complex PTSD or CPTSD My understanding of it is that my childhood abuse sexual physical emotional and other brands of fuckedup bullshit basically fucked up my nervous system so that I\'m constantly acting as if I\'m under threat on a physiological level I\'ve done a tremendous amount of work on this to little or no avail and it\'s actually the reason why I started being more active with running and lifting and shit like that because it helps some people diagnosed with CPTSD quite a bit It hasn\'t done much for me that I can tell and I don\'t really like running and lifting or pretty much anything tbh but it\'s just habit at this point and something to doI\'ve meditated regularly since my early 20s and I still do it regularly now I hate to know how much worse things would be if I hadn\'tI\'ve done a whole lot of reading on the topic and I\'ve read pretty much everything there is to read on it What I\'ve read from Bessel van der Kolk Peter Levine and others has been very helpful in terms of conceptualizing what the issues are where they come from and why they work the way they do but it\'s not been very helpful in terms of reliefI stopped the going to therapy thing after a while because it just started to seem like Groundhog Day without any progress and I was paying out of pocket so it just seemed like a waste of money The things we talked about were helpful in conceptualizing what was going on and why much like the bulk of material I\'ve read on the subject but there wasn\'t really anything happening to help give me reliefIt\'s worth noting that from my understanding of the material anyway that relief is a relative term for this and that getting to the point of tolerating and managing symptoms is about the best one can hope for It\'s not exactly something that inspires a lot of confidence but I\'m kind of stubborn about trying to figure this shit outI\'ve been vaguely suicidal since my late teens and have thought about it at least a couple of times a week for the past 1520 years I haven\'t offed myself yet despite having had several opportunities to do so so I guess I don\'t have to worry about that too much That probably comes across as kind of morbid now that I\'ve typed it out but I think the main reason I haven\'t killed myself is that whole thing about being stubborn about my chances of figuring out a solution My guilt probably helps too in the sense that I feel like I have so much that should be great that most men don\'t have Plus if I figure this shit out I should have a pretty good life to look forward to so the potential reward is probably higher than if life was going to suck even if I found a solutionOn the medical front there\'s nothing wrong with me that\'s really worth noting Blood work showed low vitamin D which can cause depression but I\'ve gotten that under control with supplements My testosterone is supposedly normal I\'m physically at a good BMI in shape attractive etc I have a lot of tightness through my neck and shoulders all the time and tension headaches pretty often but that\'s so common that it\'s pretty much a given with the CPTSD thingSo yeah I don\'t really know what else to say This is stupid Bleh I\'m trying to think of anything else that should go hereI\'m very low contact with my parents I see them once or twice a year usually Thanksgiving and Christmas It\'s basically like I tolerate my mom in those situations in order to see my dad but as time has went on I\'ve started caring about seeing him less and lessI used to have these bouts of rage where I\'d just flip shit Well I still do sometimes but I used to too It used to be pretty bad and I was lucky not to ever get in legal trouble over it because it would happen in public sometimes too My therapist was of the opinion that I was/am dissocating in some form when that happens and I don\'t even know how to describe it but when it happens it\'s like I\'m watching my body do things but that I\'m not the one in control of what it\'s doing It\'s pretty fucked up and I had no frame of reference for just what the fuck was going on until my late 20sJust understanding what the deal was and how to notice when things are heading in that direction ie: physical sensations that lead up to it I\'ve been able to cut that shit down by like 95 percent or more I used to go off and throw shit kick shit over kick through doors beat shit over my head until it broke and all kinds of fucked up shit before I kind of cooled down When I was much much younger like preteen and early teens I would get into a lot of fights because of this kind of thing to give an ideaAt this point those bouts of rage are so different that it\'s almost funny how big of a difference there is To say it\'s like night and day is an understatement I can anticipate when I\'m starting to head in that direction because I get a very distinct set of physical sensations and when that happens I immediately disengage from whatever is going on and just go walk somewhere else or whatever the case may be On the off occasion that I do snap and throw something I\'m able to catch myself which usually coincides with me yelling FUCK and regain control almost immediately That happens about once a year or less at this point and it usually involves something ridiculous The last time it happened it was because I got caught one of those sticky fly strips in the side of the face and by the time I had gotten out "SON OF A FUCKING [word I apparently can\'t use in a post on this sub for whatever reason]" I had already caught myself which was pretty coolThe girls I\'m with know about my history both in terms of the anger thing and in terms of the overall mental health issue They don\'t really have a frame of reference for how bad it used to be in terms of being around when that was happening which I\'m pretty thankful for but I\'ve talked about it with them before and they\'ve seen me do ridiculous shit like spike a cookie in the kitchen floor I\'d say each of them has seen me snap in some form or fashion maybe 46 times each and the worst time lasted about 1015 secondsI\'m not happy about it and I feel guilty about it but it\'s very serious and measurable progress compared to the 15minute tirades I would watch myself go on The progress I\'ve made on this is one of the reasons why I still think I have a chance of putting a dent in this other shit I have going onSo yeah this is long as fuck and I expect exactly zero people to read this clusterfuck but I didn\'t really write it for sympathy or anything like that I thought putting it down might make me feel a little better or something but I mostly just feel like an ungrateful dumbass right now I\'m tempted to not even post this now because I feel stupid about it but I\'ve already typed up this longass thing so fuck it', 739807)
('&amp;#x200B;**Very long post thank you for allowing me to vent I am losing my mind and my sanity I don\'t know what else to do** TLDR: I have a toxic abusive family Specially my mother I am an only child and she has mental health issues but IDK what to do She takes medication now but just yesterday posted a picture of the devil on the facebook just with so much anger She thinks the world owes her something I want to run away from this environment but I cant just cut contact with her &amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;Since the beginning of time my family has a history of mental health abuse and violence We are a cats and dogs family Sometimes everyone gets along on holidays on special occasions but that\'s about it I consider the family to be very close too close They know too much about each other that for them it is easy to gossip about each other and create their own scenarios as an excuse to get upset They always find a way to be ANGRY at each other When I tell other people this seems like a normal scenario Except it isn\'t and it never has been Since I was a kid I have seen my family fight I\'ve seen my mother hold a knife to my uncle I\'ve seen my grandmother threaten neighbors with guns I\'ve heard death threats all around in the family towards others to each other I won\'t forget the day I was 5 years old and I had to run a block at 2 am to "Safety" to a neighbors house and ask them to call the police because my uncle and my mother were in a physical fight and a knife was involved I won\'t forget when my mother left our home and left me with grandmother so that she could provide but when she came to visit grandma would kick her out at gunpoint all because she wanted custody of me They fought because to them more than a child I was the one that filled the emptiness and got rid of the loneliness I was always "the little girl" that made them smile  Yet overattachment to me due to their own feud left me very isolated I didn\'t have friends during my childhood I had some classmates but nobody wanted to hang out with me because my family was always the one fighting Breaking things in the middle of the street insulting all the neighbors one time we had our dining table outside freshly painted and someone passed by to look at it and my grandmother walked out with a gun and threatened them to leave it alonethen she lost her shit and brought a mallet and destroyed it The scary parts didn\'t end there as there are hundreds of events I can recall of this psychotic yet loving family As a child I was abused People don\'t like to hear that and I am now grown and my understanding of mental illness has led me to feel guilty to even blaming anyone for their actions But it still happened I saw my cousins get beat with cable cords with broomsticks with punches and kicks I won\'t forget the day we were walking down the street my cousins and my aunt and she lost her shit over a joke we made and turn off her cigarette on our arms As my lovely mother brushed my hair and I was happy how I was only 5 years old and she got upset that I moved my head so she beat me with the hairbrush and then told me not to cry because then I would face the consequences The "consequences" the "you\'ll see" Are words forever engraved in my mind that I have feared because it meant for any action that I did that didn\'t seem right for others I could be beaten I could be punched and kicked and thrown on the floor With bruises so badly that others asked me if I had been in the sun because of how red my cheeks were  On how much I wanted to cry and scream but nobody listened and nobody cared enough With bruises so badly that I couldn\'t sit for days because my bottom was red blue purple green and black only because I went to a kids concert with a friend at 10 years old and turn my phone off Then my mother found me and started beating me up in the middle of this concert and the singer saw this happen but nobody did a thing We went home and I got hit so much so much and with so much anger with the excuse that "She had been worried"  How I tried to defend myself but she threatened to stab me and actually stabbed the counter next to my hand because I told her I would tell my stepdad to stop giving her money because I didn\'t know how else to stop it How I had no friends because my mother was jealous of my 12yearold friends being teens and dressing up with tight clothes so she made me stop hanging out with them Sometimes I thought she was right but then it kept going Every day til college where she welcomed the friends of mine that she liked but when I was 17 she still yelled and hit me infront of my friends and made me stop hanging out with them She didn\'t even let me party during prom she always chaperoned my school trips always read my text messages HIT ME and accused me of "opening my legs" at 13 years old because I had a crush on a boy So I could never have a boyfriend because she played the mother that wanted to be involved in school when she just wanted to control me I forgave but didn\'t forget all the times I didn\'t have meals or sleep or how I would come home from school and I would be beaten for any petty reason How all of our dishes and our food got broken and thrown out by her in our small apartment because she was losing her mind HER mind Her mental illness was real but I couldn\'t see why all the rage had to be directed towards me I was just a kid  A lonely kid How I didn\'t have my own room until I was in college so I had to wake up when my parents did I had to sleep when they told me to I only ate cereal for a while because my mother and my stepdad were fighting so much they didn\'t buy food  In 6th grade I remember someone asking me if I got punched because my black circles were so bad that they looked like I had black eyes Maybe  I did I don\'t remember My toxic family feeds of each other\'s manipulation control and need of power I know every abuse my family has suffered from rape getting hit since I was a little girl My innocence was robbed My mother not realizing I was just trying to live a life like any normal kid/ teenager using me as her own personal psychologist since I was young Trying to tell me how my situation wasn\'t as bad because she had it worse But I grew up not even having the freedom to cry or I would get beat not even when I missed my family All I heard are trash talk from everyone around I lived a life in fear controlled by others and finally in college I begged them to please give me housing because I couldn\'t live this way anymore I got myself through university and I had scholarships I lost 1 because my mother didn\'t realize that her behavior was affecting me I remember my step dad kicking us out every Christmas and we had to pack our things by new years to be ready to be out and then something would change and we would stay but the cycle didn\'t My mom always insulting him and controling him because she always thought she was right Refusing to let me drive I had to take the bus to school in the mornings and during finals I remember them not taking me to school My step dad wanted to sleep so he didn\'t take me to school during a storm and  I walked there I was 1 hour late to my final in tears asking my professor to give me a chance I got a D Not proud because that\'s all it took to lose my scholarship During college I had a friend my mom didn\'t like So she gave me ultimatums on either talking to my friend or never seeing my mother again She called me a whore she called her a whore she told me off over and over again then showed up to my apartment on campus when I tried to fix things with my friend and they started a verbal argument in my college aptas I was working My mother always wanted everything to be her way &amp;#x200B;They spied on me You know when my aunt was pregnant she sent me pictures of the ultrasounds and my mother saw all of my emails and NEVER told me about them I found them years later &amp;#x200B; But then she would love me She would be proud of me and take me shopping and do everything a mother did I am an only child and I understood that mental illness makes people do things they don\'t want to do I took the role of the punching bag companion comfort since I was a little kid When my mother took me away from my family I haven\'t seen them in 15 years because we are now in a different country US my grandmother tried to accuse my mom of kidnapping my step dad of rape so that they would take me away This also wasn\'t true but they just toyed and made up things to have me NEEDED control of my life and my future  I won\'t forget the day I finally grew up and held my mother\'s fist as she was about to punch me in the face And I said no more She did it after that and the threats continue And yet I love her so much and I am an only child All of my family is toxic I forgive everything and everyone but now I am 25 years old During my wedding she threw a lot of tantrums and disrespected my day and my husband because things were the way she wanted To her she is never wrong As we drove to California to get married and brought her along she stopped talking to my husband and threatened to have us drop her off in the middle of nowhere only because my husband didn\'t feel like cleaning his windshield so she could take a picture 2 days before my wedding during my wedding she was upset as well My pictures are hard to see because I can see it in her face A month ago we got in a fight and I defended myself Now she has this anger within her My grandmother came to visit us and my cousin who I had not seen in 15 years also did My mother fought with my grandmother over nothing broke dishes yelled and called me She called me to tell me to come to pick up my grandmother but she left me a voicemail of her yelling and verbally abusing my grandma But my mom doesn\'t see how paranoid she is Because I know what actually happened and my mom excuses her reactions saying that\'s okay Then after that she messaged me over and over again saying she wanted to just die and she wanted to kill herself Why do this to me I don\'t understand Then she leaves me worried and with all of these feelings and she "moves on" Now she says she just wants to be happy and she doesn\'t care about anyone if they want her in their life they can come to find her but she isn\'t going to show interest on anyone she wants to be "drama free"  She disrespects my husband she\'ll make indirect posts of facebook about my relationship insulting us  Without saying any names  but won\'t tell me anything to my face Her anxiety her anger is scaring me And I will still be there to love her but I am losing my mind My whole family thinks they can play this manipulation game with me and control me and when it doesn\'t work they lash out of me in all ways &amp;#x200B;I forgive you my dear family But I want to run away and I am sorry if it hurts everyone but I can no longer do this I am 25 years old You still disrespect me and if I say something you defend yourself with "I\'m just direct so deal with it"  I call people out on their bullshit and their mental games because I refuse to entertain them any longer Please let me live I want to live without damage I already wasted many yearsBut everyone tells me I\'m overreacting She tells me I get offended too easily she tells me I am crazy She acts like I\'m the problem I cannot do this anymore I am not like all of you who have loved me for your selfish reasons and controlled every single bit of each other I am my self I am my own person I am not you They only "loved me and gave me everything" they say I don\'t want any of it', 731227)

to me I don\'t understand Then she leaves me worried and with all of these feelings and she "moves on"Now she says she just wants to be happy and she doesn\'t care about anyone if they want her in their life they can come to find her but she isn\'t going to show interest on anyone she wants to be "drama free" She disrespects my husband she\'ll make indirect posts of facebook about my relationship insulting us Without saying any names but won\'t tell me anything to my face Her anxiety her anger is scaring me And I will still be there to love her but I am losing my mind My whole family thinks they can play this manipulation game with me and control me and when it doesn\'t work they lash out of me in all waysI forgive you my dear family But I want to run away and I am sorry if it hurts everyone but I can no longer do thisI am 25 years old You still disrespect me and if I say something you defend yourself with "I\'m just direct so deal with it" I call people out on their bullshit and their mental games because I refuse to entertain them any longerPlease let me live I want to live without damage I already wasted many yearsBut everyone tells me I\'m overreacting She tells me I get offended too easily she tells me I am crazy She acts like I\'m the problem I cannot do this anymore I am not like all of you who have loved me for your selfish reasons and controlled every single bit of each other I am my self I am my own person I am not youThey only "loved me and gave me everything" they sayI don\'t want any of itToday I choose to be free and I will seek help I will cut the chains holding me down that keep me a part of this cycle', 731227)
("I know that this might sound irrelevant or maybe that I'm complaining and I hate that because I dont want to be THAT person but I have to get out I have ABSOLUTELY no one who I can talk to or am comfortable around I have a lot of trouble to communicate with people and no one that I know wants to hear me speak at all I get yelled at for saying I have a headacheI've recently finished my Alevels and now am on a short break before I start university During my exams my grandmother would tell me that my aunt was angry because after my tests I'd be home with nothing to do Not true I have cleaning and organization to do I'd love to learn and study new things I'd love to read and get back into painting and writing because art is probably my true passion I'd love to be more active around the house than just basic cleaning maybe do more baking and better organize everything I want to spend more time gardening Just do human things I am not allowed to do anything besides studying or going out with my family because anything I want to do is considered a waste of timeI cant paint or draw I cant read I cant clean I cant do anything when I'm home besides sit where everyine can see me where I am not in the way and wait to help and serve everyone  The minute that I came home from my last exam I wanted nothing more than to shower after a long drive and errands and go to sleep or organize my notes This was at about 11pm Instead I had to listen quietly as I was yelled at insulted because I spent too much time in my room during exams I was slapped a few times but nothing like what it was at home by my mother I was screamed at My whole family was convinced that what this person was saying was absolutely right Now they're all angry with me and have been for weeks I havent gotten a chance to do anything on my schedule and its driving me insane People seem to think I'm OCD or have anxiety or autism I think im normal and it's just my personality I do things when they have to be done in a particular way If they have to be do e differently I will do it so Doesnt mean I have any sort of condition for being difference Either way I think and work a certain way Do I have to change it because everyone thinks differently They contrast with each other and no one cares about that I just want to sort through my things And i cant Besides this I'm yelled at all the time They put themselves in a situation and blame me For example I have my graduation dinner and had to buy a new shoe which I did not want because apprantly my sneakers and old sandals I've had for ten years now are too old and tattered I was doing my best to find a simple affordable one This member called and cried about how sick they are and how they cant go to work They said that they cant move and they dont know what to do So they stayed home and then said they're coming to the mall How does this make sense Then proceeded to get angry at me and pinch me because I didnt want to wear a literal 6 inch heel having never worn heels before and get angry because they have to go home and rest and I'm making it hard for them I'm also known to have problems with my feet and did minor surgery in January They bleed if I wear certain shoes styles Of course they insisted that confort does not matter and it's okay if anything happens to my feet I never say anything about my health so to say that was a lot in itself Maybe it is complaining too much to want comfortable shoes that will actually last but I dont exactly like having bleeding feet all the timeSince the whole after exam blow up I've just felt empty inside It's always like this They always blow up in uncontrollable fits of rage and I'm the target I dont talk to boys or girls But I'm called a harlot because my mother had me outisde of wedlock with on of her many partners They keep asking me if I'm pregnantI dont feel anything anymore I'm usually very scared and apprehensive And considerate of everything I say to the point that it's frustrating I dont respond and just take it all I have no confidence and I hate myself I'm still the same But something snapped inside me I started to defend my action when they yell at me and I dont know how to stop It's making everything worse They get angrier meaner and colder I was yelled at for being a slow eater and having a slow reaction time So when I went alone to do errands I ran and did them quickly So that they know I wanted to prove because the few people I'm comfortable around know that I cant run They dont taunt me bitterly and make me feel bad all the time I can run but only around people I'm comfortable with so basically by myself alone When I came out I waited for ten minutes and called them They didnt answer They came fifteen minutes later and I said I called you twice They got a bit annoyed so I justified it I said that I had finished and I was worried something happened because they only had to walk from the store to the car which takes only 5 minutes But after exapling myself it got worse and now they dont even want to be near to me because I'm annoying and selfish and apparantly timing them and me waiting by the car shows I have no patience or care for them I'm scared because explaining myself makes them more mad but I dont know how to stop myself It's like something emotionally happened and I dont FEEL anything like I used to My fear turned into this sort of panic that coats my skin I can't relax at all anymore Music and art dont make me feel happy anymore I dont feel happy anymore I used to always feel happy when I was alone Now I dontThings were going so well you know I learnt the secret Just agree compliment stay silent leave them alone  I'd be in school I'd come home I'd get yelled at I'd study And do homework And then maybe they'd tolerate me Maybe be neutral or supportive or loving I didnt care which once it wasnt negative It changed They themselves say that they only treat me this ways because they live with me and see me all the time Strangers and people with worse behavior and strayed better because they dont see them often  And then they held back during exams and now it's all flooding out And I have NO ESCAPE from it I stay in the toilet for about half and hour It's the only time I'm alone The only time I'm comfortable Maybe an hour if I'm really down That's all I get I'm yelled at for that too even though theres another toilet No one can go in the toilet if I am in the other It only applies to me though But im told I spend hours in there like is said I time myself and everything that I do to the minute so false even though it's less than they do  I'm yelled at for being selfish and wasting time I dont know what to do anymore I miss school I miss my teachers and friends I miss being able to be productive or relax without being yelled at for doing either I miss how encouraging it was I miss being around people who didnt demean me all the time I miss being around people who did not scream dont hug me when I passed them even though everyone knows I dont like physical contact I miss being free and comfortableI'm trying to be a better person I promise that I am I know that I need work They tell me that all my friends and everyone I know has it worse I had it worse back in my mothers house when she was drink and violent and angry But she loved me We didnt have water electricity or a car but she encouraged me She beat me but she was supportive and accepting She was just victim to an unseen illness Drugs are an illness and so is addiction Mental illness is a valid illness Its not so much physical anymore but the closer I and better I get at communication and the more I hear my friends speak and communicate the way that they interact with their families it makes me wonder How are they comfortable and confident if their families are also like this to them Why dont they talk about I don't talk about it but I use fillers to make them trust me and think I'm open I dont want them to know much about me Does that mean they're also hiding it But the how are they able to defy something their families said and be confident and have their opinion accepted The few times I've tried to hint no one believed me becuase as I said they're sweet to strangers And they can be very sweet Sometimes they're so sweet and loving and caring And I love them more than usual then But they have this rage and anger sometimes And it lasts for so long and its intense It's rare for them to happy They say that I have no problems I guess I have food shelter and clothes I have internet for goodness sakes That says a lot I have my own bed That's a luxury I didnt have when I was younger I didnt have any of these besides a home and food back in the days Part of me says they dont know anything about my childhood I never said anything My mother was too drunk to notice But part of me says that's invalid I was never raped I was never diagnosed with a chronic illness I was never kidnapped I never starved I was never homeless I was never beaten so badly that I hate cuts and injuries and couldnt move I never had the death of a close family member when I was young and vulnerable I was never in some tragic rescue story So how can anything I defend myself with be valid But as much as they say these are the only problem I can have they complain about small things Petty things Someone they hated got the promotion they wanted The didnt have enough foods they liked at a work party Someone they didnt like said something about them to a friend They got a bad review from a supervisor I get that these are valid reasons to be upset but I dont get how they can stay home from work and cry for hours literally to everyine about it for days and I can't even say that I have a headache without being told I'm lying and complaining I got yelled at just this morning because I was full and not hungry to wat as much as them This made me selfish and wasteful I also got yelled it for offering my help Apparently I'm annoying and complain about what I have to do I've said once that i have to finish cleaning for Friday since my relative is staying in my room and everyday so far I haven't been home I just need one day homeI also got in trouble about an hour ago because I had to wake a family member up who had just come home from a nightshift and I felt bad to disturb them so I said to another member I have to wake this person up but i dont want to disturb them because I know they're tired I hope I didn't read the tine wrong I got screamed at for being the stupidest retarded person ever who just loves to ruin everyone's day by being annoying and irritating I feel like every day I'm so scared to do anything I'm not allowed to make any noise If I want water I pace for a hrs in my room until they all go to bed or rest bc I'm so scaredSometimes I ramble too though I go on about things no one cares about and I cant tell like the Cuban revolution or something else I read about I dont mean to and I dont do it all the time I'm just confused and scattered mentally right now so sorry if this doesn't make sense I'm just reall numb right nowI'm just scared all the time that I'm doing something wrong I feel like I feel this way because something is wrong with me I should be happy to have what I ahve and I know what it's like without these things I dont know what right I have to feel sad and uncomfortable I just feel like I'm in state of unrest How can i overcome this I hope that what I've said is coherant enough I'm panicked overwrite and am typing this while folding laundry I'm too exhausted to type anymore Im sorryWhat can I do to stop feeling so numb and mute How can I feel happy and compliant again How can I be a better person so that they wont be angry at me all the time I feel like a horrible person I'm probably not even explaining the situation well and I know that this is a really small issue compared what most people go through but I just want to stop feeling like this", 727138)

('I woke up in pain  I took two tramadols as per usual and wish they were Vicodin God I miss Vicodin  No one prescribes it anymore thanks to the people who fucking abused it Thanks fuckers Some of us need it Thankfully I don’t have a fucking migrainebut body pain  from all the working out I’m doing at 35 to combat age stress anxiety and overall just to look decent could trigger one I overdid it My lower back aches my heels throb my arms are sore from the yoga I did in the morning prior to the run I forced myself on And my neck It’s permanently damaged It never stops hurting Ever Everything hurts a little more the older I get I feel so tired but can’t sleep My boyfriend who hasn’t had a job for almost a month until a week ago started a night shift so he wakes me up when he gets in at 5 and I can’t go back to sleep well so I was up at 6:30 hurting  Like if it were me I’d creep into bed and try not to disturb him but that’s not what happens  And fuck all if I *do* get a migraine I don’t have health insurance and I make too much money for Medicaid so I pay out of pocket for migraine medication because it’s cheaper than private insurance It’s still expensive though I have to walk on eggshells with my body and my sleep plus triggers to make sure I don’t get one My cat passed away Friday My precious boy I had to make the decision to put him down and it was heartbreaking and I literally held onto him while he died with my hand to his chest to feel his beating heart and his last heartbeat because I loved him so much  There is such a void here without him My ex husband is out to get me still after four years I thought he’d be over it because he’s engaged He still texts my best friend and says really weird shit and watches my IG stories on rare occasions which means he’s definitely looking at my IG It’s not private He has always has psychosis I just didn’t find out about it until we were already married and he got out of control  I left him for my now boyfriend He can’t get past that and tried to do horrible things to me when we were divorcing  I want to sue him for defamation but I don’t want to pay for a lawyer again My job is so wishywashy I love that I work from home but nothing’s ever like certain with clients or anythingit’s almost like freelance but not  Also I’m constantly on I get emails texts and phone calls at any time I don’t take them after 10 pm as my own rule And my bossshe’s finally gotten to be someone I can talk to but she’s so hard to read It’s just me and her she is the owner it’s her company but she’s never here and that’s fine by me She runs all over the world on idk what income exactly and does all sorts of expensive adventure shit and gets hailed as a brave woman who is admired for these extreme activities and I run everything behind the scenes I’m secretly scared she uses our company funds for shit I’m also scared she’ll die doing some of the shit she does—she’s come close a few times It doesn’t bother me at all that she’s gone and travels constantly But I want to tell the people who comment on her posts like “Oh my god I wanna be just like you how do you do what you do” “For fuck’s sake just about any of you can do the shit she does for the right price It’s money not skill” I write this but I don’t hate or envy her At all I just get irritated with people idolizing her on Instagram when it doesn’t even help our bottom line and people are so daft to think everything is so magical She bought all her followers—at least multiple thousands and finagled a blue check too I’m glad if it helps us businesswise but otherwise it doesn’t and as long as she doesn’t get rude to me like she last summer ever again I’m good  Last summer I almost quit because she got primadonna psycho on me but luckily we pulled through This year is better—a lot I still do a number of jobs within my job and wear many hats that are actually like one person’s job each thing and I’m doing them all And I’ll keep doing them for the money I make because I need all the money I rarely delegate things out to people but I’ve gotten better at letting go and giving people jobs to doI have two kids—they’re older a preteen and a teen That’s another reason I beat my body down with workouts besides just to combat anxiety and have overall fitness I want them to see me healthy and fit and thin and I also am vain I don’t want them to have “the fat mom” They never have and never will so I keep on I do intermittent fasting and they think I’m nuts but I explain when you’re 35 and have had two kids you can’t eat a whole bag of takis and Oreos weekly and look okay  I never push it on them My son is into music and acting and I’m trying to help him I’ve taken him to classes and LA all sorts of shit I want him to succeed My daughter hasn’t found a passion yet and that’s fine  I’m so worried I’ll go nuts when they’re out of school and gone I want them to go far out of state to school pursue their passions etc I’ve made sure they’ve seen Europe and other parts of the US at a young age so that they’re cultured I had to do this by myself  My parents are supportive but I don’t rely on them financially  I’m always terrified of having to I get so scared if I think about losing what I have and asking for help Back to vanity I spend a little extra every six months to get Botox so I don’t have lines on my forehead I consider it maintenence like hair highlights or teeth cleanings It’s not a filler  People think it’s a filler and it pissed me off No It just keeps me from making hard lines in my forehead and yes I can still raise my damn eyebrows I get stressed when I pay for it because I’ve become such a tightwad Don’t worry no one’s missing any meals at my house because of my vanity  My parents aren’t this way at all—I didn’t get it from my mom She’s super lowkey and couldn’t care less about designer things or makeup etc She and I understand we’re just different  She never lost the baby weight from me and she won’t stop drinking alcohol so she’ll never get healthier and it upsets me But she doesn’t drink like she used to I want the best for my kids I want the best for me I want the best for the kitten mewing outside that I started feeding I want the best for my boyfriend even though we’ve been through some *shitttt* Luckily no cheating or anything but he broke up with me twice last summer in the midst of both of our depressive episodes and has since come around to be very different in a good way but fuck I’m still low key traumatized that he could just change his mind That’s the thing Anyone can just change their mind At any time  I got invited to a swanky ass Christmas party and my childhood best friend begged to go so I brought her her husband and my boyfriend don’t even like this kind of shit and *she cheated on her husband that night* Brought a guy back to my fucking house She did exactly the thing you’re not supposed to do because that’s what people who are jealous assume you’re going to do to them I was like what the fuck My boyfriend assumed because I rode in a separate Uber that I cheated too and with the Uber driver It was awful for weeks and weeks He says he “forgave me” But I’m like you can’t forgive me for something I never did He hasn’t made a comment since February I’m selfish I want to do so much more and my career has some doors that could open for me Why am I scared that if they do I’ll be leaving everyone behind except my kids  I shouldn’t because if boyfriend who is much younger than me got an offer to go play for a good soccer team *anywhere* he’d do it Why do I feel guilty for wanting my big dreams I feel intrinsically that I am going to be or supposed to be doing so much more on a bigger scale I have so many of my personal creative projects I need to finish and I *can’t* because I’m drained of creativity through work and worry  “When are you going to write your next book” people ask Well fuck all idk because I’m too busy ghostwriting or doing other parts of my job  I ask myself when I’m going to finish that screenplay and I start feeling the anxiety of not doing what I love I needed to vent because I’m just mentally exhausted—not low depressed like last summer when I wanted to die I pay for *everything* and I’ve been understanding about boyfriend finding a new job and it taking some time but this is *not* the first time I’ve had to do this It’s exhausting carrying the load for everyone Oh and having to be like “No We’re not going to go buy a fucking snack” to boyfriend because he gets cravings and such and I’m becoming a tightwad to ensure my finances  I say my finances and not “our” because I learned the hard way to look after me first Oh And he keeps mentioning marriage now At first it was romantic and now it’s like hey can we go ahead and get married so I can get papers and go back to Central America and see my grandparents before they die Well fuck I’m not going to do that to myself I’m worth so much more But how do I tell himThe kids are spending time with family this month and I needed the break from cooking and delegating chores to them and making sure they did them It’s like being a boss on top of already being a boss with  work which gets exhausting  I miss them but I’m glad they are so happy with their cousins and get to spend time with them It’s easy for me to think I’ve got to be in control and it makes me a bad mom to let them go to the countryside for a month and not parent them But then I remember I parent all year long I am so all over the place I’ve managed to keep the home clean I got a new car and I’m a bitch about it to my boyfriend because he basically contributed to tearing my old one up I hardly let him drive the new one and I’m just like no We’ll take *your* car wherever I don’t care if the AC doesn’t work  I don’t care at all I’d rather be in your run down Altima with no Ac and an odd smell than my new Mercedes if it means I’m saving my gas my car mileage and risk I don’t care what car I’m seen in I didn’t get a luxury car for other people I got it for myself So being in a beater doesn’t offend me I’m so tired of being the one who takes on all the risk—in so many ways Thanks for reading  My problems aren’t nearly as bad as other people’s I know—but they’re mine so I’m the one that feels them  I want to go do an ayahuasca retreat or at the very least a solid trip on LSD because I don’t need a physical vacation I need a mental one All the things I wrote—they’re in my head constantly along with other fleeting worries thoughts and daydreams', 726668)
('Hey all this might be a bit long but I just have to get it off my chest and appreciate if anyone can offer me their perspective or adviceI met boyfriend through Tinder 2 years ago and it was a very hard relationship to start since I\'m a student 19 then living in a city A country A studying in country B while he 23 then is working already in city B country A But against all odds we tried and managed to last until last year when all the dramas happened Both of us are very perfect and imperfect for each other We have similar hobbies and interests my study and his work are in the same field we can tolerate and have compromised each other bad habits and in general both of us grew stronger as a couple but more importantly we have made each other a better individual together We see a great future with each other and all of these is enough to push us through 3 years of long distance relationship and we have knocked down 25 with only 6 months left 1 semester left for me Here\'s where things got complicated Little did I know he cheated on me with a lot 30+ of guys when we were doing long distance even when I was back in my country only 2 hours away I\'m in city A he\'s in city B He has never been in a healthy relationship where loyalty is valued and this is my first relationship and I was very \'innocent\' and \'naive\' believing that people don\'t cheat and someone you love would never hurt you like that 2 years of cheating and I forgave him for every single one of them partially because I\'m dumb and blinded my love scared of being alone and never being able to find love again At the middle of 2018 we were doing long distance he cheated on me again and started being distant and stopped being there for me and giving me emotional support But he didn\'t want to break up and would always beg for forgiveness after I caught him cheating he always got caught either I found out later or he would feel guilty and told me He wasn\'t there when I needed him and I have started to move on emotionally bit by bit I have never cheated on him at all even during the lowest point in our relationship but this time I couldn\'t resist and sort of cheated myself I was always scared what he would be doing behind my back and started to log into his Tinder or similar apps accounts and this one time I logged in on my account and this guy messaged me saying he\'s seen me at the nearby gym Let\'s call him Z I met up with Z for dinner and few more dates and Z treated me so nicely and I realised my bf has never done anything like this in so long on some other things ever I felt guilty of course and never really tried to pursue anything with Z it was just some sort of escape from my relationshipUntil this one time my bf and I had a fight and he have anger issues and would be really explosive when we fight He would call me names REALLY bad names insulted me attacked me even as far as personal things I was always the rational and calm one because once he\'s finished with his anger he would calm down and apologise Well this happened again and he blocked me on every single communication channel that we have he did this sometimes for \'punishment But this time his last words were "I\'m done with you bye" I wasn\'t sure if we broke up or this was just one of his anger fit but we stopped talking for weeks the longest it has ever been During this time I got closer with Z and we started seeing each other for almost 2 months before we stopped It was brief but Z made me happy and realised this is what a relationship should be Z ended it and it took me a while to move onI didn\'t talk with my \'ex\' for about 3 months and we met up start of this year I flew back and he found out about Z and he was hurt so so badly There were a lot of anger crying and a lot of talking but we decided to try again I told him I\'m still moving on from Z but there will never be anything else with Z It was harder than I thought to move on from Z there were some days where I texted Z for a little bit but nothing ever really happened I wanted to move on so bad that I decided to block him on social media but keeping his number just for emergency plus we work in the same place This worked I finally moved on from him But my exnowboyfriend still couldn\'t trust me even though what happened with Z was only for 2 months and I told him nothing will ever happen again There was literally only 1 guy I sort of cheated on him and he has cheated more than 30+ guys with me I guess he finally realised what it feels like to be cheated on and Z really messed him up We finally reached a place where no more Z and we can focus on each other again Except of course he started playing Tinder again because he wasn\'t sure with me anymore sort of keeping his options open But I didn\'t mind because he said it was all just to make friends and I just can\'t deal with all this bullshit anymore If he cheated on me again I\'ll leave All the fighting and drama just stressed me out too much that I just don\'t want to make a big deal if his intentions were really just to make friends The thing is he accused me that I too play Tinder and similar apps still I stopped long time ago and that I would still see Z behind his back Z live nearby and we work in the same workplace but different department My bf and I are doing long distance hence he was worried but I never see Z since last year and his insecurity and accusations would be so ridiculous that if I don\'t reply within 5 minutes he would video call me or that I have to send him pictures of who I\'m with and what I\'m doing Obviously he could never proved that I was cheating or talking to someone else because there wasn\'t anything or anyone to prove This got very tiring but I was still willing to try again so I put up with itLast week he called me in the middle of the night when I was sleeping He apologised and I went back to bed I woke up in the morning to this long paragraph of texts basically him raging on me because his gay friends happen to be a friend of a Tinder match I had 6 months ago we matched and talked for a day and I lost interest in him so I stopped replying He told me he didn\'t like having a boyfriend that a lot of people know and I guess he got angry as he was texting me and started cursing me and calling me names as far as me being cheap and similar words I had enough so this is the first time in 2 years I wasn\'t calm during a fight and fight back It was ugly to say the least Both of our last message agreed that this will never work and said our goodbye nastily He stopped replying and I was so done with this and finally started playing Tinder again2 days later he found out and raged at me again saying instead of \'reflecting\' I started playing Tinder again We fought again until 5am and after saying everything we wanted to say we decided we\'ll try again for 3 week as I\'m flying back to see him We both agreed that we\'ll decide whether we want to continue or not when we see each other and so for now we should just stop fighting as it stresses both of us out In less than 24 hours he started to accuse me again of still playing Tinder and that he hated how it made him anxious and insecure and blocked me again He blocked me on Instagram and Facebook at first then LINE messenger Whatsapp iMessage Twitter and Snapchat I tried reaching out on all of those before he blocked me but he would just block me again after he saw my messages I\'m afraid he would block my email if I try to reach out there as wellI was hoping by reaching we could at least talk and agreed to just drop it all and end it instead of leaving it ambiguous like this I\'m not even sure if he would want to see me when I fly back I have other things to do so I will still fly but seeing him was one of my main things This is exactly what he did last year around the time with Z He would blame me for not reaching out and even if I did he would blame me for not reaching out hard enough If I didn\'t reach out he would blame me for not trying again even though I told him I love him I still do but not like thisThe thing is it\'s so hard for me to let go because like I said in the second paragraph we have a great future together He wouldn\'t be like this when I\'m physically there with him usually during breaks and we wouldn\'t have to do long distance ever again in 6 months but he\'s acting up like this makes me unsure whether we would last even 6 months I\'m very happy with him and he is too but we can\'t seem to stop fighting because of trust issues and it exhausts both of us Part of me realises that I might be happier with someone else who will treat me better but on another hand I\'m scared that no one will love me for who I am like he would and that I will ended up alone I\'m just overthinking it I know but those thoughts are still there Has anyone ever been through something similar Were you able to patch things up or did you get out and find someone new Or are you alone now but happy', 721876)
("Throwaway because my spouse also uses RedditI often fantasize about running away from my life leaving my spouse and everything I have behind to start anew I often think about packing up and driving all night never to speak or see my spouse ever again My husband and I met in high school and we've been together for 6 years 2 of which we have been married for We got married young because he decided to join the military and figured that we should just tie the knot so that we could be together when he had to move Over the course of the last 1 1/2 years we have moved cross country 3 separate times and it's taken such a huge toll on my mental well being One of the places he's been stationed took us to an isolated town with less than 500 people where he would be on a boat that leaves for long periods of time There weren't any other spouses in the town and absolutely no support for me but I managed to make it through 9 months without too much difficulty When we moved for the second time we ended up in a small city where he had to drive an hour each way to work and would be gone for an entire week out of each month on top of 810 hour work days His assignment had a room for him sleep in and always keep him fed while he was on base so needless to say he was extremely well cared for I had to wait a month and a half for the moving truck to get to our apartment I was stuck by myself in shitty military housing with no air conditioner in California 100+ degree weather for over a month sleeping on an air mattress and living in a bare apartment with a suitcase with only a weeks worth of clothes and the essentials Did I mention that housing had no air conditioner We weren't allowed to put air conditioning units in so I had to make due with a box fan until fall ended I was so fucking miserable and had to unpack our things by myself when it finally showed up I had started looking for jobs and was getting calls back when my spouse wrecked the car It was my first car and I was so heartbroken because I had worked so incredibly hard to buy it as a teenager I took great care and pride in that car and he crashed it because he apparently didn't see that the vehicle in front of him was STOPPED at a red light This was in the middle of the day so I didn't understand how he could have just not noticed that His shipmates told me later that they said he looked really tired the day of the accident and even told him not to drive home himself but he did it anyways I was fucking livid Since he was at fault my shitty cheapo insurance wouldn't cover it even though it was completely totaled It still makes me sad and angry to think about how irresponsible he was that day considering he could have easily killed someone or even himself had the accident been any worse Regardless of everything he came home to a smiling face dinner on the table and a well kept place to live I did everything I could to keep him comfortable and happy because I felt like he deserved it because he worked so hard I felt guilty about not having a job so I tried very hard to make up for that by doing 95% of the household chores Well fast forward to our next move where we are now not even 8 months after our last cross country move I'm so fed up with moving and dealing with unpacking myself I'm fed up with having no family or friends or even a support group because we're so far away from everyone My husband is the least supportive person on this earth and he just expects me to figure out this shit myself every time we have to move He never ever does any chores on his own because he didn't have to do anything at his last two units you know because he was never home even after discussing things over and over until I'm literally nagging at him to do anything Meanwhile I'm expected to find a job get myself a car find friends unpack the house do laundry cook a full meal for him every night care for our pet etc all by myself while he works at his new unit and comes home to play fucking video games and do basically NOTHING He has a cushy easy desk job as he's told me and is home everyday no later than 3PM often times earlier than that But he NEVER takes me out unless I practically beg him and puts zero effort into our relationship He CHOOSES not to hang out with his friends outside of work and sits at his computer all day and all night sometimes until 6AM the next day like it's a serious addiction I feel like it's my fucking fault he acts like a spoiled teenager because he's so used to everything being handed to him or done by the time he gets home Our relationship feels so toxic sometimes and I've thought about divorcing him but I just can't bring myself to have that conversation because it would destroy him I think he loves me but lacks serious social skills and maturity to be a functioning married adult I feel like such a piece of shit for resenting him and even had suicidal thoughts because everything I've been through with him If anyone sees this I'll probably get called a dependa and get a bunch of hate for feeling the way I do I don't take any pride in being a military spouse and don't think this lifestyle is for everyone including myself Honestly I really want to leave and go back home to my family I regret getting married so young It was stupid and it's all my fucking fault for saying yes and going along with his narrative of how great things would be if I went with him after he joined the service I left behind a great life and now I have nothing and no one not even a supportive husband I gave up college and a job I really loved just to be a damn housewife I fantasize about leaving and going back to college in my hometown where I'll be close to my family and old friends and going back to my old job at the frame shop that I really miss I hate that I did this to myself and I wish that I had gotten myself together before naively getting married young It just really really fucking sucks", 714409)
('This is my first time posting on reddit and I\'m on mobile so don\'t bother the formatting Also English is not my main languageAfter reading the rules I\'ve decided that this is the right place to write my thoughts downEverything started when I was like 14 or 15 I met him through an online game and we got along pretty easy I\'ll name him Jay One of my friends was there too and soon Jay got introduced to my other friends and we all liked him He was funny and weird and just a cool guy Then he asked me if I want to be his girlfriend and I said yes I told my parents about him and of course they got curios and wanted to get to know his parents and see pictures of him and so on My parents liked him aswell Then we met Everything was fine my parents talked to his parents and they arranged a meetingIt was going well and Jay was cool as alwaysOn the second meeting we first kissed There\'s absolutely nothing wrong about that but he wanted more He was trying to kiss me with tongue I said no and he said that it was okay at that he was sorry Five minutes later he tried it again That continued a few times until he finally gave upThat should have been my first red flagSome time after that I broke up because I didn\'t love him anymore and we were still friends We were still playing video games together and had funA year passed and Jay and me were still friends and he was still in contact with some of my friendsHe visited me on my birthday and stayed for a week Of course my parents had nothing against it they liked him so that wasn\'t a problemHere\'s what I\'m still regretting to this day I don\'t really remember how it happened but we kind of made a deal or something The deal was that we would kind of behave as we were still together as long as we were comfortable with it and singleThat should have been my second red flag and I still blame myself that I didn\'t say no I just agreed with it and regretted it instantly I never told him I was not comfortable with thatSo he kissed me and I felt so weird I just wanted to leave but didn\'t want to hurt his feelings or something You have to know I\'m the person to look at the wellbeing of other people before I look at my own So i was like "I can\'t say no now that I\'ve just agreed" so I played alongAnd it got worseSo after I survived that week he went home again But that wasn\'t itOne day my parents came to me and asked me if I wanted to go to Jay since we would go to our relatives that live a few hours away from him And because I didn\'t think much and didn\'t want to explain to them why I wouldn\'t want to go to him I agreedSo my parents dropped me there and would pick me up a few days later I was kind of chilled because I was like "Only kissing is alright I can live with that"If only it was just kissing So the first few hours were pretty boring because we didn\'t know what to talk about so we kind of just sat thereThen he kissed me As I said I could\'ve lived with that Then it started getting more intense over the days till he would grab my breasts and massage them I was panicking and just froze I think he didn\'t even noticeI was never so relieved to see my parents I felt so used and dirtyHe came back to me a few months later I didn\'t tell my parents what happened I\'d have to tell them about the deal and I didn\'t want that they\'d see me in a different light So of course they had nothing against him coming here again This time for 3 weeksThat time was one of the worst times I\'ve had in my live But since the other ones are not important in this thread I won\'t talk about that ones nowSo he arrived everything was okay and since some of my friends and Jay got along with each other we went outside with them So basically that meant as long as I\'m not alone at my home with him everything\'s alright So I was super excited to go outside with him and my friends because I didn\'t want anything to happen Of course it only lasted till the evening when we went home againSo everything started again the kissing and the grabbing But it was worse this time He put his hands under my bra Again I froze Again I didn\'t do or say anything  Again I blamed myselfHe went even further with touching my butt and going under my pants in order to feel my butt better or something like that I don\'t know for sure because I didn\'t ask himThen after he did that he was asking if he went too far I didn\'t say anything because I was still kind of shocked and was thinking about why he\'d ask that after he\'d done something Shouldn\'t people ask that kind of questions before doing such things At least normal peopleSo he just moved on Again I felt used and dirty and I still couldn\'t tell anyone because I was afraid what they could think about meHe left and a few months later I told him the deal is no longer relevant since one of the two things being single and feeling comfortable with it was not fulfilled anymore Plus I told him I\'m busy this year on my birthday so he couldn\'t come visit me I know I should block him everywhere and shouldn\'t stay in touch with him anymore but I guess I\'m just a too good of a person to do that He\'s still my friend although I know a friend wouldn\'t do such thingsI\'ve not told anyone about that I didn\'t even tell my current boyfriend because I\'m afraid he might leave me or see me through different eyes He only knows a little bit but no details since I\'m scared about telling him about the deal I don\'t want him to think I\'m a slut or somethingThe only reason I\'m writing it down here is because I have to get it out

('Like many of you probably I have issues with my parents but it\'s hard for me to say that when they have given me a relatively normal childhood and provided me with a lot of opportunities and things I honestly wouldn\'t be where I am today if it weren\'t for my parents As a child they bought every toy on my birthday list and Christmas list and then some When I wanted to go shopping or hang with friends they would give me money if I asked and I didn\'t have to do any chores for it My dad transfered his GI bill which put me through college They bought me a pretty nice car and they pay for my insurance And to this day as I struggle after graduating they are still helping me out and spoiling me And I am very grateful for everything they\'ve done for me As wholesome as my childhood was materialwise it was far from stable It was so bad my older sister moved out when she was sixteen so she can get away from it all I was seven at the time My sister feels bad for leaving me behind but I was never angry with her because I always knew our family was highly dysfunctional and I understood why she left I was more angry at my parents for driving my only sister away and I pretty much grew up as an only child from that pointSo what did they do Well let\'s start with my mom She is selfish controlling dramatic manipulative and selfrighteous She always tries to victimize herself in literally every situation even when shes the antagonizer She also tries to control every aspect of my life from how I dress to keeping my hair long I\'m 25 and she tells me I\'m not allowed to cut my hair and she\'s not joking I literally cannot converse with her because every conversation just turns into a lecture about what to do with my life or how I should look I know lecturing is part of being a parent but sometimes I just want her to listen and to talk to me I can\'t even joke with her because she gets so offended Not to mention literally everything has to be about her If she doesn\'t get enough attention she pouts and throws a tantrum like a fucking child She\'s also incredibly jealous with my dad Since it\'s easier for my dad and I to hold a conversation if my mom feels left out she gets jealous of ME and tries to make my dad feel bad for not paying enough attention to her And randomly she\'ll tell me she thinks my dad is having an affair when it clearly isn\'t true And she constantly accuses him of cheating on her She just says that shit to make him look bad and to get pity for herself  She also does not take accountability for her actions She\'s an alcoholic and she blames that solely on my father She has also said some pretty hurtful things to me in the past and she denies all of it saying she would never say such things She called me a fat ass quite a few times which segways into my next grievance with her She is the source of all my body image issues She has constantly criticized my body because I wasn\'t skinny enough She forced me to diet and go to the gym with her when I was 13 and made me feel guilty about my weight when she fed me Even when I was at my smallest 120 lbs it still wasn\'t good enough I gained a lot of weight since then and looking back I\'m so mad at myself for thinking I was fat back then when I clearly wasn\'t And she still comments on how fat my ass is and how I need to tone up my thighs My mom always manipulates my guilt When I can\'t do something for her she always has to  remind me about everything she\'s "sacrificed" for me I always feel this need to seek out my mother\'s approval but every time I try it seems to never be good enough But when she\'s around her friends she\'ll brag about me left and right She\'s so focused on her appearance she always tries to curate what I say or how I look around her "friends" She also never has anything nice to say about anyone; always comparing others like she\'s better She is just a freaking messThen there\'s my dad I don\'t have as many qualms with my dad but it\'s still a lot to deal with For one my dad is an alcoholic and that is partly due to how my mom treats him and shit that happened in his past But when he drinks he turns into a major asshole He\'s threatened to kick me out one time for getting mad at my parents for fighting And he never apologized for it because he didn\'t remember saying that even though there were text messages to prove it He too is a  incredibly selfrighteous knowitall He thinks he\'s better than everyone and maybe that behavior is partly from my mom I honestly don\'t remember him being like that when I was a child Before he retired from the Marine corps I felt like he was more humble and kind But now he\'s got a really nice high paying job it has definitely gone to his head And of course his tolerance of my mom is waning so get is easily irritated Also he and my sister didn\'t not get a long at all he is not my sister\'s biological father I can\'t exactly say what happened between them but my mom took my dad\'s side instead of her own daughter And because of that my sister forever resents them both I\'m angry at my father for hurting my sister but he has been a loving father to me for the most part He would never yell at me or be too strict with me He would make sure I have enough money while I was in college and he would never make me feel bad for asking for money like mother does His love for me felt unconditional unlike my mother\'s love But I still cannot get over the alcoholism his disrespect and pride and also hurting my sister There\'s a lot more I could say about them but I think you get the point I just don\'t know how to feel about my parents I want to love them and be close but after moving out I can barely stand seeing their relationship anymore I\'ve tried talking to them but they refuse to take responsibility for their actions and change They just keep victimizing themselves and blaming the other for their own shortcomings I could cut them off but a part of me feels like that would be unjustified because they did give me a lot and opened a lot of doors for me But I can\'t get over my resentment for them and money can\'t heal everything Should I cut them off Should I be close Is there a way to balance it all I don\'t know but because of my family I have a lot of issues mentally and I\'m angry about it I\'m angry at the fact that my parents act like we are all a happy family on Facebook and in public but in reality we are more broken than you can imagine Sorry for the book there\'s just so much I tried to cut it down but it\'s the best I can do while feeling satisfied with letting it all out Thanks for reading', 688359)

cheaply or without taking a lot of time and I have a test that I have to take on Sunday otherwise I will be unable to go on to university I really wished I was in my home country right now but I can’t be And coincidentally my birthday is the 17th My test on Sunday lasts until 56 in the evening and it’s been a messed up week with tons of tests at school trying to be a part of funeral arrangements and read for my test I don’t really have time to get everything ready by Sunday evening and that would 100% mean to push myself way beyond my limits Also you can’t just keep putting off a funeral forever either But on the 19th I have a final exam for this semester in school Two days ago A told me that she would try to make it so that I could take it after I came home and I really appreciated that After class I went to the main campus to talk to the English speaking staff who manages stuff about us western people about it Because I’ve been through a lot before I have a nmom who I recently cut off which A knows a lot about too I try to stay positive and to try to make people not worry about me by doing good things for myself to show that I’m trying to take care of myself So I told her that I intended to have a small celebration of my birthday before going home Also mind you this conversation was in Japanese and at a moment I was giving my all to keep my emotions inside of me because I have to keep coming to school this week The staff was being very understanding about it all The next day I had ordered my ticket on the 18th meaning I would go to school until 17th so first thing in the morning I came to A to ask her when it would be possible to eventually do the test without mentioning any dates because I didn’t want to be too demanding The moment after she started yelling at me saying that she heard from the staff at school that I would celebrate my birthday that it was unheard of and that she wouldn’t let me do the test anymore I’m not exaggerating this happened I was so shocked and it was really the last straw that made it all boil over my dad had fucking died the previous day I didn’t know where else to go so like a middle schooler I was ugly crying for 30 minutes in the bathroom before I managed to calm down and enter the classroom so I wouldn’t end up with absence I was so shocked and honestly terrified to talk to A again after that experience I had had I was also really confused what the hell is going on Did a misunderstanding happen somewhere I’m also in general REALLY bad at being yelled at I can’t stand my ground if someone “over” me raise their voice at me because of how things used to be at home with mom So I decided to ask the staff I was so shocked and thought it was kind of unheard of to be treated in this way no matter what I had done when I literally just lost the only parent I have I felt like I was being looked at as a sleaze as someone who didn’t care about my dad dying and actually just wanted to spend the occasion getting free days off to party and still get to take the test So I just wanted to ask her what the hell was going on I told her that I don’t want the teachers to be so strict at me right now because of the situation I’m in and I would prefer if they could just talk to me I told her I think it is unfair if I can’t take the test just because I wanted to actually take the occasion to do something nice when it’s there also because I know that’s all my dad ever wanted for me She understood it all and didn’t even find it weird or seemingly unacceptable for me to do that whatsoever She said she would talk to A and I was relieved about it but at the same time terrified of what the response would be I got an email after I got home yesterday saying that I had to talk about it with A in person nothing else would do and that she was sorry about it The staff really doesn’t have any say in anything So both yesterday and today heartbroken sleep deprived in the height of grief I was also terrified about the conversation that would ensue My stomach still hurts and I’m still shaking After class I asked a friend to be close because I was so terrified of the conversation that would ensue From the moment I asked her if she had a moment she was visibly annoyed I tried to explain and then she cut me off without getting to the end telling me again how no matter what it was unacceptable that I said I would celebrate my birthday in the first place and when I explained that I never had any intentions of having a party or anything like that she blamed me really hard for not being more explicit without trying to have any understanding of language barriers or the situation She told me that if I wanted to go home I had to go home as soon as the test on Sunday was over and not expect special treatment And she was absolutely pissed at me for talking to the staff yesterday and when I told her while I was trembling and doing my best to hold back tears that I was too scared to do that yesterday she just told me that “it wasn’t scary” like there was no excuse And she told me that what I was doing would’ve been unacceptable anywhere in the world and that I had to act like an adult In the end she told me that she had to talk to other teachers about the situation regarding what to do about the final exam I don’t really see myself being allowed to take it to be fair and the conversation is going to have all her perspective and not mine I just don’t get it how she jumped to yelling at me from the first moment without even asking any whys or anything when she is probably one of those that knows my situation the best I’m so heartbroken and I have no idea how to study for the test now I’m just numb and shaking and my head and my stomach hurts so much If she thinks it’s bad of course she should tell me but I don’t understand how you would yell at someone who just lost their dad just the day before over cultural differences and misunderstandings Because yeah in my country I really don’t think I would get a hard time about any of this Maybe I messed up to I probably shouldn’t have said shit about my birthday and I don’t ever want to talk to anyone at school about anything other than superficial stuff ever again A treats me like I expect special treatment which I don’t I just expected that in these extreme situations the norm would be to be more understanding I don’t know what to do anymore I’m terrified of going back to school tomorrow even though A doesn’t teach my class I feel like they’re all going to be seeing me the same way and A honestly totally terrifies me at this point Usually id talk to dad about this and that makes everything hurt even more I’ve never felt like wanting to move back to my home country stronger than now and I’ve never even felt it before or any kind of home sickness I’m a mess Thanks for reading', 685530)
('Yeah can\'t really say I give a shit if this is the right place to post Just need to blow off steam and I know no comment will be able to help so it doesn\'t really matter if this gets taken down or not&amp;#x200B;There\'s a scene in Fire Walk With Me where Donna asks Laura if when falling through space would you keep going faster or something And she says you\'d just keep falling keep falling faster and faster until you burst into flames And no angels would help you because they\'ve all gone away I\'ve been dealing with depression since sometime between middle and high school and lately I don\'t know what to do I just feel like  crying All The Godamn Time And I\'m so sick of it I\'m so sick of falling into the same patterns I\'m so sick of feeling so alone and so angry and every time I used to get better I used to think "This is it There\'s hope I can get better" But now I don\'t see a future I\'m not suicidal but it\'s like the world just can\'t reach me anymore Like everything feels like a dream And I don\'t know what to do Nobody I could reach out to could help they\'ve tried and it\'s never worked Much as I love them And I\'m so sick of the same song and dance of me whining away to someone and getting their pity and nothing fucking happening I used to feel like there was always something I could grab ahold of to stop from falling further even if just for a little while But right now it\'s like I\'m scrambling away trying to find something and even though there\'s people trying to reach me I can;t fucking reach them Nothings catching me And I hate that I make them feel this way and that I worry them so much I\'m so sick of feeling so fucking far away from everything I just want to scream until my voice goes I want to scream so badly because it\'s like I\'m wasting so much time and so much love and I know only one of those things lasts forever I know life is short and I\'ve wasted so much of it but it\'s like I can\'t fucking wake up I wish I could just pinch myself and suddenly my brain would be like "oh right okay" You know But I can\'t and all the time I just feel like crying Like for no reason at all I just always feel like I\'m about to break down sobbing And I\'ve gotten way too good at pretending I don\'t&amp;#x200B;I don\'t have any real friends The one friend I have is far away emotionally and physically and he\'s told me that he\'s always there for me but same thing as before I\'m sick of the pity song and dance I keep thinking of better times of the kind of memories I want to make but feel so far away Of driving with a good friend in the rain and listening to music and just laughing Of feeling close to someone  I keep fantasizing of meeting someone like Dale Cooper or that priest guy from Fleabag Someone who understands pain and yet hasn\'t let it get to them Someone who feels like home I want to love someone to be held and to feel warm preferably someone with one of those adorable Irish accents cause that shit is just so comforting Hah&amp;#x200B;Because I remember feeling that once Someone and some place that felt like home the one place I\'d been happy in in years the one place that reminded me what happiness could fucking feel like It was only for two weeks and when I had to go home I remember having this huge pit in my stomach like I was making the biggest mistake of my life Like what I was doing went against every bit of my heart But I didn\'t have a choice it was just a stupid summer campAnd I haven\'t felt as happy since I just keep falling and my heart just keeps freezing over more and moreSo yeah Yeeep', 685236)
('This is a long post which is also my first post This has been bothering me for a couple years nowIt all started in my early high school days We were young and probably didn\'t know what we were doing It started with me seeing a girl I liked and taking a chance We became best friends and then one afternoon she confessed her love for me I was shocked myself The next day I told her the same thing and that\'s how it started We were official For about a year everything was perfect and we both enjoyed every second of it We would see each other every school day and be with each other for 45 minutes each day We very rarely hung out after school because she had strict parents Now I was a fairly popular person in high school and she wasn\'t She had about 4 friends while I knew and talked to a lot of people I guess I was a very flirty guy and I didn\'t even realize it I was really close to a girl in one of my classes and I guess her friend told her about it and made me "chill" She finally had enough after that girl and another girl asked me out in the same month She made it to where I barely talked to any other girls about anything anymore I didn\'t know really care much as long as she was happy I guess I did that a lot Doing what she wanted to make her happy However I started getting insecure when she would talk to guys and I did the same thing to her about talking to guys I didn\'t know think it was wrong because she did it to me but it was But the relationship went on After that first year things began to change We started to argue and get mad at each other a lot One day she really made me mad and made a mistake and said something I shouldn\'t have I regretted it instantly After that day in any argument that would come up I never liked arguing so I always tried to stop it by just listening to what she had to say until she stopped She would say some bad things about me sometimes and would always end up crying afterwards After most of the arguments we would apologize to each other and move on We tried to fix this whole thing and it started working for a while again We both removed the stupid no talking to opposite gender rule ever though we didn\'t like it I\'m not to sure why but the relationship just wasn\'t working again around the ending of the second year We would argue and I just did my thing again by letting her talk because I didn\'t want to saying anything I would regret I started to feel like I was a disappointment Like I wasn\'t enough for her I got pretty depressed She tried to make me feel better and after while I did I heard from a lot of people that she was talking to some guy in her math class and I didn\'t really care because in my head nothing would happen 5 months later she was telling at me and I said something and she punched me in the face It wasn\'t a hard punch but I was still shocked She had never done anything like that before She realized what she did and started crying I tried to tell her it\'s okay to get her to stop  The next day she comes to me with I can\'t be with you anymore because "I" made her cry too much I was so mad and sad I just walked away I hadn\'t cried in about 3 years but that day some tears came out I didn\'t say this earlier but she would always say things like yeah we\'ll be together forever and stuff I should\'ve known it wasn\'t true She tried to text me for a couple weeks after that but I was so mixed I just yelled or ignored her Eventually she had enough trying and told me to forget it and her and lots more I eventually forgave her until I saw she was with another guy not even a week after I talked to her and she actually hugged and kissed me even though she was in a relationship already I asked her about that and she said if we were meant to be I\'ll see you in the future But I cut her off from my life completely I went into a deep depression and cut off a lot of people I didn\'t know who I was and who were my friends I lost trust in everyone Eventually I found friends who love and care about me This bothers me still because every time I would see her I would remember it all and I always say it\'s my fault and I hate myself I still think about where it all went wrong My friends tell me we hung out too much but I\'m not sure I\'ve never told anyone the full or even half of the story Since then I haven\'t been the same I became antisocial and shy when I used to be very outgoing I still have trust issues and haven\'t been in another relationship since I am also awkward now which I hate I sometimes wish none of it happened but I did enjoy our first year together and that I don\'t regret To those of you that read this whole thing feel free to comment or msg me if you want to talk Thank you for reading', 682106)
('I know this is long but it’s worth the read A little background: Growing up I never had a healthy relationship with my body or with men My father was verbally and physically abusive and reinforced the idea into my head that no one could ever love me I struggled with my weight and developed a binge/bulimia eating disorder by the age of 13 For most of high school I had limited time for my social life as I made my studies my priority while my mom and I were moving from place to place to get away from my father Because of that I never had time to experience a relationship or experiment with guys as most other girls that age do I spent the summer after graduating high school and my freshman year of college I went to school out of state on a partying rampage I developed a drinking problem and was sexually assaulted while away at school That is how I lost my virginity I wanted to take back control from that and started getting drunk and having casual sex with a couple of guys at my college I ended up leaving behind my full ride because of my drinking and the assaults and became sober from drinking I enrolled in classes at the community college in my town Since leaving college and stopping drinking I couldn’t get myself to soberly hookup with a guyI was very depressed and lonely at home All of my friends go away for college and at the time I was still stuck on a boy who only saw me as a booty call back at school so naturally I downloaded tinder I had used it before at school to see who that I already knew irl thought I was attractive but I had never met up with a new person Apart of it was definitely a fear mainly from my body dysmorphia that I didn’t look as good in person as I did on my profile and the rest of it was that I had never had sex while sober before Initially I didn’t have a master plan of leading some poor guy on or even of getting into a relationship; it was just for fun but then I matched with Drew He was attractive older had the same dry sense of humor as me and most importantly was very far away He had been in my area briefly for a connecting flight but by the time I swiped right he was a solid 8 hours away back at school I figured any guy around me that I started talking to would only allow me a short window of time to talk before wanting to meet up for sex With Drew it was different he was so far away that I could extend this time as I had a valid reason why it was so hard to come see him He like many tinder users made it clear from the jump that he was just looking for sex and wanted to know if I’d be in his city anytime soon It turned out that my Bestfriend’s college was only 30 minutes from his and so I used it as my in I told him I should be visiting her within the next month or so and used that as an incentive for him to talk to me At first Drew was an ass He was probably aware of the low probability of us actually ever meeting in combination with the fact that he just sucks in general He was so dry and hard to have any type of real conversation with but always complimented my physical appearance One day after about two weeks worth of failed attempts to crack Drew’s tough exterior he threw out an insult about my personality In my sick brain I took this as a challenge I had way too much time on my hands and decided I wanted to make this asshole fall for me It wasn’t that I was even that into him I just wanted to see if I could do it I figured the best place to start was by seeing what he liked and then making him think we had a lot in common and as it turned out him and I actually did have a lot in common A week into me mentioning our similarities he started to open up more I used to stay up late at night because that was when he was the most willing to talk and I used that time to demonstrate how “interesting” or “funny” I was Before I knew it we were having longer and more meaningful conversations I could feel him liking me more and more and I became addicted to it Although I could sense his attraction for me growing Drew was not shy about the fact that I wasn’t the only girl he was talking to In fact he purposely brought it up to incite jealousy in me and it worked It made me more competitive I was putting more and more time into this twisted experiment Looking back there were so many red flags about him being a bad person but in my mind it only justified what I was doing I would never want to lead on a genuine and nice guy but it was clear that he was a jerk to women and just the people in his life in general After a while it stopped feeling like a game Even typing this all out and thinking about it’s origin seems so weird to me because it developed into so much more as cliche as that sounds Attraction and lust set in and I suddenly stopped seeing him for the blinking red stop light that he is I started to have feelings I basically stopped talking to any other guy and my day was consumed by coming up with the next witty message to send him or the next way to wow him I made him laugh sent my best nude pictures sexted him like I was a porn star and made sure he knew I was intelligent and had a future I wanted him to think I was the perfect girl Even when I was out or with my friends I was glued to my phone waiting for his response Once I was hooked on Drew the reality that if I didn’t meet up with him at some point this whole thing would end sent my anxiety through the roof I became sick over the idea that he would see me naked and not think I was hot enough I started becoming obsessed with my image I lost weight and started going to the gym everyday I ended up getting into the best shape of my life and adapting a very healthy lifestyle that’s probably the only good thing that’s come out of thisMy school getting a job my other relationships etc was all put on the back burner so I could make him mine In fairness to me I didn’t change everything about myself to make him like me but I spent way too much energy into showing him why I’m likable I made him my top priority and main source of happiness and it was extremely unhealthy Finally it happened the unattainable guy admitted he had feelings for me and not too long after that wanted to be exclusive with me and then finally he was willing to come all the way to see me At that time any memory of the jerk who I first talked to was gone he was the sweetest guy in the world to me at that point and would do anything for me He seemed like the perfect person let alone boyfriend The night before I met Drew I probably had about 7 panic attacks Every rejection senecio possible ran through my head “What if I wasn’t as funny in person What if I was awkward What if I wasn’t as pretty as he thought” Drew came to my city for a weekend We had the best time and it went as perfectly as it could have He was a perfect gentleman and didn’t pressure me to do anything I didn’t want to We went on a bunch of fun dates and adventures and he was super cute to me and romantic He asked me to be his girlfriend and I was on cloud 9 We were dating for a couple of months before it all came crashing down I was so busy trying to make him like me that I never considered if he was even worth liking The idea of him and the reality of who he really is didn’t line up He made any obstacle in the relationship seem minor and had an answer for any problem It turns out he had a lot of problems of his own to sort out that he minimized or hid from me In the end he became cold and distant and started partying at school every night with his friends and made less and less time for me He had a criminal record that prohibited him from getting a job and was facing jail time with an upcoming court date He was truly in no place to be in a relationship but every time I tried to end things he wouldn’t let me and pulled me right back in He had an excuse for everything and kept telling me once he got his shit figured out he could be the boyfriend he used to be I finally put my foot down and told him I won’t be in a relationship with him treating me like this and he finally let me go He has completely shut me out at this point and it’s for the best Our relationship was very toxic I miss him like crazy and still care about him even after he hurt me It sucks knowing I put so much time and effort into something that was so unrealistic but ultimately I was pretty fucked up for starting this in the first place As immature as this all was I learned a lot from it I’m picking up the pieces now and finally taking care of neglected parts of my life and working towards a healthier path Morale of the story is don’t change yourself to fit anyone’s mold or try to make someone like you The right person won’t need any convincing Also be picky about who you invest your time and energy in', 680739)
('Hey guys I am writing because I am so lost at the moment I really need you guys to not sugarcoat it and tell me straight up what I already know in my heart [Very] Long post ahead My husband and I started dating each other in 2012 We were long distance as I was going to one college and he another out of state At the time I was 19 and he 26 I was head over heels for him and we were dating long distance with our main communication being texts calls and FaceTime He would find every opportunity to come visit me at school and I was in pure bliss for about two years At the time we first started dating this girl “J” would always add me on Facebook I saw that she’s a mutual friend between my husband boyfriend at the time and I However I do not accept friend requests from people I don’t know So I would delete her And she would add me back And I would delete And this continued to happen about another 4 times or so So I was really weirded out but whatever Then a few months later in his car trunk I found a sorority jacket that looked very familiar I realized where I saw it from on Facebook profile pic I asked him “Is this J’s”  He said yes I asked why do you have it He said he hung out with her and she forgot it he have to give it back to her whenever he sees her next Mind you he has never mentioned hanging out with a female friend I don’t care if he has female friends as I have male friends that I hang out with too So I brushed it offNew year 2015 we weren’t able to be together as we live in different states We FaceTime to ring in the new year together he said he was hitting up the bars at his college town I said cool have fun We hung up 5 mins later J messaged me on fb and told me to text my boyfriend I was scared of course worried he had gotten in an accident or something I called he answered he was fine So I was like wtf is going on J messaged me and asked if I knew who she is I said you’re a mutual friend She said it’s a private matter If he want you to know he will tell you I just got such a dreadful feeling and I Facebook stalked her I found out they went to the shooting range together recently without my knowledge I asked him did they have history He said no He gave me all his passwords to everything I went on the email and saw that they were fuck buddies before we dated I was so upset because you just don’t stay friends with people you had history with We argued on and off about her for a few months I had spoken to her as well she told me they’re just friends now he loves me and is going to propose to me I had weird vibes about her and he promised he would not hang out with her anymore Soon after he proposed to me At this time we were following each other on find friends one night/early morning I couldn’t sleep I checked his location and he was driving around I thought it was weird as it was 4am and he didn’t text or call me I kept an eye on his location and when he stopped at this place for a long time I called him and no answer He didn’t answer until an hour and a half later even though I was calling him I screenshotted his location from that night He told me he couldn’t sleep he was driving around to think At this moment in time we had just gotten engaged we just got our groove back I didn’t want to rock the boat So I just kept it in the back of my mine and I moved to his state after I graduated that summer After I moved there while I was bored I decided to play detective and drove to that address that I screenshotted that night My crazy ass checked the mailbox I know federal crime looking for J’s last name but a different family lives there However they’re the same ethnicity as my husband and I and J  I didn’t think much of it I started hanging out with my fiancé’s friends whom he work with one of the girls invited me to her house for girls nightand guess whose house it wasthat’s right The address that my fiancé was at at 4am and was there for an hour and a half and didn’t answer my calls when he said he couldn’t sleepI questioned him about it he said he have no idea what I’m talking about I sent him the screenshot he said he seriously have no idea he was driving around a lot during that time when we were having problems That girl’s house is K Idk she was super nice to me her friends and her quickly involved me in their group and I became more of their friends than my fiancé even though they were friends first Maybe it was because I’m in a new town knew nobody and I felt lonely so when I started having a group of my own I forced myself to forget about iteven though I never forgot My husband at the time had a coupe and I a SUV I had made a comment that eventually we would need a bigger car maybe a 4 door as a coupe is small and it’ll be hard to get a care seat in when we start a family He started looking around for another car however I didn’t know he was serious about trading his coupe for a 4 door One day at work he said he had a surprise for me When I got home he drove up in a new 4 door infinity I had no idea he was seriously actively looking No idea he found a car No idea he was going to sell it He said he got a spacey car because I wanted a spacey car In my shock I had mixed emotions yes it’s sweet he took the initiative to get a different car however I would’ve liked to be included in the decision making as we are engaged and soon to be marriedI would’ve liked to went with him to sell it and went with him to pick out the new car I didn’t want to overreact as he was so excited about the new car so again I kept my silence We got married in 2016 Call it coincidence or not on his bday that year after we got married I had a weird feeling So I went on her fb again and on her cover pic was a pic of the coupe that he soldthe EXACT SAME CAR I was in such a daze that day It’s his bday I didn’t want to completely lose it However internally I was losing it The next day I asked him why does J have the same car as you just sold He said he doesn’t know he can’t control what people buy He asked why am I always stuck on J I asked for the paperwork of when he sold the car he gave excuses such as he’s waiting for their signature he doesn’t have it he have to go get it Blah blah In my heart I JUST KNEW IT’S HIS COUPE THAT HE SOLD TO HER I just couldn’t get him to admit it So again I let it slideFive months after we got married FIVE MONTHSwe went to eat dinner He always leave lotion on the side pocket of the passenger door for me I reached down and picked up a pair of keys It was dark that night however I could make out a Disney finding dory and Disney cars keysclearly a woman’s keys On the keys were an infinity car key My heart sank My husband has a black infinity rubber cover on the key this one had a red infinity rubber cover on the key obviously it’s a pair And I just knew without a doubt these were J’s keys My husband was shocked and he said they were a clients keys I asked why do you have a clients keys he said Bc they had the same car he wanted to go compare cars He basically pulled some bs out of his ass and it didn’t make no sense So I said to myself ok fine there’s a cover on the keys I will check tomorrow to see if they keys are spray painted silver as his coupe’s keys were painted silver When I got up for work the next morning I rolled down the rubber and sure enough the keys were painted silver I took the keys with me to work that day On the keys you could tell she is living at a college apartment as I used to because it had a gate clicker a gym badge small keys probably for the mailbox and other keys for whatever reason Call it fate the keys also had something on it with the name of a college apartment I called pretending to find the keys in the library and I said I’ve been calling around to all the apartments because there’s the name “J” and last name” on it Of course the girl confirmed that yes J lives here And I freaked I demanded phone bills and went looking through them They did not talk a lot Maybe two or three texts every 5 months or so He said her car wouldn’t start so she asked him for help to come jump her car I was so angry We live in such a big city of all the people she could’ve called she called my husband And fine let’s say that’s the case why are her keys in the passenger door Wouldn’t she need her keys to start her supposedly dead car While looking through the phone bill I saw a number that kept pooping up late at night and they’re texting back and forth constantly until the wee hours of the morning I checked the number in my phone it’s K’s numberI questioned both of them about it They said they’re friends claimed that at the time K was texting my husband so much bc of her boy problems and needed advise from a guy’s point of view Yes she is known in the group to have a lot of boy issues in the past as she was stuck between two guys at the time however she started dating her bf and has been dating him about 6 months when I found out they were texting a lot I was too involved with this whole J situation to be worrying about K and I didn’t want to believe she could do something that malicious to hurt me especially since we became such good friendsMy husband and I made up We worked on our marriage For 2 years as each day went by I was finally becoming happy again and felt secure about our marriage finally I was able to forgive him and move forward Of course in a marriage we would bicker here and there however I fell deeply in love with him again We were going to try to start a family this was Until February when I was looking through his email to cancel a subscription and I accidentally clicked on Photos it was just pics of his cars and as I went to close the mail app my finger brushed the screen up and I saw something really weird as the app closed out So I went back in and saw naked pics of Ksent to my husbandIt turns out while in 2015 when I found out about J and we were so fragile and he was doing all he could to win me back he started messing around with Kthis girl who befriended me kept me close to keep an eye on our relationship and my husband totally blind sighted me and stabbed me in the back I practically gave her the knife to stab me in the back The time stamps on those pics were in 2016 a month before our weddingwho knows when they stopped or if they ever did Meaning they have been messing around since at least 2015 or not 2014 In my blinded rage I sent the screenshots of their convos about how she want to do whatever she want to him but is scared have to look out for him and for her how she’s not proud of doing this and a bunch of fucking bullshit to our text group with our friends and exposed them At the time I didn’t know K and her bf of 2 years were on a break/broken up/whatever I included him in the group chat as well And shit hit the fan She immediately started calling me texting me saying I need to hear her side of the story She texted me and said at the time my fiancé told her he was single so she didn’t see anything wrong with that However when she meet me they stopped And a bunch of bs Obviously she’s lying bc of the time stamps A bunch of stuff happened since February I meet up with her we talked and I had my closure My husband moved out to live with his parents And I left the country to go back to my mother country for 3 months to get away and to think He also flew here for two weeks and asked me to give him 14 days and in those 14 days can we live to the fullest and not speak of the past and just be in the moment I have 12 days left before I have to fly back to the states Right now I am so broken I don’t even know where to begin to heal from this I feel so played and so cheap Like because I love him so much and he knows how much I love him he did whatever his heart desires because he is selfish and greedy I can’t believe I was so naive and so blinded that I ignored every single thing and tried to live in my happy bubble for as long as I could That bubble burst And now I’m so broken and lost I’m so angry at this “friend” who always asked if we are ok who I shared my marital ups and downs with as she did the same with me with her relationship that’s what girlfriends do right I just can’t believe they carried on for as long as they did and when all of us hang our together as a group they have their poker face on I want to get a divorce However I am not strong enough to leave We have three dogs together What will happen to our pups I love him however I am not in love with him anymore I don’t trust home anymore Whatever that comes out of his mouth I just want to laugh I look at him and want to punch him in the face However there was a sudden death in the family and my world got shaken up even more I question myself if he died then how would I feel Will I be able to forgive everything if he’s gone The answer is yes I would forgive him in a heartbeat rather than him not be in this world anymore My husband is a good man he is respectful to my parents and adults educated never raises his voice whatever I want I get so sweet to our pups however the emotional support and the mental side of this I do not have from him Whatever we had he destroyed it And now I don’t know how to get it back or if it’s even possible I feel defeated I feel lost Why was I not enough What did they have that I didn’t have What did they have that he kept going back to them My self worth and self esteem is gone I trust nobody now I cut off everyone from that friends group as they were friends with K way before I came into the picture I’m always angry always anxious and always scared waiting for the other shoe to drop Overnight I grew the fuck up I learned the most bitter lesson in the world', 680337)
('So funny story I guess to fully explain it I’ll have to start at the end of January 2018 when I started the spring semester of my sophomore year When I started my english class I met a boy who we’ll call N I couldn’t stand him I thought he was probably one of the worst people I had ever met He was obnoxious and arrogant Soon after starting the class one of my friends told me about how she liked him and at the I was actually disappointed in her I didn’t understand how she could’ve had interest in someone so awful the longer I spent around him the more time I spent talking shit about him and people eventually jokingly started to accuse me of liking him and after awhile I started to realize that maybe they were right  and they were but now I was disappointed in myself and tried to push those feelings down but I did tell my friend who had liked him about it and I guess she was pissed so she lied to me and told me he hated me this was a lie at the time however I believed it due to the fact that he seemed like a terrible person still so I decided to lay off of it because it was just a waste of my time but I still knew I had feelings for him Summer came and I thought about him occasionally but I felt like the crush I had on him was gone and I told myself it was wrong to like someone that a friend likes summer ended and I started junior year my friend still liked him and so I’d listen to her talk about him and all the arguments she’d get into with him for fun blah blah blah it always bothered me but I felt like he deserved it because again I still thought he was a total asshole but again as expected I once again realized that I still really wanted to at least know him better still didn’t act on my urges said I was over him and that I was fine hearing about him from my friend and I was but sometimes it made me jealous Big leap in time from last fall/winter to February of this year when I started the spring semester of my junior year I’d see him every day twice a day first when walking from my second period to my third and then at the beginning of fourth period I was still telling myself I didn’t want him and that it would be a waste of time to try to talk to him  to clarify at this point my friend didn’t really have anything going with him so I felt less concerned about that and after awhile I decided that maybe I should try to talk to him my feelings weren’t leaving and my friend no longer liked him so what was the point in holding back so fast forward to April my subtle attempts and plans of talking to him never fell through so I had another of my friends add him on snapchat for me because I was too much of a fucking p*ssy to do it myself spent the whole day after my friend added him being too afraid to check as i said i was a FUCKING P*SSY so I made friend check if he added me back too and he did So then I started talking to him and to my surprise the conversation quickly turned sexual which at the time I questioned but wasn’t upset about we sent nudes and all that fun stuff and I didn’t talk to him for a couple days after that but then I decided I wanted to talk to him again and it went fine at first until he asked me for something  which i sent and then said he never asked for it even though he did using the words “show me”  after that i apologized and was 100% sure he was never going to speak to me again this was April 22nd fast forward again to May 27th after I cried about it and had several awkward run ins with him at school he apologized to me This made me extremely happy like I was giddy for about a week because of itI texted him again about a week and a half after it happened June 3rd the conversation went decently and then he texted me again the next day I was happy; but also disappointed because some of the things he said made me feel like he really had no interest in me and used me to boost his ego and finally this Sunday he texted me and told me it was sad that I felt like I wasn’t good enough for him yeah i told him that and that he thought I was cool and that he likes my hair we talked for awhile and then once again a sexual conversation came up and he told me something kinda weird but not weirder than the types of things I’ve heard from people before I don’t wanna say what it was in respect to him and because I really don’t think it’s that bad just not something he’d want me sharing with other people but anyway I said something that I guess he didn’t like  wasn’t even about that and he left me on seen and know what you’re thinking at this point “wow you’re dramatic” and yeah I am I am very dramatic and it’s worrying me I’m constantly delusional over what’s going to happen with him and thinking that he hates me and it makes me feel really sad because I’m pretty sure that I’m in love with him  I think about him all the time and I really just want to be with him but sometimes it feels like I’m just wasting time and that I’m an idiot and other times I feel like i’m being too dramatic for thinking he hates me over every little thing I don’t know but to be honest the whole situation has been really taxing on me and at this point I don’t know if I should continue to try to push something with him or if I need to give it up Also to clarify I’ve never told the friend of mine who liked him about anything because I know she’d kill me  even though she doesn’t like him anymore and they were both really bad for each other Sorry if you actually read this and feel like it was a complete waste of your time I know it seems stupid but it really means a lot to me right now and I just don’t know what to do', 680330)
('I turned 16 last week and yesterday school ended During 2019 I have been skipping a lot of school and ever since 2017 I have been living a very weird life# When My Life Went Down The ShitterBack in 5th grade when I was about 12 I was decently popular I had a lot of friends and I was generally liked by most of my family Then 6th grade began and I was very awkward and silent all of a sudden most of my friends were in the other "group" in Sweden we have several groups per grade not sure if it\'s like this in other countries so I felt kind of lonely I didn\'t go out with friends a lot and I mostly spent my time in front of my computer playing games I was incredibly awkward around girls looking back and I was getting picked on quite a bit though I still had friends that I knew from 5th grade and the previous school that I hung out with at schoolThen 7th grade began and I was picked into the "B" group with most of my friends Two friends in particular I\'ll just call them N and A were my best friends at the time We talked on skype off school and would hang out a lot during school though during this time I began to enter puberty in a very weird way My voice was light as hell and I looked like a baby but I was developing acne all over my forehead It wasn\'t that bad at first though and over time I didn\'t really bother with it and by the end of 2016 halfway through 7th grade I was pretty popular in my group I was generally liked by most people at that point and was friends with most of the guys in the groupI should also say that at the end of 2016 me and my two best friends N and A really began to talk a lot on skype and it became toxic as all hell when one night we all confessed who our crushes were A\'s crush was a girl from the balkans mine was an arabic girl and N\'s crush was a girl who liked to fish so we began to joke that A liked baklavas a balkan pastry I liked bombs kinda fucked up and N liked fish Over time though it became very onesided when N and A basically began to gang up on me and throw bomb jokes at me every single second which made me get angry and try to insult them both with the fish and baklava jokes making them think I was fine with it and gradually making them become better friends with eachother than I was with them both Around this time my grades were also at an alltime high and I should also note that I was very skinny then I was about 155cm tall about 5 feet and weighed only like 35 kg which is like 77 lbs might be wrong about that thoughThen in 2017 my acne really became a problem I grew really insecure and started skipping school a bit when the acne was especially bad and we got new people in our class who were pretty bad One of them was a really rich kid who hanged out with some bad people and had done a lot of bizarre things he had taken drugs too which was especially fucked up considering his ageMy friends began to drift away from me a lot here another friend let\'s call him A2 began to pick on me and so did my "friends" they began to kick me out from skype calls and the time that I remember especially well was in march 2017 We were skyping with A2 when he suggested they kick me from the call N did so and I wrote all of them asking to add me back they all refused and I was angry as fuck about that and by like 12 pm when they had finished their call A who is a very quiet and introverted dude and also my longest "friend" called me and told me about all the funny and awesome things they had done in that skype call I didn\'t say anything back because I feared being alone and without "friends" I was also being picked on a lot at the time in school for the acne and for being super awkward and skinny which made me even more awkward and made me skip school a lot more By the end of 7th grade my grades had gone down a bit and to my delight A had drifted apart from N and A2 who had made new friends N had made friends with like half the school and was really popular he was friends with that rich kid from before too Most of my group disliked me by then too they thought I was weird and boringAt the end of 7th grade me and N argued a whole lot which gradually drove us apart and made us go from being "friends" and talking regularly to barely talking to eachother We still talked on snapchat a bit but that was about itIn 8th grade I became more confident and less awkward I also gained weight a bit to the point where I wouldn\'t break apart from a gust of wind Me and A talked a bit on skype and played games together though we never hung out or anything and I hung out with another friend that I had known from 6th grade F more I was still sort of being picked on and my acne had become worse but other than that I don\'t remember much else from 8th grade I had a fun time during the summer between 8th grade and 9th grade but I was still skinny had quite a bit of acne and was very awkward selfconcious and insecure# The Past YearThen 9th grade began and I was picked into a new group in which A and F were also picked though N and A2 were in another group I was now in a group with the vast majority of the "bad" students bad as in absolute dickheads and I began to skip school even more I got late to most of my classes and skipped a lot of others I was being picked on by other people now and in my spare time I began to work out and read as opposed to sitting in front of my computer Then out of absolutely fucking nowhere N and A2 called me and A on skype they convinced us to play Cards Against Humanity a card game featuring a metric fuckton of dark humor and we ended up having a fairly good time Me and the other guys began to become friends again and soon enough by october 2018 we were talking almost daily joking and talking a lot It got to the point where I was feeling really confident and wanted to ask A and N to go and hang out outside of school a few times but I never did because either they made some joke that would piss me off or I had problems in the family or I had a bad day at school or I flat out skipped school or the acne was especially badThen in november I skipped school several weeks in a row and my parents got angry at me for that and I never told them why because I was too insecure This rubbed off on me at school severely and I became more awkward again and now A and by december N and A were beginning to cut me out of skype calls again though this time they wouldn\'t add me in the first place Then at school A would tell me how much fun they were having and I would not tell him to shut up about it because I didn\'t want to lose the only friends I had By the end of 2018 my grades had gone down to the lowest they\'ve ever been and it was barely enough to get into any of the gymnasium the next school after 9th grade that I choseThen 2019 began and I continued to skip school because of the acne and in april N and A began to talk to me briefly again and over time I would continue talking to them They weren\'t as mean as before at all thankfully but I still couldn\'t bring myself to completely forgive them My grades went up a bit and I attended a bit more of school during May and June and yesterday I said goodbye to some of the people in my grade at the school ending not sure what the actual term is N said something along the lines of "I\'ll miss you buddy" when we said goodbye to which I didn\'t really have the time to respond to as he quickly moved on to say goodbye to someone else and then I went and said goodbye to the teachers before going home and celebrating with my family# The Past Few DaysEven though my "friends" were massive assholes during the past years I could tell that N had at least become less of one He wished me a happy birthday along with A though A sent a meme wishing me a happy birthday instead of actually saying anything I haven\'t talked to any of them since yesterday even though I kinda want to I feel really empty inside the past three years of my life feel completely wasted my friends are basically all gone my family all thinks I\'m kinda weird I think I\'m probably kinda weird I have gained quite a bit of weight and I eat a lot more but I\'m still skinny My acne is still there though it\'s been sort of fading out and I don\'t get a lot of pimples anymore it\'s mostly just marks littered throughout my face I hope it goes away soon enough A thing that I have to admit is that while my acne has been pretty bad it comes and goes and it\'s not even close to the worst degree of acne that you can have but it\'s still been bad enough that I feel ugly even though I generally consider myself to look pretty average and have skipped school over itI have no plans at all for the summer either which is another cause for me feeling empty Though at the end of the day I feel a lot more independent than before and I feel kind of hopeful for the future Whether I get into the gymnasium I wanted to or If I have to settle for another one that I chose it will be a new school with new people who don\'t know a single thing about me and hopefully I\'ll be able to make new friends there Until then though I\'ll have to endure my dad expecting me to go out and do stuff even though he should know by now that I won\'t my stepfather being condescending and all kinds of family crap I\'ve made promises to myself to continue to work out and gain weight to get rid of the acne that has essentially ruined my life and to make new friends once the summer break is over and to not skip my classes Sorry for the long as hell post but I had to get this off my chest as I haven\'t told anyone about this and I can\'t move on without writing this out of myself', 678754)
('The title of this post could probably suffice as an adequate TL;DR Now let\'s just hop into the specifics of this whole dealMy girlfriend let\'s refer to her as O and I began dating late October of last year As we were both seniors at that point in time this meant that we had started dating at the peak of the whole college application fiasco Even in the midst of this incredibly busy and stressful time college was something that still seemed incredibly far away for the both of us so there wasn\'t really much conversation regarding college you knowNaturally time goes on and we\'re progressing further into our relationship Feelings are getting deeper things are gradually getting all the more serious between usyou know the drill It was nearing the end of 2018 and at that point both O and I had heard back from all the schools that we had applied to Again college seemed super far and distant but receiving acceptance letters and no longer having to deal with the stress of actually applying kind of made college more of a reality than it had originally been One night O and I were hanging out and ended up actually discussing where exactly we had applied to as well as the schools that we were actually thinking about attending Between the two of us and around the ten to fifteen schools that we had each applied to there were only three that we had both applied to and out of those three there were only two schools that we considered actual options for the both of us You can probably see where this whole thing is goingThis particular conversation kind of acted as a reality check for me The two schools between us that we had considered actual choices were schools that I wasn\'t necessarily set on you know Just to make it more clear and less confusing let\'s refer to college A as being one that\'s out of state and college B one that\'s in state College A happened to be O\'s first choice whereas College B was more of a possibility for me due to the fact that I had gotten an amazing scholarship to go there So what I\'m saying is that even though there were two schools that we could\'ve both possibly ended up at together the chances of that were relatively slimHowever the conversation also kind of sparked a little bit of hope in me you know I want to make it clear though that I am not the type of person who would choose to go to a school purely for another person nor am I someone who would ever want someone else to choose a school purely for me I think that that\'s incredibly ridiculous My future is my future and their future is their future I want to attend a school that I believe will allow me to succeed and enable me to do exactly what I want to do and in regards to this situation I would want O to attend whatever college she feels is the best fit and whichever college she feels will get her to the places she wants to be No matter whatever decision she\'d end up making my support would be a given I mean that wholeheartedly But yeah despite all of that the conversation also had given me some hope Like wow what an incredibly wonderful maybe you know Things were going great then and I honestly didn\'t see things ending between us any time soon Possibly ending up at the same college could result in things continuing to go great you know So that was kind of my thought process at the timeAnyways 2019 comes and now the both of us are second semester seniors College was like a legit thing now It was becoming all the more real to me you know May 1st college decision day was closer than ever and even though it was only January a lot of people had already committed O and I\'s relationship had also been going absolutely amazing and at that point we were for sure in love I don\'t want to sound too cheesy or icky or cliche but yeah like I was for sure the happier than I had ever been You get the whole ideaSo one night O and I were hanging out with some friends from my school and things were going great Everyone\'s having a silly time it\'s a very relaxed setting And then this girl who I wasn\'t the biggest fan of not that that matters decides that right then and there would be an appropriate time to pop the question*"What are you two going to do if you end up going to different colleges Like probably break up right"*Talk about a mood killerNot gonna lie the question kind of pissed me off and had also caught both O and I off guard We hadn\'t even considered discussing it yet you know We kind of had this mutual unsaid agreement that we wouldn\'t worry about it until we needed to O and I kinda awkwardly laughed the question off and changed the subject but I was kind of in a mood for the rest of the nightYou see I just want to treasure the time that I get to spend with O I don\'t want to waste time being sad about something when it\'s literal months away Also I didn\'t know what was going to happen because hey maybe we\'d end up in the same place But that particular question just kind of made everything more real you know And it honestly put me in so much denial because once I had started thinking about it I couldn\'t stop O and I never had a conversation about it though and even though we didn\'t I am pretty sure we were both in the same boat at that pointMonths go on and I\'m starting to get more and more questions about the fate of O and I\'s relationship if we do end up going to different colleges Friends were asking me family members were asking meit honestly made me so upset and it was truly the type of thing that I couldn\'t like even discuss without getting super teary or anything like that you knowAt this point O and I had a random conversation about the status of our decision I told her that college A was off my list due to how expensive it was She told me that college B was off her list because she had visited and it didn\'t seem like a good fit for her This conversation was really casual and honestly it didn\'t have a melancholy tone or anything like I was honestly just incredibly happy for her about her two amazing choices and she was happy for me for my two So that\'s when the two maybes that we had disappeared And yeah like I said there was never really a sad moment that we like had shared together The real like shock and like sadness regarding that conversation came afterwards the same night when I was hanging out with a close friend and once again got that whole "are you two going to break up before college" question yet againFebruary and March seemed to pass real quick and during the month of April O was out of town for a couple of days to visit her two top colleges of choice I remember the night she got back and we were up in her room talking about how her whole trip went when she ended up telling me that she had actually committed to her top choice university which happens to be across the country Now when she told me I was literally nothing but happy Like fuck yeah you know I\'m super proud of my girlfriend Like man oh man I support that girl so so so very much and I genuinely feel nothing but absolute warmth when I think about her like doing what she wants to do and achieving the things that she wishes to achieveShortly after she committed I ended up committing to a private school in the state due to the fact that it has one of the best programs in the country for what I want to do Like it was an amazing opportunity that I couldn\'t pass up as I got a huge scholarship to there as well It\'s a university that\'s about 3045 minutes away from where I currently live and about 10 minutes away from where O lives As her parents both attended the university that I will be going to everyone in O\'s family is incredibly excited for me as well May went by incredibly quick and I ended up graduating on the 23rd and then had my grad party on the 24th O attended both of these events and was again nothing but supportive of the whole thing O and her twin brother had their grad party on the 30th and then they recently graduated on June 4th One night in between O\'s grad party and mine we were at her house and in her basement drinking and being all goofy with each other and whatnot Like when her and I drink together we play these stupid truth or drink question game and end up getting super deep and super honest as we progressively get drunker and drunker So we were laying on the couch cuddling and she mentioned how sometimes she thinks about this couple who went to her school are going to college together and how enticing that sounds to her I was kind of shocked because like we never really discussed the whole thing and I thought that that\'s where the conversation was headed We\'ve been dating for almost eight months now and I can understand how it can sound really ridiculous as we are both eighteen and young and stuff but wholeheartedly I\'ve never met anyone like her before Like I don\'t know how to exactly explain it but it just always feels like there\'s going to be more time with her Like I don\'t know at two months it was like yeah of course there\'s gonna be a four months and then at five months it was like yeah there\'s for sure gonna be a seven months you know And I can\'t like not picture us together I don\'t know Like she leaves August 9th and it\'s just like the idea of only having this month and then next month and then not making it to ten months is like really weird to wrap my head around and stuff I don\'t remember what I said but it was kind of just the tip of the iceberg you know I think I mentioned how all of my close friends are attending a state school like me and that she\'s truly the only person who I have to actually deal with leaving and how that\'s just going to absolutely devastate me Like I for sure could have said way more but like I don\'t know she started crying and I started kind of crying so like we just kind of left it at thatI think my point in writing this is that I feel insanely conflicted and kind of scared On one hand I\'m trying to keep the mindset of not worrying about the fate of our relationship until I have to I\'m trying so hard to spend as much time with her as I possibly can and treasure each and every single moment And so far I think that that\'s the best optionOn the other hand I feel like it\'s something we should at least maybe have a conversation about Like I just don\'t know how to bring it up though And like if we do talk about it and the general consensus is like a "yeah we need to break up" then that\'s gonna make the tone of the last couple months that I have with her different Like "why are we doing this if we know it\'s just gonna end anyways" type of vibe But at the same time like it could be worth it But also like I don\'t want our relationship to end prematurelyI completely understand that the relationship probably should and most likely will end before we head off to college I want my whole college experience and I want her to have her whole college experience without either of us holding the other person back But at the same time I just feel like the type of relationship that we have is so incredibly special and that she\'s truly the type of person to come around once in a lifetime you know And like maybe if it\'s meant to be then we will end up together after everything because that\'s for sure a possibility I just don\'t want her to be the good old "one who got away" And I always think about it and it\'s like fuck O I wish I had met you earlier because having someone like you has brought so much light into my life But at the same time it\'s like fuck I wish I had met you after everything was all figured out because there\'s no doubt in my mind that we would be something greatNow as for replies I don\'t really know what I\'m looking for I think advice and some input would be helpful but I\'d also be interested in others sharing their own experience with something like thisThanks for like listening/reading or whatever if you got this farAN ACTUAL TLDR: My girlfriend of almost 8 months and I are going to different colleges in different states and I don\'t really know if I should have the whole "are we gonna break up" convo yet or just like let it be and not worry about it until it needs to be worried about', 677494)
('What I am about to write to you is horrible It’s the worst thing I have ever done and the fact that I did makes me want to cry I am a horrible man and I am in the middle of restructuring myself to insure that nothing like this ever happens again There is adult content in this so be aware of that if you want to read I am looking for any kind of advice or just comments Hell you can even just roast me if you like I dated this girl who was younger than me and we hit it off well I don’t want to go into much detail into this now as you will hear more about this later She broke up with me early December and it was kinda what I wanted I did cry but I did not know why at the time We went our separate ways and I contacted her a week later telling here I am glade we meet and sorry for pushing you away She told me it’s okay and that she still thinks of me That was our last conversation I blocked her on Snapchat so I wouldn’t see any new boyfriend and I started to see other people A few weeks ago I met this girl from Colombia who was staying in SF for the weekend She really liked me and really wanted to hook up I’m not into hookups but she wanted to keep in touch on Instagram I hate social media and haven’t been on Instagram for about 40 weeks but I accepted her friend requested and we talked there a little That’s when I say the girl that broke up with me Eevee and something hit me I saw her Instagram account and I finally realized why I cried when she broke up with me It was because I loved her and I hid that from myself so that I could push her away It was very clear and these emotions flowed through my body that I had felt before I tried contacting her on Instagram “Hi Eevee I’m bored and snooping what’s up” Very bad first message but I just wanted to hash out these emotions and let her know how I felt at the time so that I could make sense out of everything for myself She didn’t respond and I was fine with that And then I got drunk on May 30th and I did the worst thing possible I went creep mode to the max I was thinking in my head that I was sick of seeing her face on my Instagram and I’m gonna get her to hate me and block me A great idea when your drunk right So out of no where this is hard for me to say Out of no where I send her a dick VIDEO of me Not a picture but a damn video you guys She responded with:“You can’t come back into my life because you are bored besides I have a boyfriend now lol”My response: “I don’t give a shit show him too”She then said okay and blocked me I regretted what I did instantly Still drunk I went onto Snapchat and said “You need to block me here as well because all I can do is think about how happy you made me and I don’t have the balls to do it myself” She read it and blocked meI woke up the next day feeling horrible and I need I had to be blocked everywhere cause I didn’t want her to hear my crap I text her with my new number explaining a few things saying I’m sorry and told her to block the number She did I saw her on my WhatsApp and told her to block me there I knew obsession was coming but it wasn’t the kind of obsession you are most likely thinking of I told all my friends what I did and how ashamed I was They told me I did a creepy thing but I am not a creep A creep wouldn’t feel bad or reflect on what he did I am just and idiot I still think I’m a big creep So the obsession starts My obsession was with an apology I needed to say sorry to her for what I did To do so I did something creepy I created a new Snapchat account and contacted her I sent a series of snaps with an apology and it went like this I called her by her real name but I’ll call her Eevee hereEevee this is Lawrence and this is my apology I am really sorry for what I did and you really didn’t need that I sexually harassed you and I promise you that I will never do that to you or anyone else ever again It’s the stupidest thing I ever done and I will never ask for your forgiveness I am sorry I want to tell you why I did what I did It’s not a good excuse at all but this is why When you left me I cried I didn’t understand why I cried but I did When I did bad things to people in the military I did not cry When my girlfriend of 8 years left me I did not cry So why did I cry when you left me I thought about it for awhile but then left it alone I went on and was with other women I blocked you in sc and you were out of my left I met a girl and she wanted to talk on Instagram and I saw you there Eevee It was like everything was clear It was because I loved you and I was hiding my feelings The way you used to look at me like I was important The way you made me felt I just bottled it up I tried to contact you and the way I tried was stupid I was fine that you didn’t respond I figured you were out living your life and you didn’t need to deal with me I was just going to figure it out on my own Then I got drunk and sent you that stupid thing I did Im so sorry Eevee And if you do have a boyfriend I hope he treats you better than I ever did I think left a message saying I’ll delete this new account tomorrow She opened all the snaps and read the messages but did not respond I then left one more message and I think this one was really stupid I said that I would love to have a second chance but it’s just wishful thinking That if she ever wanted to talk to me just unblock me somewhere and say hi If not good bye Eevee I will always remember you as the girl who thought me what true courage is I will now always show and tell my feelings even if it will hurt me That’s courage and I have been a coward my whole life She didn’t read this message after the snaps it was left unopened The next day came and I went to delete the account I couldn’t figure it out so I left a snap with a hand writing note sayingI can’t sleep at night knowing you are mad at me If you still have my amiibos burn them and send me their remains I can’t figure out how to delete this account so I will just never log again She opened the snap and then open the message She responded by saying:You owe me money for wasting my time like this smhI responded by saying you owe me money for lingering in my heart like you own the damn place  Do you still have my amiibosI am not sure if she read that message but she blocked me a day after she sent me the message I got my apology in so I’m not perusing her But I am sure you think I’m an idiot Comment and let me know', 674404)
('Its been a while since I have slowly but steadily been realizing how everyone around me doesn\'t actually care about my existence I used to have a best friend for almost 12 years and I completely cut him out of my life and don\'t feel anything I just realized that the whole time ever since we met was simply using me as a measuring tool I was always forced to compete with him which in turn helped him grow He would always manipulate the situation to put anything and everything into a competition or an argument and him being a very logical and binary person there was no gray Everything was black or white Eventually i got sick and tired of it and one day he went off on one of his moments and i just didn\'t even read the rest of the text i only read the notification on my phone and went and blocked him on the app I never blocked his number he could always if needed call me or text me He never did Its been over a year and a half&amp;#x200B;Before that my ex cheated on me We dated for 2 years and after getting raped on her college campus literally months after starting there and joining a sorority I stuck it out I believed that love existed and I loved her anyways no mater what happened and I dedicated a lot of time to making sure she had what she needed including regular "space" to recover She seemed to be recovering well until I caught her fucking another guy Logically I didn\'t do anything wrong it was her choice I of course was mad she was mad and we left in a bad way I eventually calmed down told her that whatever happened happened and that I wish her well She said she still loved me etc but its been months without her and I felt fine Between this break up and disconnecting from my friend about 3 years past&amp;#x200B;After I stopped speaking to my best friend who by the way dates my sister and visited regularly but now doesn\'t show up if I\'m home I also left my social circle of friends and my church I deleted snapchat and instagram which were my only two forms of social media except reddit of course Everyone had my number my pastor my friends everyone No on ever called or texted or asked where I disappeared I literally vanished Never said a word to anyone Eventually I got in touch with one of my closer friends from the group She said "oh we just figured you\'d moved on to better things for yourself" Seriously "We asked your friend and he said he doesn\'t know anything" Right This has been building for months&amp;#x200B;My new friend group and church is much smaller and more genuine in my opinion There are only 6 of us my age I am the oldest But as usual slowly the newness is wearing off and I\'m starting to realize that if I vanished no one would even notice again And its not like I don\'t do anything I love to help people I love to support people I don\'t count money when it comes to friends if they need it I don\'t act like a jerk maybe a little with my overly realistic new outlook on life I have steadily improved my quality of life over the years I\'m out of college and I\'m no longer sleeping at most 3 hours a night due to balancing work and clinicals I live almost 100% stress free I have started listening to calmer music and actually enjoy it I have developed many new skills and made myself 100% self sustainable even though I live with my parents I don\'t have a reason to move out just yet I pay rent and pull my weight in the family not counting a cent or a minute I invest into my aging parents and my up and coming sister &amp;#x200B;I don\'t want to say I am perfect I have had my fair share of mistakes and mental breakdowns and teenage suicidal thoughts But I worked through it all and used it as lessons to become a better me The only thing is why become a better me if no one cares I could seriously live on less than half my paycheck living with my parents and not even feel a difference I could just not read books or write poetry or do sports or listen to music or research stocks or build computers or a million other things I have learned to do well and nothing in my life would change I could get rid of all of my friends and family and NOTHING would change&amp;#x200B;Yeah I would have no social life but the current social life I have seems to be no different that the last or the one before that or the one in high school or the one in elementary school Its like everyone is still a freaking child living in their own bubble not caring about anyone else but themselves and maybe it does sound selfish but I want some one to care that isn\'t the internet because the internet does not fucking care There are 15 million people on this sub and this post will be less than a period on a piece of paper But I still want someone to just sit me down and get to know me understand me and what makes me let me cry it out and tell me that I could throw all my successes and failures away and I would still matter That human existence as a whole humanity matters&amp;#x200B;I have been reading [this]https://thoughtcatalogcom/hollyriordan/2018/11/readthiswhenyoufeellikenobodycares/ post several times a week now I am not suicidal I am too afraid to die or the pain of dying I also at least have enough self respect to not throw myself away like that just in case something ever comes along that needs my existence even if its for a minute&amp;#x200B;You may also say oh but your parents your family Seriously I am known as the failure of the family I had to claw my way out of so many holes My sister is the family angel she can do no wrong and she has a 40 in one of the top colleges in the country She is on track and everyone fusses over her I am not jealous I don\'t want people fussing over me and constantly pestering on how I am doing I just want the people I care about to care about me as well in the most real sense of that word &amp;#x200B;This makes no sense doesn\'t it', 673429)
('For some information I\'m early 20s M college student so I\'m relatively young and still like experimenting with life I\'m not looking for advice Just wanna get it r/offmychest Sorry if I break any rules first time posterSo it all starts when I was 16 when I had just lost my sister A week later at a summer camp I met the person who would end up being my 5th gf and person who would take my virginity But personally I sucked still do at long term relationships and we lived too far for two high school teens who couldnt drive So we broke it off Got back again the next year My college applications got in the way so we cut it off I get into my top choice I have a shitty rebound relationship Then i stay single for the next 3 years just trying to figure out why I couldn\'t get over this exShe on the otherhand starts dating someone else and brings him to the camp we first met It doesn\'t get to me but she obviously tries to hurt me with her new relationship I couldn\'t care because I consider her to be my past and we failed at our 2nd time around I pull some tricks like getting our friends to dare me to makeout with the new bf he was okay with it and stuff but as he left and the 2nd week with my ex at camp began everything just renewed again while I tried to keep it down I was literally going across the country to a school while I knew that when she graduated she was gonna stay in the same area she lived in Skipping some stuff where I finally try to and unsuccessfully let go of her and many tears and heartache over missing her while not accepting that was why I was crying we come to January 2018 where I have a dream about her and I meeting up she was single and we were at the place of our last date I come from a family where we believe in prophetic dreams and to never ignore them if they show you something So the next time I\'m home in early June 2018 I hit her up and ask if we can meet up We go to the area of our last date and she tells me her and the guy who came after me broke up in January I didn\'t know why but my heart just lit up at that I was confused but I kept my chill We caught up and she asked to take me to some local restaurant Halfway there she said verbatim "So i\'ve been hooking up with this guy and then i caught feels so I\'m seeing him now" Lemme just say that shit hurt It felt like a dagger was stabbed into my heart Then she twisted it by claiming the reason why we didnt work out was because of all the reasons I cited why we did work And she also made comparisons on how I was better than her current guy It all just hurt over and over and I spent the next month trying to forget her typical genz unfollow/unfriend on everythingSince then I tried getting back into dating my parent therefore I moved across the country closer to move in with her partner so now I have no reason to be close to my ex I met this wonderful person on tinder who surprisingly took interest in me and we were planning on starting a relationship but I was reluctant because I still felt confused over my ex I managed to push it to the back of my mind but at the end of May 2019 I came back to my old home and camp with my best friend and found out my ex was there too alumni things I felt like there would be a drunk hookup so I didnt feel like it would be right to make myself official with someone right before I was going away for sometimeWell at this camp the first night all of the younger alumni 1927 chose to get crossfaded me especially and while everyone else played party games me and my ex got tired and went away just to catch up She\'s single again many things happened this past year for her same for me When we get in privacy the first words she says is "I still use you as my basis for every relationship but no one has been better than you" All I could say is "Same goes for you"She said "I know I\'ll always love you"I said "Same for you You know how frustrating that can be"We end up hooking up It didnt feel like the closure I\'ve searched for for 3 years It more felt like a reawakening and realization of my feelings with the lens of these years of meditation on myself For those 4 nights she slept in my arms every night One night she said "You\'re the only one I could imagine spending my life with" I said "Same goes for you" I KNOW ANNOYING BUT I\'M TYPICALLY RESERVED WHEN IT COMES TO HERI honestly didn\'t know how to tell her that I was about to begin another relationship because I didnt want to see her heart break like she did with mine I tried to say I was afraid of the day I would break her heart and although she hurt me I never wanted to do the same And that night in my arms she said "Please don\'t talk like we will never happen again" With as much pain and love that I felt she could emoteShit hurt bad y\'all I didn\'t tell her When we parted ways we kissed and just never spoke But i can\'t get her out of my mind Nothing against my new partner she\'s amazing and she clings onto me and I like being with her but after so much meditation and thought I just know I\'ll never love her We did end up together but I just know that while it\'s summer this is temporary I can\'t and won\'t go back to my ex because of the country thing but i just don\'t know what to do about her I see her in a week because of an event that I\'m flying back to my hometown for but I don\'t know I\'m here to grow My current partner and I are helping each other grow and we will split when that time comes But I can\'t tell whether my thoughts are plagued by my exes words but I just feel like being with her was right but the time and place wasn\'t Ultimately for the past three years has been I\'m going to grow to become the best I can so when I find the person I want to spend my life with they can receive the best me and now that I have an idea for who that is we can both wait It\'s how I know we love each other We are waiting for each other to grow and I\'m just hoping that we end up in the same place one day in 5 years If that happens we can give it another shot If we are right we grow together and we really support each other through the future If not we will still grow but keep moving onThat\'s all I can hope for Maybe I\'m some blind stupid romantic and I refuse to take what is easy and in front of me but I\'d rather live my best life and see where I end upSorry for being a romantic college student', 668354)

(' Tl;dr: My best friend and I got in an argument over his ex he got mad enough to friend dump me and I’m really sad about it I met my best friend 7 years ago when we were both on an online dating site We lived too far away to date one another but kept in touch to trade first date horror stories and make fun of life in general We got really close really quickly I proofread his dissertation  He sent me care packages when I was pregnant Occasionally we’d flirt a little and admit we were jealous of the people we were dating Nothing ever happened it was just kind of a sweet friendship with the added bonus of there always being a little chemistry to keep things exciting About three years ago he met this woman and fell head over heels in love She was his physical ideal and  also the smartest funniest woman he had ever met She was also married and he dumped his girlfriend at the time to start an affair with this woman I was the only person he told and I wasn’t happy I tried to tell him several times I felt he was making a mistake that cheating never works out that I had a gut feeling she wasn’t trustworthy and that he was going to get hurt He didn’t want to hear it so we went  through some rough patches where we fought over this and didn’t talk for a coupe weeks at a time  Things were tense between us for a long time because I didn’t approve of his relationship and he didn’t want to quit seeing her Eventually they had a horrible breakup and my friend was devastated In the end I was completely right about her not being a good person and that things would end badly My friend had a horrible few months—cheated on dumped lost his job couldn’t find a new job quickly medical issues money problems—and on top of that he decided to discontinue his antidepressants until he got better insurance At this point my friend started getting really unstable He’d break down over everything make everything about his ex If I mentioned I had a sandwich for lunch he’d talk about how he made a sandwich for his ex the last time she came over And then he’d get upset and just disappear for a coupe days until I’d check on him He also had outbursts of anger toward anyone who disagreed with him about anything It was really hard to talk to him One day he mentioned how his ex was the most beautiful woman he’d ever seen and I made some joke like “Maybe if you like MySpace selfies and bad eyeliner” and he lost it on me Told me I was an arrogant asshole who tried to boss him around to avoid dealing with my own problems that I was an immature child that I lied all the time to myself and about our friendship and that I was a bully who harangued him into getting meds and therapy because I wanted to control him He told me not to contact him for a month or he’d let me know what he really thought about me and he could guarantee I’d be devastated I left him alone for several months actually and then sent him some photos from a trip to New York he and I were planning to take together He responded briefly and then didn’t answer any of my replies A few days later I took a photo of some bread I baked because we used to trade cooking stories all the time He responded again and then when silent Another week passed and I messaged that I’d be in his town in the summer and and wondered if he’d like to get a drink and talk some and he wrote back “No thanks” I finally emailed him to ask what the deal was that I wasn’t interested in fighting again but that I missed him and would always be willing to talk stuff out if he was willing too He wrote back “I responded to those two messages because you seemed sad and I didn’t want you to feel bad but we aren’t friends and we never will be I like you and I think highly of you but things ended in a way that makes me never want to interact with you again You’re part of the past now Not a bad past but history—gone”  I replied to say that I thought that was pretty shitty but that I would be around if he ever needed me and he didn’t respond It’s been three weeks since then and I still can’t get over it Our friendship was a huge deal to me and our big argument only happened because I made a joke about a woman who cheated on him and ghosted him when he was at his lowest I feel like a worthless unwanted person now and I’m afraid to interact with anyone for fear of saying the wrong thing and pissing them off too I wish I could get over it I’m a grown ass adult with a busy life but I spend the vast majority of my time thinking about what I could’ve done differently or how I can make things better Even if he would just admit he misses me half as much as I miss him that’d be something  Knowing he doesn’t think about me at all anymore really really hurts Thanks for letting me be sad here It’s embarrassing to talk about friend drama when you’re 30something and no one gets why you were friends in the first place', 666720)
('Yeah I\'m afraid&amp;#x200B;When I first found out about asexuality it was the most amazing sigh of relief in the world For so long I always thought there was something deeply wrong with me I always wondered as to why I was so weird compared to everyone else \'Why am I so different and weird in comparsion to everyone\' is what I used to always say &amp;#x200B;I used to say that perhaps I was born in the wrong time or something I always felt like some sort of abnormal freak or loser in comparison to everyone else Everyone else seemed to have it so easy to go out and talk to people or interact with others and I never felt like I ever fit in with anyone People would always be talking about parties or going out to some new spot they would be going out to Myself personally I was the complete opposite of everybody I was a reclusive hermit all throughout school&amp;#x200B;On Friday nights I was doing school and still doing school as well while watching politics or game shows I would be finishing a paper for school in the campus library or reading and listening to music on my laptop I did those sort of things I was not a social person Social environments tend to honestly make me nervous on one end and isolated on the other endparties especially &amp;#x200B;I just could never do parties I didn\'t like the setup the people all around you conversations planning food you name it I just can\'t do parties Most parties just leave me as the wallflower to be perfectly honest with you Mostly everybody is out there drinking smoking whathaveyou I don\'t look to judge but I simply just don\'t want to drink or smoke Then whenever somebody starts introducing sex to the equation that\'s when I feel really left out Whenever someone starts mentioning what they did over the weekend or what kind of lifestyle they lead in terms of what they do sexually that\'s when I feel I don\'t belong anymore Things simply stop making any sense whatsoever and I feel like I\'m the only one who isn\'t in the game per se I feel like an outsider though I\'m physically present there &amp;#x200B;That\'s why I probably haven\'t been to a party in the last 8 years or so That\'s probably why I\'m the only ace person in the world that has basically little to no solid friends whatsoever Most of the people I talk to are on the internet I think this is where I congregate easiest and find most comfort in talking with others Real life interactions are a bit more difficult for me sad to say&amp;#x200B;I know that for the ace community we have openly tried to display a normalcy with asexuality so that we\'re not pathologized for our lack of desire in terms of sex However I know for the life of me that I\'m not the perfect role model to display what a *normal ace* is supposed to look like&amp;#x200B;Yeah so I know I\'m not the social butterfly or the beautiful swan like Hans Christian Andersen portrayed it to be I\'m more of that ugly awkward duckling that somehow waddles without falling down I guess Awkward\'s putting it mildly to be perfectly honest I have more conversations out loud with myself than with other people I\'m sure a lot of people look at me when I do that and go *\'"Wow he is surely a weird guy He talks to himself He\'s crazy"*\'&amp;#x200B;So yeah I\'m a weird guy and my asexuality only adds on top of the weirdness and awkwardness of me It would have helped to have known about asexuality all throughout those very dark and depressing years when I felt like a reject and a weirdo High school was weird with everybody trying to go out and have sex all the time with others I felt like an observer most days wondering what the heck is going on with everybody else that I don\'t understand I had two classmates in high school get pregnant and I simply didn\'t understand what the heck happened I was trying to be on my onetrack to college and here everyone is out here trying to have sex I simply didn\'t get it or get any of this stuff It was a complete loss for me I was just glad to get through with high school and move on to college I figured that high school was just weird&amp;#x200B;Then it turned out I was wrong: ***I*** was weird and atypical Apparently it seemed everyone else was all about having sex and I simply was the oddmanout scenario The local bars and nightclubs were apparently the Thursday Friday and Saturday hangout spot It was where you could apparently do the mating dances and be the bird of paradise all the while I never went to those places better yet didn\'t want to Those places just weren\'t for me It may seem like the thing to go to those places but I never wanted to Whether it because I don\'t drink or was it because I don\'t have sex I can\'t tell you I can just openly tell you this: I was happier not doing those things than being forced to do them That I\'ll say for the double echo ^echo echo&amp;#x200B;I honestly don\'t get the whole idea as to why for one to be fun one must drink and party I don\'t drink or do drugs and I still think I\'m fun I have a lot of fun and ebullience even though it may be only with myself since I really don\'t have many friends However I think I have a great time and live it up as a sober person so I don\'t see why it\'s such a big deal as to why I don\'t drink or anything&amp;#x200B;I also don\'t get why it\'s such a big deal as to why *I* have to have sex I simply don\'t get it Why everyone seems to think you\'re an anomaly of sorts because you don\'t have sex is crazy to me I don\'t know why people are so obsessed with sex to the point they arrogate you to do it It\'s beyond my comprehension I also don\'t get why so many people overall think that sex is a fundamental requirement of every human Surely sex can\'t be a universal thing There have been cases of individuals who have lived without having sex right So sex isn\'t for everybody obviously Why can\'t I be one of those people then&amp;#x200B;It boggles me to no end how society automatically says that those who don\'t have sex are somehow pathologically broken *Thank you 40 yearold virgin for reinforcing the stereotype* I don\'t get how not having sex means you\'re doing something wrong or you are abnormal I don\'t get that For me not having sex is normal for me I am living the way I\'m supposed to live being abstinent *not sure what the right word is here* &amp;#x200B;Sex is not something I ever agreed to do or wanted to do It\'s not like I signed a contract with ink on it stating I must have sex before 2043 or something There isn\'t a contract unless I was under anaesthesia when I signed it I doubt that happened So why does society feel its need to tighten the screws in to make me do it That I don\'t comprehend&amp;#x200B;I don\'t get why it\'s so ***bad*** to be a virgin I don\'t get all the virgin stereotypes and assumptions really the angry incel the prude nun the awkward dork the baby supernerd the purity ringer I don\'t get why so many look at virgins through a horribly tinted lens I don\'t know &amp;#x200B;Now I am awkward and I am a nerd who has never even held hands with another human being before despite having kissed once or twice many moons ago and I mean *many*  However I don\'t see that as an overall problem really and I don\'t understand why others *do* &amp;#x200B;I don\'t get the devaluing of those who don\'t have sex and inversely them devaluing themselves to low selfesteem The amount of posts I\'ve seen on reddit alone tells me there\'s something I\'m not getting with all of this &amp;#x200B;Why do people think virgins are losers Aren\'t virgins people too Or are they subhuman I\'ve heard people say that it\'s a major red flag or a turnoff when they hear their partner is still a virgin at age 30 40 50 I don\'t get that at all The first thing that comes to mind for me *"Welcome to the Virgin Club We\'re a party of two"* I guess *that\'s* the party I can join in I don\'t see anything about it If the person is nice and wants to be my friend and values/loves me as a person that\'s all I need to know at the end of the day Those things are more valuable to me than something the human body can give me&amp;#x200B;It seems we assume a whole lot of things about a human being just because they have not decided to engage genitally in some way I don\'t know I guess it comes back to that *"Sex is the grand pantheon"* thing that I spoke about earlier on Since sex isn\'t the end all be all for me I guess it shouldn\'t be a surprise that the sexual society is something I find highly peculiar really It\'s still the same weird to me anyhoo I\'ve tried to understand it but I simply can\'t&amp;#x200B;The tying of being a man or a woman by how much sex one supposedly gets is incredibly beyond me Now maybe that\'s because I\'m a virgin I say that After all so many people love to instantly tell me that \'"*How can you know you don\'t like sex You\'ve never even tried it"\'* So maybe I truly can\'t see what everyone else sees Maybe I\'m the one who\'s wrong and they\'re truly right I don\'t know the answer to that I am that really awkward duckling still so maybe I am the weird kid who does need fixing I don\'t know &amp;#x200B; *I simply never understood what sex is or how you even do it for that matter another thing in the long line of things I just don\'t get*&amp;#x200B;However I know what\'s not broken about me I believe I\'m a nice person or I can be I guess &amp;#x200B;*I guess a nice person wouldn\'t really have to brag about being nice would they*&amp;#x200B;Anyway I love to sing I love to exercise I love to play I love to learn new facts I think I pursue knowledge I love trivia I love history I love to write I love music I love a whole host of things I don\'t think I\'m short on love really I love oodles and oodles of things So what\'s so weird about me again&amp;#x200B;Just how I feel I\'m just getting some stuff of my chest My apologies for being verbose &amp;#x200B;***tl:dr I am asexual and I\'m weird I don\'t see what\'s wrong with that***', 659700)

("I'm writing this here in hopes of getting some advice or at least words of encouragement and prayer My wife and I always had the same plans We wanted a big family with at least 4 children and we wanted to raise them in our southern hometown We struggled to get pregnant for five years and since our pastor advised against medically supported conception we were about to turn to adoption when we finally had a baby Our son was the center of our world and the goal was to make a decent human being out of him That decency always meant faith good education strong family values and ultimately love for us and the family he creates It was the path we had intended for our son and he has happily or so we thought followed it for many yearsWe noticed last year that he wasn't his usual extroverted happy positive self He had mood swings he spent a lot of time in his room he stopped going to Bible study and eventually he stopped going to Church all together My wife and I would pray for him daily and we asked our Church community to pray for him too I decided to give him some time to figure things out on his own but my wife is a very intense woman She's always been a good wife and a good mother but throughout the years she became somewhat of a control freak fixated on perfection She couldn't have the ideal family she always wanted so she tried to create perfection with what she had She would lecture our son daily yell at him and even threaten him that his soul will be damned if he doesn't come back to God She kept pressuring him when finally on January 7th he yelled back at her and told us that he was gay He actually screamed it out started crying and went out I went to my office and my wife went to our bedroom to pray He came home after midnight and the three of us sat down to talk Before he could say anything my wife said that he mustn't tell anyone Her plan was for him to graduate high school and then send him to a conversion camp before he started college in fall She told him that he has to return to God and our Church and no matter what he isn't allowed to act on his feelings and get physical with another man Things have been so bad ever since that I don't think my marriage can be saved I was also raised in a conservative Christian environment and hearing those words come out of my son's mouth wasn't easy I could feel my heart breaking but not for a second did I feel the disgust and shame my wife says she feels daily My journey of fully accepting the life my son needs to live in order to be happy will be a long one But I'm willing to do it I talk to him now more than I ever have before we talk about everything from the moment he realized that he was gay to making sure he understands how to protect himself mentally and physically from all of the danger that he may encounter I found a lot of online support groups and in one of them I read about a movie Prayers for Bobby I decided to see it with my wife it helped me put things in perspective and acknowledge the love I have for my boy but my wife said that Bobby found salvation in his death My wife would rather have a dead son than an alive gay son And after he made it known that he won't go to a conversion camp it's almost like my wife disowned him She completely isolated herself from the two of us A few days after our son came out to us she decided to stop having sex with me so she could purify her soul She started saying that God doesn't want us to enjoy sex that it should be an act performed in hopes of conception and since we can't do that we mustn't let our sinful desire get the best of us She told him that unless he decides to go to a conversion camp in July once he's off to college he won't have a home to return to I kept trying to balance my relationship with her and my relationship with my son hoping that she would come around But a few weeks ago on the day of our son's graduation she was still in her pajamas when it was time to go She proudly said that he is no son of hers until he becomes a child of God again I took him our for lunch after graduation and we talked about a lot of things Witnessing my son feeling hated and abandoned by his own mother the same one who spent years in prayer so she could birth and love a child was the hardest thing ever He told me that he wanted to start going to Church again but not to our local Church known for being very strict instead he found a Church that's around 70 minutes away and it's known for being LGBTQ+ friendly He's visited a few times ever since and I can tell that it's making him feel better He has more understanding of what healthy tolerant relationships with his loved ones should be like after he comes out I'm especially happy that he didn't lose his faith he just couldn't listen to a man preaching about love knowing that the same man would shame him for simply being who he is He started talking about coming out to his grandparents and the rest of our family before he leaves for college I understand him he doesn't want to hide himself or any possible love interests he will have in the future but now I feel a lot of pressure I feel like it's my time to choose my son or my wife I keep telling myself that maybe she needs more time it's only been 6 months and she'll come around but every day she says something that makes me think she will never accept him She has become so bitter and angry and it's only a matter of time before the burden of her prejudice becomes too much for me to carry I still love my wife I don't mind not having sex with her for months I am able to forgive her for the words she has said but if her hate separates us to the point of no return I will stand with my son I just wish someone could give me advice that could help me change her mind with the little time we have before it's too late", 654676)
("It was years ago now but during the 2016 election the tension of the whole political atmosphere and my less than stellar parents lead me to loose someone so unbelievably precious to me Yet by my current friend's observations and my significant other's observations I was better off losing her But I just can't bear the fact that I was also less than good to her tooWhat had happened was that at I'd entered more than one debate with her and at the time you could consider me obsessively politicalI'd argue even if I didn't know what was going on and I'd be deeply hurt if it in any way shape or from revolved around my ideals Which Alot of the time was just because I was too scared to tell her these things were touchy for me Alot of the time she'd do it literally just to play devil's advocateI came home crying repeatedly because of our debates which were frequent among *everyone* in 2016 My parents have a history of trying to control who I was around and have gone through my trash and phone before to monitor things I may want to hide The only thing I've hidden from them was the fact I like girls and guys That's it You can imagine the absolute shit show that happened when they found out I was bi Anyway more to the point these debates started happening they were quick to call her racist and that broke me Because on one hand I knew I *knew* that wasn't true When the refugee crisis was at its peak in the news cycle we disagreed on letting them into the country or not She feared an attack on the country and I wanted to help those in need She was never against sending aid or anything like that She just had a priority that was diffrent to mine One I still would disagree with but not one that I'd be willing to call someome racist overOn the other hand things had gotten so tense and painful between us I felt confused and like I didn't know what was actually happening in the worldWhen she found out at school and realized I couldn't defend her and disagree with my parents about her being racist she finally cut things off with me But that was just the last straw My parents had been encouraging me to draw away from my old friends more and more and didn't relent upon their scrutiny over them This had been building up over months It was something I'd been torn about because on one hand I was the baby of the group I'd be exculded from 'mature' jokes not because of my age but because of my perceived innocence It was frusterating to be a high school student who would be coddled by her peers because of this yet also talked down to If I was teased and I teased back I'd be pulled aside and told to watch what I said This felt awful on account I never went over the lines they had established with their humor I'd always felt that I was just defending myself from their own hurtful remarksAlmost right before anything regarding our drift apart happened I told her I had a crush on her and was promptly rejected I need to point out I was okay and fine with this Heartbroken sure but generally happy to still be around my dear friend I *did* however try to back off She was questioning at the time I think and I really didn't want to intrude on that or pressure her When the last argument I had with her happened she snapped She brought up that I was a spineless coward That she'd never met someone she'd have to walk on eggshells over to talk to That she was heartbroken I'd stopped talking to her as much after she rejected me That she was glad we'd met but she'd prefer not to be my friend anymore I can't bear I let any of that happen It was so long ago for me and I know I'm probably just a figment in the back of her head now But I wish more than anything I could let her know how sorry I am that I made her feel like she couldn't talk openly with me That I'm sorry I didn't defend her against my parents remarks That I'm sorry I drifted from her after her rejection That I'm sorry I was so agressive with our arguments That I'm sorry if I ever hurt her in any way I wish I could let her know all of that and more But I have a new love and a new life and I know she does too I fear that if I try to contact her all she'll see is the same little girl who was in way over her head Or worse that I'll come off as desperate I don't want to bring back old memories for her but sometimes just sometimes I can't help but cry all over again for it I hope now maybe I can let it go Fresh starts and all that Here's hoping", 653462)
('Around this time last year i was working in a warehouse I had been at this job for roughly a year an half and was enjoying it for the most part It was a night shift position so the pay was well and i was used to those hours so it worked out I never cared about doing hard physical labor since i was never really good in school i knew id be doing it for life One morning as i was getting off work i just parked my machine and was walking to our lockers The walk back is decently long considering the warehouse is over 1million sq ft On my way i was talking with another co worker and not really paying attention to where i was going  Without realizing i walked into a pile of pallets and bumped my shin I didnt think much of this only that i was stupid A few days go on and i have a little bump on the upper part of my tibia My family/friends all just told me its a bone bruise and it takes awhile for that to go away Now a few weeks go by and the pain is slightly getting worse but the bump hasn’t gotten any bigger just more fragile to touch I then try to ignore the pain in hopes that its healing slowly I drag out a few more weeks of discomfort and had taking a lot of vacation time since I’ve been with the company for 18 months and never taken a day off I enjoy my time off i went to a festival and had a trip planned to Georgia at the end of the month with some friend to meet our online friendsBut a week or two after the festival i woke up and couldn’t walk on my right leg anymore I then realize this is a lot more serious than i initially thought I then decide to go to the hospital and get this checked out before our trip Also this is my first “vacation” if you would call it that since i was 15 So my mom drives me to the hospital to get some Xrays done and see whats going on We wait a total of 8 hours and finally get my images back to have the doctor tell me he has no idea what this is On the Xrays you could see this enormous black hole in my upper tibia with hairline cracks all around it He then wonders how I’ve been walking on this bone and dealing with the pain I tell him I’ve just tried to ignore it but it just got worse He prescribes me painkillers and tells me to get an MRI asap But with this trip coming up in 2 days i said i will wait till i get back which was only a 3 day thing I spend the whole vacation on awful crutches and a wheelchair and was miserable for the most part  Come Monday i get back from Georgia  my parents are out of town for 2 weeks on a trip they planned months ago and its just me and my younger brother I then go to my appointment and get an MRI done I have this younger female who likes to just assume things I get my images back and she sits me down to tell me i have this tumor inside my leg that is massive and trying to escape my bone She then tells me that my life isn’t really looking good at all she explains to me thats is very serious and more than likely will lose my leg I was left speechless as i thought they were going to say literally anything else She asks me if i want her to talk to my parents and them being on vacation i didn’t really want to ruin their time So i have her call my grandma and explain whats going on and shes freaking out The lady then tell my grandma after she asks what could have cause this and she says “shit luck” i kid you not I grab my phone and proceed to go home My grandma told my parents and they were devastated and decided to come back home immediately  Im glad they did cause i waited a week an half before seeing a real oncologist and i came to acceptance of losing my leg But knowing i was going to slowly die of something i had no control of and everyone around me would suffer too made me absolutely miserable So i see this  oncologist who after 2 minutes of looking at my leg told me were going to do a biopsy of this tomorrow morning and ill tell you the following day He said he knew it probably was cancer but their is always a chance its malignant The last thing he wants is for people to overthink an worry After the biopsy he tells me i have a high grade osteosarcoma He thens schedules me for surgery the following week to get this out since the cancer was trying to spread He was surprised i didn’t shatter my bone already given how big the tumor was and that i was walking on my leg for weeks But he said if i were to break it i would’ve  lost my leg and the cancer could’ve gotten lot worse Day of my surgery I’m having majority of my tibia removed with lasers then given a cadaver as a replacement I will also have a skin graft 2 plates and 14 screws as well as a part of my calf cut and placed on top of my shin as a shield/cast The surgeries  was a total of 8 hours done by a plastic surgeononcologist and some robots Now I’m out of surgery and in recovery for the next 6 days I had my own private room which was nice and most of it was a blur but i remember having 9 catheters and when they’d tend to my skin graft It was as if someone came in everyday to pull a scab just enough to where they’d could come back and be able to do it again Last day at the hospital im finally able to get out of bed but cant keep my leg down for more than 30 seconds I finally leave the hospital on the 28th of august and the 29th is my birthday The last place i wanted to spend my 22nd birthday After an hour in the back of a sedan with my leg up i was over it and just wanted to be home We finally get there and i live in the basement of my parents room I had planned on moving but with such events i decided not to This room i live in has no windows and I’ve been down here for 10 years At first it was cool as a kid but soon becomes very depressing Its 2 flights of stairs down but since i could only keep my leg down for 30 seconds it would take 20+ minutes to get there I couldn’t put my leg down rest for a minute and go again they told me roughly 1015 minutes between each session Finally in my room and i had just had a pc built and got my room setup to be stuck in for the next few months I was roughly taking 15+ pills a day all for different things But not getting addicted to opiates your steadily on every 46 hours for months is very hard Im not a pill person by any means and tend to just stay to marijuana But dabbing didn’t help as much with the pain as the opiates did and i tried really hard lmao 2 months out of surgery and I’m able to keep my foot down for 2 minutes at a time now and would be starting chemo and radiation very shortly With this happening the healing process of my leg would practically stop until treatment was over and was expected a 612 month recovery without any problems My chemo treatment was very aggressive since my cancer was and i spent 3 days a week 8 hours a day getting chemo treatments This was a 3 day on 18 days off thing Unfortunately once i started to feel okay it was time for the next treatment With having my leg restrictions as well i couldn’t really move during chemo and would just pee in a jug thing they’d give me This went on from mid October till the end of January After chemo was done i started radiation for 9 and a half weeks That wasn’t so bad except my mom would have to take off work to drive me an hour away to get 10 minutes of radiation and then drive back I didn’t mind being bald or even not having eyebrows but the eyelashes messed me up Everything gets in your eyes and you look like a completely different person I never took any photos of me like that I could look in a mirror but i seen no point in having a picture of me in that state Now i have hair everywhere except my one leg and I’m using a cane now so I’m getting close to walking I still have a bout a year from now till i can run/jump and do physical sports but i kind of just gave that up I want a real vacation this time but have no idea what to do I don’t have a job but i have plenty of money to spend  I saved a good amount at my job not taking off and working overtime as much as i could Its been a long 10 months and i cant wait to be normal again But if i were to ever break this bone the chances of it healing are slim and may need amputation With that hard labor jobs are kind of out of the question and with my plans of doing that my whole life I’m kind of lost on what i should do Anyways i thought id share this and if you have any questions or anything id be happy to answer them at this point I’m open to any type of question nothing will offend/embarrass  me', 653380)

('I\'ll start by saying this: I\'ve never had a very close relationship with most of my family members For whatever reasons my immediate family mom dad brother just never really kept in contact with many of our family members and it has also been vice versa &amp;#x200B;Now let\'s get to the "good stuff &amp;#x200B;I am 30 years old and I have still been living with my parents Yes I know this is a problem and yes I am doing everything I can to change it My brother has a history of being very mean aggressive and verbally abusive and even has sometimes gotten violent towards my mom and dad and I We have lived with this for years and all the while he has gotten the same treatment/opportunities that I have gotten and I have never acted in these ways or acted entitled like he does &amp;#x200B;Earlier this year in January my mom suddenly had a heart attack while out sight seeing with my dad and ended up in the hospital in a coma for a week before she passed away This has undoubtedly changed my life and left me with emotional scars The last time I ever talked to my mother she was laying in a hospital bed unable to respond and I was breaking down in tears&amp;#x200B;Fast forward a bit and we have family over at our house and many family members that we haven\'t spoken to in years for various reasons They visit for awhile and we have various other visitors who pay their respects and eventually my dad and I return to our "normal" life my brother is living on his own with his girlfriend We continue this way for a few months and visit one of my Aunts on my dad\'s side every weekend &amp;#x200B;My Aunt is one of those family members that hasn\'t been in our lives in years She abandoned us and shunned us for many many years because we do not believe the way she does and did not go to the same church as her She\'s a "Christian" Anyway we have been speaking again since her church basically black listed her and shunned her coming full circle for how she treated us Karma in action if you will &amp;#x200B;Something that happened before my mom died is I ended up being hospitalized for hearing voices and seeing visions I was in there for almost 2 weeks I even lost my job because of it I got out and returned to pretty much normal before all of this happened and my mom died etc I even got another job But once my mom died dad quickly found a new girlfriend in the form of a woman he had dated before he and my mom met There\'s even the story that mom caught him talking to her once around 10 years or so ago and claimed that he had been cheating They had talked about divorcing but never did ultimately &amp;#x200B;In less than 2 months after my mom died my dad is with this woman again I find this a little suspicious and it makes me question whether he truly cared about my mom That\'s a little quick to find someone for not having been talking to them already Fast forward a little and I\'m visiting my aunt again one weekend with my dad and they end up taking me to the hospital and admitting me AGAIN just because I was "acting weird" They did this against my will I did not give them permission to do so So guess what happens&amp;#x200B;I lose my job AGAIN and I have another week and a half stay in the hospital wondering why I\'m in there On the DAY i get released from the hospital my dad proclaims to me that we\'re moving in with my Aunt in 2 weeks I ask him how long he had been thinking about it and he said that he had been thinking about it on and off for a month BUT WAITS TO TELL ME ON THE DAY I GET RELEASED FROM A STRESSFUL HOSPITAL STAY&amp;#x200B;So 2 weeks pass and we move in with my Aunt He stays here with us for all of 2 weeks before moving in with his girlfriend which is where he currently resides My dad SCREWED me by doing what he did My plan was to get my old job back the one I had before i was hospitalized the first time and get my own place Then mom died He claimed that we would stick together but in reality he went for what he wanted his new girlfriend and said "Fuck you son fend for yourself" He did not state this explicitly but his actions spoke for themselves &amp;#x200B;Now here I am living with my aunt dealing with the depression and the emotional trauma of losing my mom The awkwardness of seeing him and his girlfriend interact with each other and flirt on Facebook I\'m also losing all the money that I had saved up for myself from not working and to add to that I\'m expected to pay roughly $400 a month rent to my Aunt My only income for the foreseeable future will be unemployment benefits I\'m at a low point for sure and I\'m now with left with some tough questions about my mom and dad\'s relationship and also of who I can truly trust now&amp;#x200B;Anyway I\'m saying this to give some background and insight on what I\'m really making this post about&amp;#x200B;I mentioned that my brother has a mean spirited aggressive and sometimes violent history Well I spoke to him recently about how awkward it is for me to be around dad and his new girlfriend and vented a little My brother being the mean spirited asshole that he is told me that he had been planning on "letting dad have it" for awhile now anyway So he goes and sends my dad many text messages blessing him out and calling him all sorts of mean nasty things and accusing him of never being a good father and also calls his girlfriend a "whore" &amp;#x200B;I go on after my brother tells me that he "let dad have it" and just go about living my life and I think nothing else of it It would do me no good to get involved and try to get mad and argue with my brother over what he did After all it was directed at my dad and he should be the one to handle [it]https://itDad Dad has enabled my brother\'s entitled behavior for years and never stood up to him and practiced tough love with him so dad essentially allowed mom and I to endure many many hardships and emotional trauma For example my brother would often call my mom a "bitch" and hold his fists up at her as if her wanted to hit her &amp;#x200B;Then the trouble starts Dad vents to my Aunt that my brother blessed him out and that\'s how she finds out that I said something to my brother about my dad and his girlfriend being over here visiting us She accuses me of "stirring the shit" and blames me for my brother going off on my dad the way he did and calling "her friend a whore" She then goes on to say that she doesn\'t want my brother showing up at her doorstep implying that because I\'m talking to him that he would show up here and cause trouble She also goes on to say that she doesn\'t want anything but peace in her house again implying that what transpired somehow took place in her house which I live in &amp;#x200B;When I stood up for myself she started naming off other people I could go live with and then made it a point to mention that my uncle wouldn\'t take me in She even said that if I need to be right then it\'s ok I can be right Very ironically for someone who wants peace in her house and doesn\'t want the "shit stirred" she seems to have a unique way of both "stirring the shit" and breaking the peace Her logic is so far skewed that she actually believed that her argument was valid She actually believes that it is my fault that my brother went off on my dad like he did and that it\'s my fault that he also called his girlfriend a "whore"&amp;#x200B;In reality she\'s just starting to get a taste of what my dad and I have endured for years with my brother and she doesn\'t know how to handle it What she really did by blaming me for my brother\'s actions is what my dad has done for years and that is she excused his actions as if they wouldn\'t have happened without me speaking to him and completely cleared him of responsibility for them I do believe that she is genuinely afraid of what my brother might do if he were to show up here In an odd and very eye opening way maybe that needs to happen so she can have a better idea of who to blame next time the "shit gets stirred" &amp;#x200B;I\'m posting all of this to get it off my chest and to vent I am very angry with her for even acting like she can judge the situation in the way that she is and for blaming me when it was clearly not my fault She was out of our lives for many years for her judgmental and "holier than thou" attitude Now she\'s back in our lives and wants to assess a stake in a situation that she has no stake in She\'s already found out what happens when you confront me with drama and petty schoolyard bullshit that is completely uncalled for and she was both shocked and surprised &amp;#x200B;It\'s funny she\'s over 50 years old and still a drama queen Just another example that proves age doesn\'t determine your maturity level She still worries about who says what about her and even contemplates and assumes what people might think about her or certain situations Sad really &amp;#x200B;My plan is to get my old job back still and get my own place After that I am feeling strongly that I need to cut ties with her and go back to the way things were no communication between us She seems to be the type to start drama and I no longer feel comfortable living her and especially talking to her about family matters Not only her but my uncle and even my cousin who is too young to even fully understand what is going on I even feel that it would be beneficial to keep communication with my dad to a minimum and also cut ties with everyone else on his side of the family since I don\'t exactly have good vibes from them either &amp;#x200B;To anyone who has read this far I thank you for paying attention and welcome any and all comments What do you think Would you cut ties too if you had been put through these situations', 651739)
("5/28/2019It wasn't an accident that I was where I was this morning I planned to be there because I had it on good authority that you could be found there every morning at that timeI will also admit that I sorted through my clothes and put on an outfit I thought you'd find to be nice; not too flashy but appropriate classic 'me' yet something you'd likely find attractiveI took into account that you may not recognize me at first glance so I made sure that the white camisole I picked showed my tattoo as I knew you'd know the view of the ink above my shoulder blades quite wellEven though my cutoff jeans were 10 full sizes smaller than the ones I wore the last time you'd seen me wear cutoffs in a natural setting they paired flawlessly with the cami and the same taletell pair of Justins that I've worn for going on five years now Those boots have lived through quite a few of our favorite times together and will always be like second skin to meI'll admit that I put effort into applying a light coat of make up as I wanted to compliment the natural features on my face and maybe take away from the parts I've become increasingly self conscious about since I last had you in my life to tell me how you think I'm beautifulI'll admit that when I realized it had taken longer than I'd expected to get ready I sped down those back country roads to ensure I would be at that place 'around the time' I'd been told you were usually thereI'll admit that as I approached the turnIn for the parking lot I felt like my heart was going to beat right out of my chest with anticipationI'll admit that when I searched every face and body of every man who was at that location even though the adrenaline was pumping I was bummed but also a little relieved when I didn't see youI'll admit that I didn't need gas but I parked at a gas pump I didn't have any desire for the coffee they served but I used it as an excuse to go inside and look around to check and see if you were insideBut you were not So I took my time I figured I'd use that as an opportunity to gather my druthers get my head together get a cup of coffee anyway and figure out what I was going to do with the rest of my dayI paid for my coffee the Middle Eastern Lady was very sweet as she gave me a humble smile when she handed me my change as if she could tell that there was a host of emotion waging a war inside of my thoughtsI carefully turned to my left placed my hand on the door to open it when I saw that bronzecolored vehicle one that I had seen once before late that night across town that one night pull into the lot in front of me causing the battle that was waging inside of my head to come to a dead heat and alternatively all functions within my body to come to a completeStop'Breathe' I told myselfI'll admit I forgot to breathe'What's that sound' I recall thinking 'it's so loud And annoyingly repetitive' reflecting upon how I loathe repetitive noises'Oh yeahthat's the sound of my own heartbeatwhoaI wonder if that's' I thought as the vehicle approached towards the building towards where my car was parked viewable from the rear unmistakably identifiable to anyone who knows me let alone the select few 3 who have ever considered it their property then turned to its left showing a clear view of the driver one of the select 3of you*gasp*That annoying repetitive sound was goneMy breath was goneThe feeling in my hands was goneMy ability to hear anything was goneMy ability to brain was goneIt's as if someone pressed the 'mute' button on ALL of my sensesThe silence was deafeningThen slowly the volume to all of my senses began to return all at once and the rush of the overcrowding was so intense and immediate that it was almost overwhelmingIn the almostyear it has been since you have been back 'in town' I have searched the faces of every crowd every car every line at the grocery store halfhoping I would see your face stand out The other half of me has feared the possibility of seeing you feared you seeing me and dismissing me feared you rejecting me all over againWorse yet I have feared the possibility of looking at you but not recognizing it was youBut you got out of the vehicle and started talking to the coworkers that I was told you are usually with and from the inside of the glass door unbeknownst to you I stood for a moment watching you andI'll admit I was SO glad to see you I've missed you so much Your body may have changed a bit the fur on your face a bit longer the hair on your head a bit unruly in a way that is not like what is typical for the you that I know but I saw YOUAnd you were a sight for sore eyesI'll admit I should have stayed inside the store thinking back on the event now as it plays back in my head But instead I summoned every possible ounce of courage that I could hope to find opened the door and I walked out and slowly walked across the lot to the left towards my car clearly within your line of sight as you were straight aheadOnce I got to my car you went into the store you were outside of my ability to see you so I have no idea if the tables were now turned and you were now watching me the way I had just been watching you from behind the glassA part of me hoped that you wereI'll admit I sat there for a minute and looked in the direction of the building and almost as if I could feel you standing on the other side of the glass looking out at me I smiled a halfsmile in your directionIt was a smile of longing a smile that said“I miss you I wish she hadn't been sitting beside you in the vehicle that you drove into the lot in because if she hadn't I would have come back into the building and spoken to you or lingered and given you the opportunity to approach me if you wanted to speak to me”I'll admit the whole time I was driving from where I started this morning until where I was when I'd arranged the 'chance' encounter I'd replayed in my head over and over what I would say to you if I encountered you and if I did if you spoke to me spoke to me kindly and spoke to me kindly with the intention of hearing me say something in returnIf all of those variables would have played out in my favor I would have said to you:“It was my intentions to leave you alone and give you the space that you requested but it was suggested to me by my brother who YOU APPROACHED a couple months ago and asked about me right off the bat My brother who did not recognize you at first so you COULD have walked away and no one would have been the wiser But YOU reached out to HIM when you saw him one day engaged him in conversation and you continue to connect with him each time you see him Even though while we were together you barely even knew him  So when my brother found out that I was feeling a certain way he suggested that I not stick to that plan but to instead come to you and be honest with you about a few thingsRather he insisted So against my best judgement I am going against what I told myself I would do in order to allow you the chance to know that I have prepared my amends for youMany would say that I am not the one who should have amends to offer YOU That you were the one who turned your back on 35 years of our life together and the future we were planning and you did so with a DEAR JOHN letter because you were confusedBut regardless of what people say and regardless of what I have a right to feel or not to feel I felt the need to offer you my amends regarding things I recognized in the time we have spent the previous months apart that have felt like the worst version of eternity imaginable where my actions could have led to your confusionEven if my amends did nothing to change the circumstances of who you chose to share your life with I still felt it necessary to offer those amends to you so that you knew that I knew  I felt You deserved to knowI wrote them and anonymously placed them on my blog in a way that they could not be traced to anyone but that if you were to one day stumble upon them you would know without a doubt that it was me writing them to youI have gone through and screenshot the entire blog post and saved them on the flat phone under the screenshot album and that is the only thing on the phone everything else has been erasedYou can take the phone read it offline the blog itself is bookmarked in the Internet history if you access WiFi and want to read other blog posts there are several blog posts to you on that blog all posted anonymously of course over the course of the last couple of years during the time when I have not abandoned you even when you thought I hadYou certainly don't have to read it now or ever but I owed you my amends and I wrote them for you so I owed it to you to at least find a way to give them to you so that you had a chance to know if you wantedWhat you do with them from this point forward is up to you of course and I of course will respect your choice in whatever you chose to doThat's the long and short of what I would have saidBut as my luck would have it you were not alone this timeOf all the mornings you stop in that same place with your work buddies of all the times you are seen with just the guys I WOULD just HAPPEN to have been there the ONE time that you showed up WITH HER for the SECOND TIME since you've been back in town in the last year the SECOND TIME WITH HER the first time being a few weeks after you got back 'in town' almost a full year ago I mean what are the oddsIs the universe trying to tell me somethingOr were YOU trying to tell me somethingBecause I'll tell you what Priceless M Man I noticed something VERY specific about the way you kept posturing your bodyIt was like you were purposely redirecting yourself away from me after I came out of the store when you were outside also Like you were trying to noticeably show that you were not pointing yourself in my direction But in a way you almost seemed like you still knew where I wasIt reminded me of the way the dog used to look at me when he knew he had done something he wasn't supposed to and knew he was in trouble and was hoping I wasn't about to yell at him so he'd make himself try to be not noticedBut not for my benefitAlmost like you were trying to keep HER from noticing that I was thereNow That could very well have just been my imagination but it also could have been very real and I could have just been seeing what you were doing and knowing what it was because what I have been feeling all this time has not been wrongSo I started my car and went to the exit that did not pass directly by your vehicle I did not want to draw immediate attention to myself from her I didn't want to cause you problemsI found something on my playlist I could live with for driving since it was gonna be loud as hell and the windows were down And I hopped up on the main roads which had no choice but to pass by your line of sightI'll admit I started off slowly and stole one last glance of you as I drove away There was no telling when or if I was going to have another chance to see that precious sight again and I wanted to soak it all in before I lost itBut even though you surely knew I was leaving your eyes did not directly follow me I can't help but think you did it that way on purpose Your chin lifted and your head as well as posture turned towards your vehicle as if you were picking up in the middle of a conversation with her or catching her attention as I drove offSo Ill admit I laid on the gas and kicked up dust and figured if nothing else maybe the sound and feel of my Chevy that you once loved so much to drive would at least be the faint echo that left its mark on your heartstrings instead of my words this morningBut I will admitIt was no accident that I saw you there I came for you I came for you because I miss you I've missed you and loved you this whole time and haven't been able to tell youI came to you this morning to tell youBut I couldn'tBut it doesn't change the fact that I still doWith loveGingy💕", 650227)
("For the past month I have been sitting in my bedroom crying Fighting the person I am and decisions I am making I was never happy with any of it but I didn't know how to change We all make poor decisions and bad choices but everyone refuses to talk about them I don't blame them honestly No one wants people to know their wrongdoings and no one wants to be called names No one wants to admit that we have been those people who we judge and look down upon But in order to be stronger people mistakes must be made I have made them I have made all of them it seems She wasn’t my first love but my second I had gone 5 years between the two relationships In my first I was the loyal one I have two great parents who set a great example of monogamy She was cheating and I was oblivious to all of this Until I finally caught her kissing some guy at a party in some bushes who she later slept with that night I felt betrayed broken inside like everything she had said was all a lie She said she loved me and it was a drunken mistake so I accepted her apology and we moved forward together The thought of the betrayal eventually drove me crazy I couldn’t seem to remove the image of her kissing another man from my mind Spring break 2013 I got my revenge Which would eventually lead to a downward spiral of me breaking heart after heart I was like a train with no brakes there was no stopping me I would never believe women when they said they we’re into me because I felt as if I was impossible to love 5 years of that behavior one night at a friend’s Halloween party I would meet my second love Her blue eyes shined differently than any other girl I had ever met She treated me with such compassion walked tall with her pride and confidence She treated me in such a way that made me feel like I WAS lovable I probably don't need to bury into details for you to understand where this story ends up I cheated on my girlfriend I felt no guilt had no sorries And I still didn't stop I didn't know how to react to more than one girl wanting me at once I barely knew how to react with just one But I never realized how badly I was hurting her I had allowed that pain I felt with my first love to leak over time  Besides she would never find out rightWrong She did She even gave me another chance and I blew it She dumped me and was with another man within a monthSince the breakup my life has been a disaster I have experienced pain both emotionally &amp; physically Couldn’t eat a meal because I felt undeserving of one Couldn’t go a day without texting her to relentlessly apologize and beg for her forgiveness This slowly progressed to suicidal thoughts google searches of “least painful way to die” attempts to formulate a plan Now I know what you’re thinking “You deserve to feel that way” or “Imagine how she feels” You wouldn’t be wrong in thinking that either I now remember how I felt with my first love and how my second must feel That gut wrenching loss of trust and betrayal  I’ve gone online to try and find resources to change stories of other men who have overcome the immaturity of infidelity just to find hateful Quora comments from men &amp; women alike talking about how people like me are the “scum of the earth” or “I’d be better off never dating again” The truth is I had been so focused on her happiness so focused on attempting to help rebuild her and showing my love with gifts apologies countless text messages that I haven’t taken time to focus on the matter at hand I asked for this after all this is what I signed up forI write this article as a resource when I couldn’t find any I write this because I know there is someone out there who feels the same way I do People don’t get it I truly loved her I never wanted to hurt her I never wanted anyone else I was merely insecure from my first relationship I needed validation that I was lovable and this wasn’t just a fluke When looking back she gave me all the love a man could ask for She did all the right things She was perfect in my eyes but it just seemed too good to be true I guessWhat’s my view on cheating now CHEATING IS WRONG It’s a selfish act to hang on to someone to feel secure while you go out and find someone else to fill the void It makes your partner feel as if they aren’t enough unable to be loved It destroys the trust that is the foundation of every relationship So fellow cheaters you want the cold hard truth The pain &amp; guilt will never go away You will constantly be reminded of your wrong doings Not a day has gone by where I haven’t sat and thought of my choices and how things would be different had I stayed faithful I have yet to forgive myself for what I did to her and I’m not sure that I ever will The good news We can learn from this experience and grow Now I no longer have a passcode on my phone besides protected info like credit cards bank account etc I leave my phone in any room and anyone is free to look through it I made a conscience decision to not associate with men or women who cheat anymore I’m an open book I will talk to future partners about my past  and how I’ve learned from it If problems arise in the relationship we can talk about it or mutually agree to break it off if it is unresolvable The most important thing to do is to find happiness within yourself first Be happy with who you are Build your own confidence Sure we have made some mistakes that will linger with us possibly for our lives But our mistakes do not define us They can’t Only we can define ourselves The chances of me ever getting back with her are pretty much obsolete ain’t happening bro Yes that sucks However she deserves the world  She deserves a partner who can make her happier than I ever could and I am so proud of her for having the selfworth to move on That is what true love is in my opinion Allowing them to be happy regardless of whether or not you’re in the picture I’ve got beef with the term “Once a cheater always a cheater” Because it suggests change is not possible It suggests that people who smoked for 20+ years were unable to cut their bad habit when they do every day It suggests people are unable to lose weight when they can It suggests criminals will always be criminals despite their efforts to turn around after jail and have a positive influence on the community It’s an ignorant statement because I was a cheater and I no longer am I’m living proof", 647707)
('Names are fake of courseSo I had kind of known this boy since I was thirteen We went to the same school and he’s only one year older than I F17 am Adam was known around the whole town for being a trouble maker He did drugs sold drugs eventually bossed people around who sold drugs for him partied a lot and rumors were flying around about him having threatened someone with a knife Though everyone his age absolutely adored him He got invited to every party because he always did something funny or crazy and he always gave everyone the attention they needed I figured they were only rumors after all and he had never treated me badly We first met officially at one of these parties He was extremely charming and also very attractive I don’t remember exactly how we started seeing each other so often but it happened and suddenly I was at Adams place at least one day every weekend We made out conversed about life and just cuddled Everything about him was so unlike what I had thought he would be like He was actually capable of talking about deep subjects he had a healthy outlook on life and good morals Especially when it came down to treating women with respect He was very verbal about thinking that many guys he knew were so horrible and treated girls so badly I was well aware that we’d never become anything serious because of his very grave criminal behavior Everyone in our town knew who he was and I was told by my mother that I should keep away from him I thought I knew him better than that I at least thought I knew him well enough to know that he wouldn’t do me any harm So I thought it wouldn’t hurt to kind of use him I guess when I wanted to make out with someone That’s what I thought he was doing with me as well When he told me that he was in love with me I didn’t know if I believed it or not He used to lie about everything even serious stuff but in a ‘joking manner’ if you understand what I mean by that So I laughed it off He continued telling me though Every time I saw him he told me he was in love with me and finally I sort of believed him and started feeling bad that I’d been using him like this while he was having actual feelings for me I started thinking a lot about what my feelings for him actually were but could never decide I decided to throw a party one weekend and invited all of my close friends I did not invite Adam luckily One of my friends Amy didn’t come and when I asked my other friend Lola why she said it was because Adam may come and Amy couldn’t risk meeting him My first thought was that they must have had some sort of fight at some party and it would be awkward but Lola then explained that Amy had been raped by Adam I couldn’t believe it at first I sat in my parents bedroom crying and completely panicking for the next few hours until a girl came in to talk to me We talked for a long time and she explained that he had apparently raped more girls I was a complete mess for the rest of the night Well for the rest of the month None of us could do anything though Amy had made us promise not to report him because it could put her in danger And it was true It really could put her in danger if we did Adam was one of the top criminals in our little town and he had a whole pack behind him I’ve heard afterwards that people apparently call him ‘the lion’ or some stupid shit like that He called later that evening when I found out and the only thing I said was that I never wanted to see him again and hung up Sometimes I get so fucking mad at my friends who didn’t immediately tell me when they found out I get that it’s a sensitive subject to spread around but they basically risked another girl being raped How much do they really care about me I was very down for a long time afterwards and I still question why he never did anything to me It scares me so much whenever I think about how many times I was alone with him and what could have happened Am I right about being mad at my friends over this I mean they waited about a week or two to tell me I get that Amy must have told them to not tell anyone but shouldn’t anyone have said “hey maybe we should tell our friend who’s hanging out with him all the time so she won’t get raped” Ok so that’s my rant I can’t really get solid advice on how to handle it from anyone around me because no one wants to talk about it Including me Maybe this is the wrong sub I don’t know', 646893)
('If anyone I know from my family happens to see this sorry for telling random people on the Internet about our life And if you’re my aunts though I highly doubt it sorry for exposing you to the Internet and being 100% honestI live in a good neighborhood go to a good school and I am fortunate enough to be living under a roof because of my aunts But I hate living with themBackground Information this is a lot to read you can skip to “TL;DR”: My mom the one person who’s taken care of me my entire life until July 2018 is currently in S Korea because of a business she’s trying to start with my stepdad completely unplanned but she said it was a good opportunity for the family Before then I was living with my maternal grandma in her condo for a little less than a year along with my mom due to something complicated that’s not relevant Ever since my mom took off I was forced to go back to my older brother and sister to the house I’ve always lived in since I’m not old enough to live on my own Sept 2017 was around the time my biological dad got fired from his wellpaying job because of an extremely stupid reason As a result he struggled to pay for the house and we got an eviction notice It just so happened that my aunts’ one year contract on their apartment expired so they decided to move in to help pay rent My dad doesn’t live with me and he couldn’t move in because of reasons I’m not 100% sure ofTL;DR: paternal aunts moved in to help my biological dad pay rent mom is currently in S Korea I’m now stuck with said auntsI am going to call my aunts “J” and “S”Let’s talk about a few incidents that’s happened so far: “S” dislikes my older brother because of his girlfriend it’s complicated; went out of her way to annoy both of them as much as possible “S” has threatened my brother with a knife and smashed a glass plate at his feet she went to jail for three days both “J” and “S” kicked out my brother unexpectedly even though he did nothing wrong they painted the front door of OUR house not even theirs an ugly color without telling anyone before they did so the paint job was done badly too they took the keys to my mom’s nice car drove in it and acted like it was theirs without asking my mom for permission no—without telling ANYONE this is no longer a concern; it’s been taken care of their dogs chewed up my sister’s expensive headphones to the point of no repair and they did not want to pay for new ones their dogs chewed up my only nice pair of shoes “J” and “S” can’t train their dogs properly; only smacks the table or counter really loudly and yell at them they keep moving everything without telling me or my sister beforehand; we never know where anything is the house started becoming disgusting once they moved in: the floor is always sticky because they can’t clean their dogs’ piss completely I wear slippers around the house now the counters are greasy and sticky I don’t even know how that happens and I can assure you that this was not done by me or my sister I can’t even trust the couch because the dogs sit in it and I just—no I’m never sitting there what if the dogs accidentally peed on the couch or something like no thanks “S” or “J” moved my electric toothbrush somewhere; told me they didn’t know where it was when I asked them I had to get a completely new one “S” or “J” moved my shower gloves shampoo and soap somewhere like why would you touch it it’s mine “S” or “J” took an amazing facial soap away from me to use for themselves that was given to me as a gift from MY MOM it was meant for ME not THEM my older sister was using a basket to keep all of her ID stuff permit social security birth certificate and it was a nice basket so my aunt decided to dump all of the contents into the trash so she could take it for herself again without telling anyone my sister had to dig her stuff out of the trash “J” keeps barging into my room without knocking to tell me simple things like “it’s time to eat” this is a petty thing it’s not something I’m used to since my mom actually respected my privacy like you can just knock “J” barges into my room after knocking without even letting me give the OK I started to lock my door because I was starting to get annoyed; “J” didn’t like me locking the door to my own room and told me to stop I didn’t; said she’d break down the door if I continued to lock it “J” said “I’m not your mom but I could be”; first of all what secondly no I would never want you as my mom you tell me I’m a kid one day then tell me I’m old enough to do everything myself the next; either way you won’t take responsibility because I know that’s how you are based on everything that’s happened before “J” told my sister she’s moving out on July 1stI have come to the conclusion that my aunts didn’t move in to help my dad pay rent; they moved in so they could take our house for themselves the house is bigger and in a nicer area than they were living in before It only makes sense why else would they kick out both my brother and sisterI am aware that my situation is no where near as bad as others’ I sometimes feel bad about feeling frustrated because I know there are people out there who have it worse than me I just really needed to vent because I don’t know how much longer I can stand those two anymore I feel like I can’t do anything because it feels like they’re constantly watching me they put a security camera in the house for God’s sake I don’t feel like cooking anything anymore because I don’t want them to judge me or think my mom did a bad job at raising her kids they’ve said this before to her face and nothing has ever made me more furious because her child “can’t cook properly” I stay locked up in my room all day so that I don’t have to talk to them I just don’t feel like doing anything anymore My sister and I were shoved into the smallest room in the house and there’s barely any space to walk meanwhile “S” has the second largest room with barely half the space filled Not only that but our room is such a mess because we have to keep everything in our room if we don’t want to lose it I hate living like this I should not worry about my things being stolen in my own home but I have toI just want my mom back but I know I have to be patient so I’m trying to suck it up She always told me that these things happen for a reason', 646655)
('I am a edgy 14 y/o kid that is obese and tries to do better things for myself I am also a car enthusiast which is easy for people to make fun of me because "its not normal" I have had my fair share with friends but it wasn\'t until last year where I had nobody to talk to I added a girl on snapchat Name was Karen half a year ago and me an her talked about everything I mean everything We share so much about ourselves and talked so much that almost anything reminded me or her about each other It was amazingMarch of this year I was in church on a Sunday explaining that I will get back to her I texted "I love you" to her and I tried to send it it wouldn\'t send I then text her by number and she said that snapchat isn\'t working for her so I get relieved After church I try texting it says it won\'t send Text by number no answer Call her number it does one dial tone and then sends me to voice mail It wasn\'t until the next day that I realize that she had blocked me on everything to block communication from meRemember how I said that almost everything reminded me of her Well that\'s important because while I was trying to get over her I just can\'t From songs to objects remind me of her and I just break down whenever she comes to mind It was during this time where I had a second best friend which we will call Desiree She was two years younger than me no big deal but to my friends anyone who isn\'t in my grade can\'t be related to me or else I am a pedophile Their logic doesn\'t make sense but whatever Me and her talk almost identical to how me and Karen talked Me and her shared our experiences and how me and her shared a lot in common and how people back stabbed us and it was amazing We never met irl despite her living in the same trailer park as me but we go to different schools so it made senseIt wasn\'t until this month where I started seeing her outside with her best friends She had like 6 all boys same age as her She complained about how nobody was with her and how she was alone all the time but she goes everywhere with those same 5 guys I start getting upset about how she was lying to me about this I also posted on my story "Its funny how when you guys talk down on yourselves i\'m always there to help but when something is wrong with me nobody comes forward to talk" because its true People have even made fun of me for having suicidal thoughts Yes making fun of someone who wants to leave the lives of everyone because of bullying She saw the post on my story and didn\'t say a word I get really upset and I just start getting suicidal thoughts again because I offered my trust and heart to this girl and all she does with mine is roll it under her bed and forgets about it Both Desiree and Karen scarred me and now it results in me not trusting anyone isolating myself having suicidal thoughts being alone 100% and just wanting to live by myself at times She used to text me things like "I wanna hangout with you sooooo badd" but it was all a lie I am by myself everywhere I follow people around or else I am alone and I am never busy yet she says the same things she says shes alone open for everything yet she goes everywhere with her friends and everyone wants to be with her while I am suffering and wishing I was dead at time and she helps barely This shit pisses me off and I just can\'t be bothered with her I recently texted her because she posted herself smiling and I said "You\'re still cute" and she responds "thank you :" I then text her whats wrong and she hasn\'t texted me back so I am just gonna end up giving up on everything I just want to give up on life and even though I am young ive been through so many things that I feel like nothing is new to me anymore im just sick of hearing lies and now when someone texts me anything I will just think it\'s a lie I just can\'t do this shit anymore', 643380)
('Just found this place and I have a few pounds kept in my heart so I hope you guys don\'t mind if I just take them off of my chest here  I\'ve got no job and live with my parents I\'m still a highschool teenager with hormonal bursts I have no bills no problems at school with grades I\'m just average at everything and got my group of 4 best friends who always stick together and \'walk in band\' among other tribes The thing is: I really can\'t stand being myself anymore The only thing I can think of is that I\'m tired And it\'s not of school It\'s not of my friends or family which I love a lot It\'s not of my routine I\'m tired of living all of that being me  I\'m 17M and never kissed anyone I\'m just living on my on and this was very good for a while I could focus on my grades and games while my friends were having a good time with girls in general However the moment I decided I wanted something more with someone else I found out that I wasn\'t alone just because I wanted to but also because I can\'t get out of this state of solitude   I\'m either too ugly or too boring for people I couldn\'t find out which one of the two I am but I\'m the guy who manages to make the most sympathetic and patient person in the world get uncomfortable and go away I\'ve no idea of what makes people run from me other than my friends of course It just happens  I\'m a failed man and my life hasn\'t even started yet I had a girlfriend only once: from January to June of 2019 a total of 5 months and it was online only yes my only relationship was a webdating We barely met and she already proposed to me which was a great step for someone so desperate as me and you can already tell that since it wasn\'t natural it wasn\'t meant to be We were both needy and that\'s why we both just accepted each other\'s company a few weeks after knowing each other She lives 45 miles away from where I live and there was no way I could get there other than taking a bus as we kept each other as a secret from our parents for a long time We really had no way to meet and now I know that \'dating\' her was the worst of my mistakes this year  After a few weeks I told my parents about her and started making plans to meet her By that time it was clear that she had already lost interest in me Our relationship was shortlived but her feelings for me were already long gone when we broke up last week On the other hand I fell more and more in love for her each day we called each other on whatsapp she refused to use anything else As the days passed those calls were less frequent and she was becoming more and more absent I lost her she was not needy anymore She didn\'t need me anymore She was content and ready for someone else to make her happy and take my place – if you can call *that* \'my place\'Weeks passed and I got suspicious I was sure that she betrayed me I can\'t prove it until this day so I just try to forget that but I just refuse to believe that she was content with the broken relation we had She was as needy and dependent as me It is not something you can just overcome all of a sudden you know Also the fact that she kept me as a secret even from her friends bothered me There were days when she wouldn\'t talk to me because "she didn\'t have time to answer me and all of her friends" I feel a deep pain when I remember those details  I know it is just a girl who I met on the internet Technically we couldn\'t even walk hand in hand But I think I fell in love with her I just got used to her everyday talking to me I got used to someone saying "I love you" Someone outside my family Someone who didn\'t love me for biological reasons Someone who didn\'t love me at all in the end  I have no idea of what to do I don\'t want her back but I want her so badly It\'s almost as if "The Cardigans  Loveffol" was written for me because I feel an immense desire to hear her saying that she loves me even though I know it\'s not true Even though I know she probably has someone else and that I just won\'t move on because I\'m a failed man who doesn\'t know how to attract other people Someone who keeps himself in a state of having pity of him and hating him at the same time I have no one to talk to as no one cares about it The only one who should think about a solution is me but I can\'t because the only thing I think is her and the men who probably are using her like a peace of meat right now In a way she does not deserve but allows them to treat her  I\'m not the nice guy who could offer her better I\'m an egoistic boy who wants to keep a person to himself just because he can\'t move on without her Just because he became useless without her I would love to ask for help of some of you but I know that the only answer for me is to move on and that\'s something I\'m not strong enough to do So if you read until here thank you for listening to me I just wanted to take this off of my chest It still hurts but part of the pain is seald here from now on so I hope I can be more useful from now on without this portion of the weight', 643243)

('This is gonna be a long post To keep this as short as possible I’m going to get to the point This is a story of how one fateful call with a hotline psychic in 2014 led to me getting tricked into making a deal with the devil Four years ago I was a sophomore in college and lonely as hell I felt like I had no direction in life I had no friends and I was lonely I had just broken up with a boyfriend I truly wasn’t in love with and had this weird back and forth with this older guy whom I never met I needed answers One day I don’t remember what prompted me to do so but I ended up speaking with a hotline psychic She was nice and all and we had a nice conversation She was clairaudient as in she could hear these things called “spirit guides” and she was also a tarot card reader Well after talking with her I became curious about tarot cards and after some research online I bought myself a pack off Ebay for just 11 bucks That was the worst decision of my life I remember getting the cards and I immediately became enamored by them I would read my cards every day and soon I was reading them multiple times a day Before long I found myself obsessed with the tarot and couldn’t make a decision without reading about it I read about my past my future the people in my life my finances school and what people thought of me I started becoming isolated spending hours in my room with my tarot cards Before long I became interested in pendulum dowsing which is when you hold a weighted object by a string and somehow it can tell you about the future and other things you would otherwise have no prior knowledge to And then I found out about automatic writing With automatic writing you basically take a pen to paper and can access your “higher self” your subconscious or spiritual beings on the other side I ended up wanting to contact my guardian angel because back then I believed that everyone had one Well one came through and called himself Matthew which I knew was a biblical name and he was very sweet loving and basically would tell me how much he loved and cared for me Soon enough I was talking to what are known as spirit guides Spirit guides in the Western new age movement are basically spiritual beings that used to be human that are assigned to you to help lovingly guide you through life The first one called himself Daniel the second one called herself Pamela and the third one called himself Nicholas I also had these guides called temporary guides and they would supposedly be assigned to me for a very short period of time or during a major life event I don’t know why but I believed them straight away even though I knew that sometimes notsoloving beings with nefarious motives would pretend to be loving spirit guides Like the tarot I became hooked with automatic writing and soon I was speaking to them every day and most times multiple times a day I became obsessed with it and felt a close bond with them The weird thing though was even though these beings were nice and loving there was something off about the whole thing and I couldn’t put my finger on it Anyways fast forward to a year ago that’s when shit pretty much hit the fan In the span of several months I had lost my longterm relationship my job all my friends I was homeless for a bit spent time in a nursing home and was hospitalized five times I had a psychotic break caused by marijuana and Vyvanse Turns out I was bipolar and schizophrenic It didn’t help that I was pretty much obsessed at this point with the occult I had this weird and traumatizing encounter with a boss at work that pretty much started my downward descent to complete madness He ended up crossing a boundary which I had prior knowledge of because of these spirit guides and the tarot The tarot pretty much predicted what happened and "Daniel" said he found me on this BDSM site I was on and to stay away from him On Sunday July 14 2018 I did a weekly reading and it said that something major was going to happen at work on July 18 2018 Well fast forward to July 18 and that was the day my life changed forever My boss unexpectedly showed up to my workplace He was my boss’s boss and he crossed a major boundary with me even though he knew I had a boyfriend and workplace romances were strictly prohibited at my job What was weird is that a few weeks prior I began to audibly hear these spirit guides and the spirit guides of other people because back then I believed that everyone had not only a guardian angel but spirit guides who guided them through life I became convinced that I was psychic Looking back I believe that those spirit guides were actually demons pretending to be spirit guides I had been manipulated for four years by them and their true colors came out during the descent but it was so subtle that I didn’t realize it until a few months ago They pretty much said that this boss had become obsessed with me and was stalking me They also said that he was a white supremacist this I don’t doubt and wanted me a black woman to rape and then kill What’s weird is that I wholeheartedly believed them even though there was no concrete evidence to their claims That’s when I became introduced to the idea of a guardian demon and these spirit guides told me that God himself appointed me a guardian demon named Damian when I suffered a traumatic head injury when I was 11 that could have killed me I was on the edge of psychosis during this and began talking to Damian I never automatic wrote with him but I could hear him audibly By then I had left the nursing home and was now back with my ex as I tried to find housing The spirit guides had helped me along the way but I was still convinced that my boss was stalking me because they stood steadfast in that claim despite no actual evidence Around Halloween 2018 I had this scary vision as I was in bed with my ex one night I saw my boss and what looked like a demon Then I heard a voice that called himself the devil I don’t know if I was psychotic or if I genuinely heard this voice or even both But to this day I genuinely believe that I came face to face with the devil himself My ex was flying to Detroit that morning and I would be alone with the dog for only a few days He had taken away my tarot cards and I ended up finding them in his car and stole them Soon enough I was back to the tarot and was very obsessive about it believing that this man I hadn’t seen in months was after me The day my ex left for Detroit was a very weird day and I was convinced that my boss was going to come to my house with some KKK members and brutally rape and murder me I was also convinced that he was going to release the explicit pictures that I had on that BDSM site The night my ex left I was alone and the devil pretty much said that I would die alone and penniless By this time I was so unhappy with my life and was at the lowest point I had ever been so I believed him I then attempted suicide by impulsively taking 50 pills of my antianxiety medication As I was laying in bed ready to die I saw a shooting star and was freaked out and asked God to send me to Georgetown I then saw another shooting star Then I ran to my computer and began to automatic write In my delirium I forgot to say a prayer and the being on the other side confirmed that I had seen two shooting stars It told me to ask the devil to help me find my soulmate and in a foggy state from the medication I took I said it out loud I never actually wrote it out The being on the other side told me what to ask for I felt weird because I believed in God and would never willingly make a deal with the devil or demons But I said it anyways I believe that whatever told me to say that was taking advantage of the fact that I had just tried to commit suicide Then I put on some headphones and listened to meditation music I ended up waking up that morning alive I went to the hospital and was admitted for a suicide attempt There I automatic wrote and the scariest thing happened I opened up a realm to God knows where and these demons and monsters ended up crossing to the physical plane I saw it with my own eyes I left the hospital and within a few months had miraculously found the apartment of my dreams which I prayed to God for Well when I moved in some weird supernatural shit began to go down I was convinced to do witchcraft against my boss something I’d never do I dabbled in witchcraft years prior and stopped because I got freaked out by it I wholeheartedly believe that witchcraft works but idk how Who knows what that stuff did to him and I don’t even want to think about it I ended up seeing the Devil himself and I was at my breaking point Turns out I was basically possessed and being oppressed by demons that were on the inside of me with some attacking me from the outside I looked up the signs of demonic possession and pretty much had every single symptom I could hear them and they would speak to me through my mouth I would convulse and my head would twist and contort on its own They attacked me physically and sometimes sexually I couldn’t tell anyone in my life because people would just chalk it up to my schizophrenia but I was going crazy literally by this I decided to contact a local exorcist and called him six times before I got an appointment I went to the church for a service and I hadn’t been to church in several years at this point In my teens I was an atheist Then agnostic And then a deist I ended up getting exorcised and some very scary voices manifested I’m still going through this I’m going to keep getting exorcised and I’m in the process of a very lengthy and frustrating deliverance  To preface my next point I met this guy last weekend through the BDSM site that I was on and we met up and had a wonderful time He was everything I was looking for except he wasn’t a Christian and didn’t seem that open to Christ By this time I had given up everything that had to do with occult I had figured out through my pastor and church that those spirit guides and that angel were beings of darkness that masqueraded as beings of light When I figured that out I noped the fuck out of the occult and never looked back I became a born again Christian which was confusing because I am a BDSM submissive and felt like a hypocrite I stopped engaging in casual sex I gave up masturbation I gave up drugs cut down significantly on my drinking and I started reading the Bible However I want to be in a loving relationship with a Dominant as crazy as that sounds The demons that were oppressing me delighted in telling me that I was a hypocrite for this and going to hell They are so mean and say very hurtful things and when I call out to Jesus and rebuke them they get even angrier and I start to convulse There’s this demon inside me that calls itself Lucifer and so far my pastor has been unsuccessful in getting rid of it Turns out he won’t leave because I made a deal with him and pretty much got what I wanted This guy from the site was what I had apparently asked for or so he claims Yet for some reason I don\'t think he\'s telling a complete lie with that one IDK why but I prayed to God about it and that\'s the inkling I got I was so horrified that I felt so guilty and considered ghosting this guy even though I really liked him Basically I’m still going through this deliverance and since I accepted Christ the demons inside me are much more aggressive than ever My pastor says its because they know that they lost and want to take me to hell with them which would have happened had I died the night I attempted suicide Sometimes I get chills whenever I think of the suicide attempt because I would be burning in hell right now and that’s what they all wanted even the spirit guides and the angel who claimed to love me so much I will NEVER go back to the tarot or anything to do with the occult It ruined my life and almost had me successfully kill myself I’m going through demonic possession right now because of it and I regret everything to do with it and probably will for the rest of my life I think I serve as a cautionary tale for anyone interested in the occult or anyone in the occult It’s a very dangerous thing to mess around with because you are venturing into a void that no human being knows I warn against anyone interested in this stuff because demons are VERY real and want nothing more than to cause havoc in your life and possibly send you to hell with them They are extremely cunning conniving and manipulative They were nice to me at first and pretended to be spirit guides to gain my trust and it took four years for them to turn on me They have all the time in the world and what is four years to them If I were you I would never touch anything to do with the occult I’m not saying become a Christian and I’m not selling you Christianity because it’s a very personal choice but all I’m saying is don’t touch the occult If your friends are playing with a ouija board run the hell out of there In fact run away from anything to do with the occult Don\'t even consult psychics if possible I remember when my brother said I was playing with black magic when I became involved with the tarot and I scoffed at him Now I believe he was right TL;DR: I became demonically possessed after 4 years in the occult It caused me to lose my mind and attempt suicide The night of my suicide attempt I was tricked by a being through automatic writing to make a deal with the devil Despite many exorcisms this demon inside me named Lucifer won’t leave claiming I got my end of the deal through a great guy I met and I’m working with my church to get rid of him for good I’m a cautionary tale of why the occult is dangerous and should never be meddled with', 642111)

Especially me  But here it is  Whether you read it or not I suppose is up to you  Honestly there probably wont be anything of worth in it but I think too much  Far too much  Im sure you know I overthink things  So here I am  Just typing awayIm writing to you to just ask a simple question  What happened to us  How did we get where we are  Better question  Why did we let ourselves get to where we are  Why did we make so many wrong decisions in a row  So many decisions  So many actions  Things that can never be undone  Words that can never be unsaid  Why did we do these things to ourselves  To each other  Where did we go wrong  What happenedWhy didn’t we both try harder  And when we did try why couldn’t it have been at the same time  Why couldn’t we have been blessed to both have seen the right choice  To see the right path  At the same time as the other  I just don’t understand  We got so caught up in what we were doing  What we thought was right  What we thought we wanted  When in the end we already had what we wanted  We didn’t need more  We just needed to do better  To truly show each other what we each meant to each other  But we didn’t  not until it was too late  I never should have let you go  But I did  You know me as a person  I don’t like to regret things in life  I truly don’t  but some things just cant be seen until its too late  Ill always regret letting you go name  It was the worst decision of my life  Day in and day out  I think of you name  I cant stop  Its not fair  I want to stop but I just cantI treated you so horribly name  I said so many horrible things to you  Behind your back  To your face  Things that I have trouble living with myself saying  Ive treated you so badly  So wrongly  Mistakes happen  Weaknesses prevail  I blame myself just as much as I blame you  But I don’t want you to think this letter is a blame letter  Or a shame letter  Far from it Its just words  Words and thoughts that I need to get out of my head I need you to read or know what im thinking and what im going throughYour family means so much to me  They cant be replaced ever  And I don’t want to replace them  But it was just a connection closer to you  I wanted to get so far away from you  I was just so angry  All I did was let this anger  Bitterness  Resentment  Hatred  Build and build  I thought I could replace you  I thought I could find something else  Someone else  But youre irreplaceable  I want you to know that  Im sorry for stopping all contact with you  With your family  I wanted to talk to you  I wanted to be friends  I do still  But it just doesn’t make sense  We have ruined it Both of us  Just destroyed what we tried so hard to buildWe got so far in life together  We accomplished so much  Home purchased at 20  Paid off at 28  High school  College Helped each other secure jobs  We were going to start a family together  We grew up together  We were going to grow old together  We were so much to each other  We were each others rock Support Base  We were always there for each other  And it just fell apart  We gave up A long time ago  Why didn’t we talk more  Why didn’t we try to communicate more  To fix our problems  Why did we just let our relationship crumbleYou keep asking me whats wrong and I keep having the response of nothing  But ten years teaches you better  You're not stupid  Far from it  One of the smartest people I know honestly  Im just not happy  Im not where I thought I would be in life  Im not in a position I want to be in  im not doing the things I want to be doing  Im not making decisions I am happy with  My life is still falling apart eight months later  You would have figured by now that I would be rebuilding my life but that’s not the truth  I just cant get it together  I cant do this adulting thing  I cant figure myself out  I am losing my way  Im becoming someone I don’t want to be  Im not proud of myselfNone of this matters though  None of it should matter to you  I just feel like I need to talk and even now I feel like youre the only person I can really truly talk to  Sure I have my sister but its not the kind of talking I need  Still don’t talk to my parents really  I just still think of you and think of a friend  Think of a listener  Someone that can help  Youre a good person name  We all make bad decisions and make mistakes  But you’re a good person deep down  Don’t let anyone tell you differentlyI truly wish you the best in life name  I hope that you find true happiness  True love  I hope you find someone that makes you happier than you have ever been  You deserve it  Really and truly  You deserve to be loved  To love  To be held  To hold  To be treated better than anyone else in the world  Youre a beautiful intelligent funny and caring person  You deserve the world  Im sorry I didn’t give you more  Im sorry I didn’t treat you better  More like a spouse and less like a family member  We just got too close  Too comfortable  Too complacent  We forgot who we were  What we were  We lost our way and forgot that first and foremost we were a couple  What happened  Why did we let that happenI think we got too focused on money  Our jobs took over our lives  All we cared about was money  We stopped trying to enjoy life  Enjoy each other  Focus on each other and our happiness  We started towards the end  But it was too late  Our relationship was already too fargone  The ruin had already started creeping in  we were just too late  We should neither ever forget thisHonestly  Our whole relationship should just be a lesson  A lesson for the future  For us both  Whenever we enter a new relationship we need to look at it and look at everything our relationship lacked  Everything we didn’t do for the other  And put forth the effort  We let the effort in our relationship stop  Once the effort stopped  The affection stopped  Once the affection stopped  We were doomed  We cant let that happen in future relationships  We cant let ourselves repeat us with someone else  Never stop trying  Never stop showing the other that you love themGood luck name  Good luck with all of your lifes endeavors  Good luck with everything  Youll go far in life  Youll be a great mother  And youll be a great wife again  Just don’t give up on anything", 641369)

('This is my first reddit post I don\'t know what I\'m or if im doing it right but maybe if I write it all down something somewhere might start to feel better&amp;#x200B;When I met you I don\'t think I ever imagined spending so much of my life begging for you I don\'t remember when I convinced myself I couldn\'t live without you but I know I have had your name in every breath for so long that its become the language I know the best Love is a selfish fucking thing isn\'t it "I miss you" is the equivalence of "I miss the home I created in you" We were never perfect we started off rough But we started off in love So much love and passion the only outcome of us being together was a raging destructive fire But I was okay with that We both said it Who cares if we burn down the entire city when we finally end up in each others arms we are home You wandered but we always came home Until you stopped coming home Until you made someone else your home You\'ve made homes in so many other girls with the things we built first I keep thinking you\'ll realize that I was your home first I loved you before anyone else did I answered all your calls I picked you up I took all your apologizes I was always your home when the rest were just hotels But now my home is empty I have no picture frames left no flowers no open windows My home is so empty because I never had a room for my self I never realized how little I had to offer myself since I only offered myself to you Ignorance is a bliss and I\'ve never understood more than losing you I miss you so much I don\'t want anything to do with you You are gone stay gone I know I can come over whenever I want don\'t lock the door My mind is everywhere I used to want you to come home so bad but now my home is empty and I\'m fucking terrified to start looking for new things to fill it with Failure is terrifying Rejection is terrifying Disappointment is terrifying I\'m not stupid enough to pretend you we didn\'t have those things too But I loved you so much that I could bury those as long as I was in your arms I miss your arms And if I said I don\'t think about how they hold someone else now I\'d be a liar I know she\'s in the bed I used to wake up in She cooks in the kitchen I used to buy food for She will get all the benefits of the tears I cried And the human in me is fucking livid It\'s not fair that I cried when I was with you and I cried now that I\'m alone This is not fucking fair I feel like I\'m going crazy I have so many problems in my life and I\'m crying over my ex\'s new girl friend But I grew up loving you Some how you managed to grow from me while all I did was grow in you I do not know how to be on my own I don\'t know how to stop looking for you in every guy I give my number too I don\'t know how to stop finding the things I hate in someone that I loved in you I don\'t fucking know how to get you out of me I know I\'m not supposed to rely on someone to save me but that would make shit so much easier But I don\'t even want that I dont want someone to save me I want to go back to my house The home we filled together with every night we spent hours telling each other why we loved one another Every smile you put on my face so effortlessly It\'s getting hard to remember how those smiles felt How those laughs sounded My house is sinking So I unblocked you Even thought you have a new house I knew I could get you to visit me And here I am taking a hit off you like some fucking drug addict Here the fuck I am Typing a pointless aimless post that nobody with logic would ever understand out of frustration that I can\'t hide inside of you anymore I dont know what to do My house is empty but its still a house right I just have to redecorate right So then why do i cry every fucking night It\'s just a break up It\'s nine years I don\'t know anyone but you not the way I know you Do I end this here My questions my feelings they all sound redundant I feel like a game of me being a ping pong ball where one side is going back to you and feeling safe and comfortable and the home full of memories and stories and one side is this new adventure all these new questions and this new found time but its lonely Its just me on that side What if I fuck up that side the way I fucked up the side I already know I am so scared to move I am so scared to make more mistakes to keep sinking my house You\'re not there to pull me out of the water anymore', 636870)
('My ex with a lot of mental issues being suicide depressed and spouting she wanted to kill herself everyday to me I\'ve tried helping her and offer to get her some help but to be shut down and scolded for reccomending it at all Just some context for the story but still feels it doesn\'t justify this situationI come home one day after work and check comes in and its short we argue i sort things out she goes to take a bath and we leave each other alone for the time being to cool off in my head She comes out of the bath explaining she has a razor blade in the restroom and tells me "why didn\'t you check on me I could have killed myself and you wouldn\'t even care or have noticed" mind you she hasn\'t done anything before she says she has and had texted me she was but when we broke up I went back and looked at all our old convos and found nothing So we argue some more and she tells me how miserable her life is and how unhappy she is with everything including me and the relationship so I snapped went into the kitchen grabbed a knife and yelled "if your so miserable then do it and end it all if you aren\'t happy with your life" slam the knife in the table next to her and leave the room slamming the door Snapping back to reality after a short few mins I run in and see she\'s crying and the knife isn\'t moved at all grab it and throw it away We broke up obviously but over some other issues we had had ie her cheating on me with other people online way before this incident with a lot of people she "loved" I\'ve told a few friends maybe 2 or 3 people but they told me It was a double edged sword situationIt was a few years ago but I find myself thinking of it off and on when I feel down and feel awful about it to this day It just rolls in my mind knowing if I told anyone how they would see me as a person Found out she was manipulative and a few other things too but even after finding that all out I still feel sick to my stomach from time to time when I think about it feeling I could never really help her out even though I\'ve tried so many times for so many years and nothing seemed to workKnowing what I did makes me feel I cant help anyone and telling anyone this makes me feel disgusting and have people seem me in a new and an unsightly way I\'ve since tried to feel better by helping some close friends with depression and suicidal thoughts feeling guilty for what I\'m didMy ex is happier now heard from a mutual friend I haven\'t spoken to her since we broke up and she isnt suicidal or depressed anymore so I figure it\'s all something that water under the bridge type scenario but for me it sits in my mind thinking I can never truly feel like I can make up for what I did to someone I loved so much and if I do snap and repeat it again what happens next These thoughts just ache me and my mind', 634201)
('Growing up i\'ve experienced a lot of things that are probably quite massive when it comes to mentaldevelopmentI used to be this highlyactive very expressive and also imaginative kid who likes to spend her time imagining things and turning it out to something I loved to draw things doing craft singing and most of all storytelling But also on the other hand i had this "introvertsign" thingy I used to avoid any loud environment or attending a family gathering My mom said that those things bothered me as a kid But i do remember back then in preschool i was a very sociable person I can get along with people easily People loved it when it comes to me storytelling stuff Then primary school I was the same person but the environment it gave me kinda pushed me to be quite monotoneI went to a school which was located in a militaryneighborhood And the teacher were like prioritizing my friend who were like so beautiful sweet and ofc she\'s a daughter of a military person The teacher didn\'t get along with me just because i answered the question wrong And i have no idea why those kind of things really triggers me to punish myself This happened when i was in a 3rd grade I was like "maybe it\'s better for me to not learn anything since i won\'t be appreciated" Of course i did good but it was not enough I wasn\'t in the top 10 Typical asian school requires you to have good grades for everything That stressed me out cause i loved to do something creative I was very confident but also shy at the same time This thing kinda built me to become a person who hates criticism who\'s afraid of what people think about me And that\'s bad i knowI moved to another city when i was in 4th grade This city feels way more peaceful Even though the traffic is really bad But the new school felt different That\'s when i know i really enjoy new environment I got along easily I blended in easily Everything was perfect I got really good grades being in the top 3 for 3 years straight Got everyone accepted me respected me and had a lot of amazing friends I expressed myself really good I enjoyed writing stories and harmonizing songs Drawing also one of my passions I could draw with either one of my hands And i think that\'s amazingEntering the secondary school My country relies on public school It has been told that public has way more advantages than private But in my city the private seems to have a lot of great facilities and diverse curriculum Since because i moved from another city and my parents hadn\'t change our certificate or those type of thing i couldn\'t get into any public school here My gpa supposedly eligible but i couldnt just because of my certificate So i had to enter this private school It has an Aaccreditation supposedly it was good But turns out my grades were higher than most students there I was a very excellent student But the environment it gave me didn\'t maximize my potential Didn\'t even give me any guidance on how to manage my interests So my grades were dropping I even got a boyfriend back then but he was very jealous of my capabilities which made him destroying me mentally for around a year Till i graduated with a decent gpa and a broken soul Of course i broke up with him soon afterSo i decided to go back to my hometown and registered for a public school there My hometown has districts And it sorts the students by it\'s closest way to their houses So i got to enter the eastern part cause it was close and again i got into a school which was located in between police and military area I was skeptical at first but i was hoping i could gain more friends and experiencesTurns out everyone there was different The teachers were kinda stressing me out The attitude of the excellent students there really stressed me out I had a dream to enter one of my country\'s prestigious uni and this student were like crushing my dream He was skeptical of me and etc Also i didn\'t know why i was such a rebel in high school I was a good person still But my attitude is way worse I hated the school hated the people i didn\'t even reach anything good My grades were fair Didn\'t even get any prize Couldn\'t get along with people I just have no idea why I did great outside school I hated it when my school tryna act like they\'re prestigious enough but inside they\'re just as dirty as the other one My 3 years were wasted for doing nothing And i can tell my capabilities were dropped into a significant amount Till i don\'t even recognize who i am anymoreI know there\'s something wrong with me But deep inside i always think that i\'m not special Who i am right now is what everyone sees No hope in gaining all my crushed dreams and full capabilities I lost my energy on everything It sucks and hurts at the same time I still love this "storytellingsoul" but right now i\'m feeling alone Literally like have no one to actually talk Anxiety depression loneliness all sorts of things have been bugging me out One thing that keeps me holding myself onto this is the fact that people thinking this is just a phase or maybe it\'s just my growth hormone or etc But i\'m feeling like i need help I\'m really sad', 633337)
('I am a boy who has always been codependent but at the same time have always loved my space I am quite outgoing and very fearless in how I present myself in public if I am around people that make me comfortable then I will say or do nearly anything that I would like to that would make me happy and I couldn\'t care less who was around Even though this is the case I had a very strange childhood coming from a family that had a lot of obstacles to overcome my sisters who is 4 years older biological father was murdered when I was a couple months old so that set the default for who would be given extra care and help in times of need just to outline really quickly I do not mind I am not sour or angry at my parents giving more support and aid to my sister than I Not only this but my cousin who was born a month after me was born into a very financially challenged family which lead to my father biological uncle of my cousin would be tending to my auntie and my cousin a whole lot as well he even go relocated in his job as a police officer to be stationed near her to protect her from harm abusive partners as there were a lot and what not My grandparents on my dads side also put more effort into that portion of the family too when they were with my direct family mum dad sister and myself my sister would always be favoured though On my mothers side her parents were split and not very prevalent due to finances and bouncing around of partners and so on I saw them but never made a connection with them All of this lead to me often being second third fourth in line for attention which once again was completely fine I am not mad or wishing it was any other way give support where support is needed I was doing fine so they let me cruise But being apart of all of this pushed me away my parents would argue a lot there was a lot of tension mum just like her mum turned to a lot of drinking it wasn\'t the most unhealthy household but it wasn\'t sunshine and rainbows Anyway on top of this my role model being my father who is a pretty groovy whacky bloke much like me I grew up with his sense of humour and interests of course I was steered down the path of being the outcast essentially that guy that was kinda like the other kids but also super different so much so I was deemed as lesser I never fit in&amp;#x200B;Due to my life being like this I was always given a hard time by everybody in my family and close family friends and if it wasnt them obviously showing they thought I was strange I could just tell I am really observational Through years Kinder  6 I had no real friends just people around at school i guess When I got to Highschool in Australian schooling terms 710 I really blossomed and made friends but quickly found myself bouncing between groups we had just moved to a new town and I was so chuffed to meet so many different types of people but never really fit in anywhere often found myself putting on a persona of someone I wanted to be Then I got to college 1112 and I found myself and realised that I should be myself and people will come Anyway me finally becoming comfortable like that was my whole life in the making I found friends I will have for life but my family life was still fucked I wasnt accepted as me until I was 17 and even then it wasnt acceptance it was "Oh thats just him haha so funny" I had my fair share of girlfriends and feeling codependent because I wanted to be apart of a secondary family I got attached to other families and all and then my parents as I get to this age all of a sudden want to love me and support me in sport and such and I just pushed it away I didnt want it from them Dont get me wrong home life isnt horrible I just dont feel the love I feel that I should for my parents like others do I dont get homesick nor do I care about a lot that happens in my family I care more about my friends and over the last year 19 now I have started to not even want to spend time around my friends I just really love living my life alone I go to work I workout I eat healthy but I love doing things in my life alone I find so much personal comfort in everything I do but only when I am alone I have just re acquired a girlfriend I used to date and I do love her but I barely want to spend a night with her a week because I think my sleep is a very personal thing my routines my life when I wake up when I sleep what I eat where I go what I do and I am so afraid that it will be like this because I really want to have someone I love with me I really want to start a family and have kids I crave everything about that type of life but I cant help but feeling that I am falling away from that due to my experiences through my life and even though I am 19 I feel as if some of these years and feelings will carry into my adult life I dont know if i am being overdramatic but I guess I would rather put it out for people to read over the internet then telling the people i trust closest to me in real life', 633059)
(" Context: I am fairly new to San Diego moved last year and admit that I’m not as security conscious I am also very new to the neighborhood moved in April I often see online posts about people breaking into cars but I live in a quiet part of the neighborhood in a culdesac where everybody knows each otherI have two cars One is a SUV I park on the street and the other is a sedan that I park in the garage Before I moved to the house in Talmadge I was living in an apartment complex where I had to share a parking space with a neighbor Because of this I left a spare valet key in the center compartment for the neighbor so she can move the SUV When we moved to the house I forgot to take the valet key out Also I tend to forget to lock the passenger door that has a broken actuatorStory: At 5:15 this morning I was in my garage getting ready to go to the gym As the garage door opened I heard the engine whirring of my SUV which doesn't make sense because I live alone Then I saw my car drive past my driveway I couldn't believe it but someone was driving off with my carSo I jumped into my sedan and started driving down Lucille and caught up with the SUV The driver turned around and started driving back towards my house I was able to look at the driver as she passed by I honked and turned around to followThe car turned onto Lorraine I approached slowly after I turned to follow Around the curve I saw that the car was parked By this time I was already with 911 dispatcher on the phone I kept my distance and realized that the car had been abandoned In about a minute the woman who was previously driving the SUV came around from the side of a house with a key in her hand She wasn’t holding a weapon and she had tight fitting clothes so I wasn’t as alarmed She walked to my passenger window and dangled the keys I lowered the window and she handed me the key She said that her friend gave her the keys to use the car which was a made up story and she was trying to make it sound like everything was square between us and that I should leave her alone She was unkempt I was not close enough to know if she smelled of alcohol Her speech was coherent There were leaves in her hair She was barefoot Big bellyShe started walking away and I followed her in the car She was trying to hide in the bushes of my neighbor’s houses and eventually gave up trying to hide from me when I persisted Then she ran down Lucille and entered through the fence of an empty house that is for sale 4778 Lucille Dr As she entered I saw that there was another person behind the wooden doorI sat and kept watch for 10 minutes when the police cruisers showed up They entered the property thru the same gate and came back out in 20 minutes but couldn’t find her initially They searched the neighborhood for another 20 minutes and found a person matching my description again trying to hide in another neighbor’s bush They said that they would like for me to ID her and if I did she would be going to jail They did say she claimed to be pregnant I know there are a lot of “law and order” people out there who would judge me for saying this but I don’t think a child should be born in such circumstances At the same time I also felt the she is a person who needed a lot of help I know things are far from perfect but I tell people that we need to trust the system to do its thing I decided that I should ID her and follow track of what happens to her and if she really is pregnant then I will have to figure out what happens to the baby when it is bornIt was the first time sitting in the back of a police car The officer drove me to the place where the woman was being held I identified her The other person who was behind the fence was not under arrest I would guess that he was the boyfriend and potentially the father if she really was pregnant I had mixed feelings about him too On one hand he might be a vagrant and thief But on the other hand he is sticking around because he didn’t want to abandon her despite there being bunch of law enforcement officers I just wanted to make sure I remember what he looked like because he certainly knows where I liveThe officer drove me back to where my SUV was I signed a couple of papers and got a case number He was well past his shift hour but stayed to make sure everything was in order He shook my hand and went home I was all alone in the street with my two carsI shuffled the cars back to my house less than 1000 feet I put both cars in the garage this time I was bummed out because I missed the workout session with my buddy I closed the garage door and decided that I should write this down somewhere while my memory of the whole event is still fresh in the membraneCrime lesson: I started working out just this week and I had been leaving the house around 4:50 every morning Today happened to be a late start because my workout buddy had schedule changes The exact moment I opened the garage was when that woman began to drive off I know the car would have been gone on any other day but today I only drive SUV to haul things from Costco every few weeks and don’t look at it every day So had the car been gone I wouldn’t have figured out the car was gone until the afternoon Or maybe the next day The car isn’t insured for theft and isn’t worth more than 4k It wouldn’t have been a big financial blow but it would have been upsetting and time consuming as I would have to look for another car I was lucky today I need to install security cameras to alert me on my phone I have legitimate excuses to buy more toys now and don’t have to feel guilty about spending time on tinkering around the house YayMeditation: It has been a crazy monthMy second child was born overseas less than a month ago and I have yet to go see her because of my obligations I’m a physician and take care of sick patients My practice does not allow for coverage as of now My wife and I are estranged and do not see eye to eye I have been contemplating divorce for many weeks now because I did not think I had it in me to sustain the relationship anymoreI was fired from my contractor position last week and I had been hustling a metric ton of the entrepreneurial grit to get my company off the ground with zero outside capital The old company I worked for is ran by bullies on a flawed model and can never be competitive on their own merit So the only way they know how to control their interest is through coercion which means lawyers get involved People who have been through this know it gets stressful even if you have nothing to hide and is on the right side of the lawI am not exactly a superstitious person but I feel like this car theft was a turning point in my eternal effort to do the right thing and persevere In the middle of all this madness while the police officers were running through backyard of my neighbors to find this woman my wife sent me a txt from overseas For the first time in our relationship she apologized for the the way she had been behaving and recognizes that our marriage cannot survive without her getting some help So I think maybe just maybe I don’t have to get a divorce and become a single dad while juggling a very busy medical practice of my own I told her that I would get back to her because I was talking to police officers I’ve yet to talk to her againNow it’s 8:30 as I write this It’s been 3 hours since this whole ordeal started I am typing this on my laptop sitting on the couch in my quiet family room with a mountain of toys my wife had bought for my son I am going through this hot press of coffee asking myself what happened this morning What harm did I sufferI still have the SUV I still have my life My son and daughter are healthy and happy My wife recognizes that I can’t be the only person who tries to keep the family together and is willing to work on herself from now on I signed 4 contracts for my practice last week with 4 more in the pipeline next week I brought on a new employee purely through reputation I started seeing patients under my own company name this week Somehow I squeezed honey and milk out of a rockThen it dawned on me The only thing I lost out on was the work out So I’m going to finish this coffee and make sure I lock all the doors and windows around the house Then I’m going to go hit the gym and press the reset button on the dayThanks for reading this long long story Have a nice day and remember to say hello to your neighbors I have reported this information to the police", 633056)
('My Dad my best friend my hero died a couple of weeks ago I have so many thoughts in my mind that take their turn every other minute My own mind has left me numb and confused I have seemingly blocked it all out and it feels like I’m pretending that he’s still alive and that everything is okay and just how it used to be but I know it’s not   I wish I could feel the pain of it so that I can get through it and move on but my mind won’t allow it I have small increments of time where I will cry but swiftly it shuts off I can look at pictures of him and feel nothing a lot of the time that I do It feels like I won’t allow myself to remember and feel how much I loved and still love him   If I feel anything at all it’s fear I’m more afraid to fail at anything now than ever in my life I know I suck at my job right now and am not a pleasant person to be around I’m not angry or mean just somewhere elseexhausted and tired and agitated at how noisy and ongoing the world is If I could be anywhere right now through all of this it’d be a pitch black void with no sound all by myself I can’t escape the world and I feel I need to do that in order to process what has happened   My life had been pretty stressful before I lost my Dad so this was the sledgehammer that drove the spike already piercing me Last year at the end of October my girlfriend37 and her two children 11f and 12m moved in with me at my home where I had previously lived by myself We’ve been together now 2 years and 2 months It’s been rocky We met right after she had divorced from a cheating spouse so things were rocky with her emotions and we were back and forth a bit She had decided to move home with her family close to Chicago stayed a couple of months and then decided to move with me Our original plan was to live there for a while save money and purchase a new home that was bigger Two months later around December out of nowhere decided to move with just her children Her reason was space and “time to heal” Our relationship suffered tremendously We no longer slept in the bed together kissed said “I love you”anything for a while   I thought the relationship would be completely finished once she moved She had already purchased a house and waiting for the closing date Oddly as the time drew closer things got better She began saying I love you sleeping in the bed with me etc Suddenly one day not long after that I lost my grandmother on my Dad’s side from a massive heart attack She didn’t attend visitation or the funeral A few weeks later my Dad passed from the same ailment She was there for me and was supportive went to the funeral etc   Already having bought the house and waiting for the closing date she begins to ask if I wanted to move with her I agreed after some thinking but it’s hard to think after loosing your family members especially your Dad  We’ve unpacked painted etc and she plans on “us” living there for about 3 years and moving again once the kids begin high school It’s just such odd behavior to me that now all of a sudden she’s all in We all live together and I haven’t sold my house yet because I’m terribly afraid to What if she gets flaky again I feel angry toward her because of her awful timing I don’t need to change anymore than What’s already changed in my life And now the kids the two pets and any other noise just aggravates me She almost expects me to be in a good mood or goofy and happy like I usually am every day but I can’t and it honestly makes me feel bad that I can’t I’ve always been a person that puts himself last and tends to others I don’t know how to properly take care of myself I don’t sleep well anymore and am just completely exhausted but I’m afraid that if I take time to myself and be to myself and put me first that she and others will think less of me or break up with me whatever Truly I’m lost on what to do I want to be with her but want to be to myself at the same time   On top of all that I have a nightmare situation between my Dad’s family including my Sister and Dad’s wife and her family They’re both at severe odds thinking one is going to get the upper hand on the other or take assets Tensions are high and I’m doing my absolute best playing peace keeper and moral compass as I’ve been named executor of the estate through Dad’s will I cannot fail at this I have to protect my family and the property owned by our family for generations and all of its assets   Everyone in my life has not the slightest inclination or care of how bad off my mind and well being is right now Everyone around me just wants and wants and takes and takes and expects and expects No one has asked me how I amnot once and I don’t want a pity party nothing like that but it’d be nice to know someone cares or took just a minute   I’m not suicidal but I really have no desire to wake up anymore My life has turned into a complicated mess of chaos and work and then more chaos I’m 32 now and feel like I’m 80 I wish I could take a long vacation awayhaven’t had one in 11 years with a big ass bag of weed Sorry for the length', 632091)
("A few months ago I [21F] went through this tinder phase after going through a painful breakup I had only been in two relationships and both ended with them cheating on me As a result I became very disappointed with the idea of dating and decided to explore my options I live in a college town so I wanted to give apps like Tinder/Bumble a shot I had a couple of ONS and eventually met this guy let's call him Ted who became my FWB We had really hot sex and got along just fine The relationship was strictly sexual we would only text each other to arrange a meeting time to hang out; whenever I tried to make more conversation by cracking a joke etc he would just leave me on read I didn’t mind since we were just FWBWe would have small conversation which mostly centered around him; he was a senior so he would tell me about his plans for the future jobs he was applying to etc I would just listen and give some input now and then this wasn't my first rodeo so I knew that in order to make this FWB thing work I had to be kind of cold/distant He wouldn't ask me any questions about myself either so it worked out just fineTed would mostly just come over we would smoke some weed and then go into my room This arrangement continued for months sometimes he would disappear for two or three weeks but I wouldn't trip because we weren't exclusive and as I said I was also seeing other people Eventually I met this dude who I got into a brief relationship with After being MIA for a couple of weeks Ted texted me and asked if I wanted to hang out to which I replied that I had had lots of fun with him but I had met someone He took it pretty well and we both went our separate ways However things did not workout with the other guy and essentially went back to hooking up with Ted At first I was kind of hesitant to hit up Ted again since I had in a way curved him but then my friends reminded me that he was just a tinder boy and he was just trying to get laid I still felt kind of bad because nobody wants to be a rebound but I just wanted to have some fun LolSurprisingly Ted took it pretty well and even asked me about it when we met up He asked me what had happened and why things didn’t work out with the other dude It was nice being able to talk about it with him Matter of fact we started to talk about more personal things before/after hooking up since that talk happened; I finally started telling him things about me he would ask me if I got along with my parents etcI didn’t think much of it tbh I thought it was only fair to start sharing things about me since I mostly kept to myself during our meetings We had had this respectful friendship between us but I felt as though our friendship developed even further; instead of cordial catching up we would talk about how we dealt with emotions/feelings/etc It was nice to have such a sensitive FWB I really admired him for the ways he handled thingsBut here is where it gets tricky him and I go to the same university and would sometimes see each other on campus I had say hi to him once when I saw him However I noticed he would never greet me when he saw me Even if we had made eye contact he would just continue walking and not say hello I won’t lie this really bothered me because how can someone come to your house eat your food smoke your weed have sex with you and not even have the decency to acknowledge your existence in publicFeeling like someone’s ashamed of you/keeping you a secret really sucks I wasn’t expecting him to greet me with a hug or any of that bs a simple nod would’ve sufficed but to right up ignore me really hurt It made me feel as though I was less than him and I wasn’t even worthy of basic human acknowledgement I felt like nothing more than a piece of meatThis happened more than once we would run into each other and he would just ignore me Sometimes we’d make eye contact and I would try to wave hello but he would turn before I could I was hurt confused and knew that this was not good for my selfesteemSo I decided to remove him from my social media and life We followed each other on Instagram and Snapchat; I figured that if he didn’t care enough to acknowledge my existence in real life then why should he get to see what where I’m going/what I’m doing with my life He texted me the next day asking me if I wanted to hangout and I just ignored his textIn other words I ghosted him And this is what I’m struggling with I feel incredibly shitty for ghosting someone because I’ve been ghosted myself and know that it sucks I figured he’s graduating soon so it really doesn’t matter cause I’m not gonna see him again I still feel like an asshole for ghosting him though", 628936)
('I\'ve loved a girl for over 11 years in my life I met her back when I was attending Senior Kindergarten at Our Lady of Lourdes in Toronto Ontario I was around 6 at the time I was not in a good place at the time My family and I struggled with finances when we freshly migrated to Canada We were homeless in the beginning my parents would often argue amongst each other with things related to work and finances I remember running away whenever a fight would arise meanwhile my older sister would try to mediate things between the two adults My older brother sat by and in times would also help mediate the arguments I ran away Whether it he physically isolating myself and covering my ears praying to God for an answer or just resorting to a daydream about something so surreal I did those things I couldn\'t ever face the consequences and the reality  it was too much of a burden for me I remember my first day of school I was crying I had no friends and I often found myself alone for the most part I would simply wall around daydream and not say a word I was profusely shy and afraid I often got bullied by the other boys in my batch I was labelled as \'gay\' and had labelled me with insults around my name I had a friend for some time She was nice Her name was Vicky She was very attracted to me and loved to give me kisses and pinch my cheeks One day when we were on the bus home we were beaten up A boy decided to hit us in the back of the bus and I remember she was crying in tears whereas I I stopped crying I just stopped feeling for a moment and let it happen When she got out of her stop I remember her crying to her grandmother holding her shoulder The boy who was hitting us stopped his name was Matthew I watched from the window of the bus and I saw the resentment in her eyes When my bus stop was near I remember wiping away my tears and continuing the day as if nothing had happened I knew if I was caught crying my babysitter would have asked me and told my parents I was afraid of causing a commotion so I remember vividly I told myself "Hold it in be strong I have to be strong" Following that day I was alone once more Vicky stopped hanging out with me and was disgusted by my lack of confidence To an extent she held me responsible for what happened that day Then I met her It was senior kindergarten at that time My mom was late picking me up so I tagged along with my homeroom teacher I was the last person to get home from the morning class I was left in her classroom playing with the Legos and toys at the time My homeroom teacher came and introduced her to me "Godwin this is Jessany" "Jessany this is Godwin" I was extremely shy I quickly took a glance at her face She was beautiful I remember what took place after We were both sitting passing each other the Lego pieces We just played in the same room I remember looking at the time feeling the perfect serenity and quietness of the room praying to God that my Mom comes to pick me up a bit later I was catching feelings and I hadn\'t known I had no friends so it felt like I was understood in that short quiet period of time Grade 1 came and I was eager to have a class with her but I didn\'t I was hoping to find her see her talk to her but she was in another class So every time recess came by I would innocently stalk her If not I was just wondering around the playground and school thinking about life About school About the future I was lost in my head One day I confessed to a boy named Loriell that I liked Jessany He teased me and bullied me about it There was a girl who liked me at the time her name was Joanna She was very jealous and well before I know it I made one more enemy Loriell decided to bring her up to me and confess my feelings to her publicly Ugh In a mocking tone he was saying "Godwin likes Jessanny Godwin likes Jessanny" To her reply she said: "Stop it Loriell that isn\'t nice" She gave him a stern look and shooed him away She then smiled back at me and said "it would be okay"I couldn\'t say anything I ran away I didn\'t say thank you I just couldn\'t face her It was the first time I\'ve witnessed someone do something for me To stand up for I\'ve loved you ever since I moved from away from Ontario to British Columbia the following year And ever since I\'ve yearned for her I daydreamed about her I was obsessed and I didn\'t even know it Every field trip I had in school I was constantly feeding my optimism anticipating that I would find her it killed somedays Some days I found myself praying to God to get her out of head some days I prayed to God to bring her to me Unconsciously she became an image and representation of my intuition I cried countless times rejected many girls finding myself feel "empty" and alone I would often daydream her being by my side in an open field having a deep conversation about life Talking about love Talking about our dreams I want to happy I\'m tired of crying and hoping to see her I\'ve accepted the reality in which she does not know this she does not remember me and that my love is completely UnrequitedThis year I pursued a relationship I fell deeply in love I gave my everything I put all my wisdom and knowledge I learned from my previous love Jessany into this relationship It was not enough I gave all my attention to my Ex My ex was a lot like me I tried to give her the advice I "imagined" Jessany would give me I gave her patience and lived true to my word I opened up about my feelings for Jessany to my ex she couldn\'t accept it She had felt that she was competing against a ghost She never was I loved Maggie with my heart The feeling of lost and tears are coming back to me I\'m back to my Habits falling for Jessany all over again I never expected to be cheated on to be lied to to be disrespected It absolutely hurts It hurts more to continue to daydream about Jessany I\'m 18 now I\'ve constant battled with trying to forget Jessany and move on  I tried to live by my Exes\' principle\'s being in the moment replacing someone else But it\'s not right  It hurt me to try and choose to love someone like my Ex and how at the end of the day I\'m still back to the same spot I wish I can move on and forgive my ex But deep inside I find myself blaming Jessany for this Even though I know she\'s not the one to blame I am frusturated I\'m in a very delicate place right now I\'m back to isolation and I hope one day I can find happiness One day I can solve these inner demons I loved you Jessanny and you didn\'t even knowI loved you Maggie and you didn\'t even know I gave you wisdom and knowledge that you apply in your life and you don\'t even know But I guess that\'s what love is To choose to give love despite getting nothing return I\'m constantly breaking myself for people Talking to people much older than me can get tiring Some days I wish I can meet someone my age who actively tries to understand my position Unrequited love sucks', 628468)
('Hello everybodyI feel hesitant to even write post this because it is about a shameful secret that only a handful of people know of yet I carry it around with me everyday  It is my darkest secret and my biggest regret and I do not know when I will make peace with it but hopefully sharing this is a start&amp;#x200B;So from the beginningI was born to a White father and an Asian mother making me halfAsian or a HAPA as some people call it and growing up I never thought of myself as Asian  I believe this is because I identified with my father as a child and thought of myself as basically White  In fact I thought I looked White enough whereas people would not realize that I was Asian at all  However this was not the case  Beginning in middle school and throughout high school I got teased for being Asian  This was not something I was emotionally ready for for whatever reason; I would get extremely upset for being made fun of and I felt ugly and began to resent the Asian part of myself I would cry by myself and be very fearful of social interaction due to the fear of people not liking me because of my raceAnd I believe I had such a hard time adjusting because of the fact that my father was white and I couldn\'t identify with or relate to him seeing how I was an Asian looking male and he was a White male  And because of this I never confided in him what I was going through since I did not know how he could possibly help me  I also never confided in my mother because she was a woman and I was a man  Basically I felt very isolated even from my own parents and felt too embarrassed and ashamed of myself to share with others what I was going through  For example when I was 14 I saw a psychologist for one session due to social anxiety and he asked me "if there was one thing that you wished that would make your life better what would it be"  I knew what I really thought that if I was White my life would be better  But I lied and told him I wish I were rich too embarrassed to tell him the truthThings escalated when I was 15 years old  I don\'t remember how I came across it but I found something online about a cosmetic procedure called Blepharoplasty  It\'s a surgical procedure that removes fat from above the patient\'s eyelids to make his or her eyes seem bigger  It is also known as double eyelid surgery which if the patient has monolids gives the patient a visible crease where the eyelid folds in  Many Asians have monolids giving a more closed look than somebody with double eyelids  Anyways I had monolids and thought that if I got this procedure done to me I would look more White and less Asian thus being a solution to my selfhatred and fear of social interaction at this point in my life I was extremely depressed and overly distrustful of the world  I told my Dad that I wanted the surgery and that the reason I wanted it was because of cosmetic reasons I didn\'t tell him I wanted to look less Asian  I told him that I wanted less fat above my eyes  Well after consulting with a doctor near where we lived that did this sort of procedure a date was scheduled for me to undergo the surgery  So right after I turned 16 I went through with the surgery  The surgery itself and the aftermath went without a hitch  There were no complications just time required to heal the wounds afterwardsNow the reason why this bothers me so much even though the scars are basically invisible on my eyelids and it\'s been nearly 10 years since the surgery is because I feel like a fraud  I feel extremely shameful that my face today is "unnatural" even if the difference from before and after the surgery would be unnoticeable to most people  I still feel the scar lumps under the skin where cut was made  I still feel the weight of holding onto this secret I lied to my friends and people at my school after the surgery explaining that I got an infection in both eyelids due to wearing goggles while swimming  Most of my friends today don\'t know about this I fear how they might judge me  In fact I have only told one friend   Sometimes I think that maybe this is not such a big deal  I mean it\'s not like I got a transgender surgery  I only changed my eyes but it still haunts me even to this day for whatever reason  I\'ve even accepted God\'s help on the matter and maybe this is His way of helping by giving me the motivation and capacity to write this on the internet  I am also trying to forgive my parents for what had happened  Yes it was my idea but I believe my father and/or mother should have prohibited me from undergoing a permanent alteration to my face at such a young age especially during my depressed and anxious state that my parents were well aware ofSo I don\'t know how people are going to take this on here  It feels weird to share something so personal online to a bunch of random strangers  Maybe ya\'ll will tell me this isn\'t a big deal at all  Maybe you will  I don\'t know  I\'m not even really looking for advice just honest feedback  But any genuine responses are appreciated\\One final note: the surgery did NOT make things better for me  People still made fun of me for being Asian I realize now that there\'s nothing wrong with being Asian and I was still anxious and depressed  I do feel calmer now that I\'m older but this past of mine always comes creeping back into my mind to really f\' with me  Also I\'m not ugly I\'ve been told that I was good looking before and after the surgery in case anyone was wondering', 627350)
('I feel like making this account and using it as a source to express how I feel at the moment would be a good idea so I’m a guy I’m 20 hi lol I graduated high school about 2 years ago and I completely cut myself off from almost about everyone I knew at the time and still a little to this day see it as me “branching off on my own and finding a better group of people to be around” and I’ve honestly always wished for that to happen sometimes towards the end of high school I sort of just cut loose and ran I don’t know if anyone has anything similar but that goes into my second partCurrently I’m still living in the same town still with my family and although they are supportive and loving as ever I also have my older sister here I know they would be happier if I were to move out and start my own life something I think a lot of parents would want for their child but I recently made the mistake of dropping out of college I was going to a nice community college a little bit out of town from where I am now just to open myself up to fresh faces and in a weird way reinvent myself but as time went on and I of course started working I just snapped and completely shut off from everything now I did go through a heavy I would say depressive episode which I really don’t want to go on here right now or I’ll be here forever So ever since I dropped out of college I’ve of course have a job which is great because I at least feel like me having money and helping my parents out is a huge part as to why I’m still here but it’s a very mundane job and I do plan on leaving once I find something better possibly in the next few months  The one good thing that came out of my “depressive” episodeand I mean that in the lightest way I’ve never been diagnosed and I do have family members who have gone through it so I don’t mean to piss off people who deal with actual depression because that shits rough and I really don’t mean to offend anybody but that was the darkest time of my life and I still feel like I’m facing the tail end of that and I don’t know any other way to describe itwas that I did find something that I am really passionate about or atleast think is a great direction for me and that has to do with art not necessarily physical art but more so graphic and animations etc I really don’t want to say much because I want to say as anonymous as I can for now——————————————————————————So that’s thatSo that was a shit tonI’m just going to simplify it into main points if anyone wasn’t  able to read through that if they can I wouldn’t blame you if you can’t i sound very woe is me right now and I might regret this later •How do I push myself out there to be more sociable again I’ve always been the “friend of” or “ so and so’s friend” I want to create an identity for myself with a whole new group of people it’s gotten to a point where I can talk to someone but it’s sort of obvious I’m forcing myself to the point where I am either stuttering over my words or will just sit in complete silence if I don’t know what to say•How do I find a good group of people to surround myself with and actually feel like I am worth something to them yikes I know that last part is a doozy and takes some internal shit I know•How do I stop reliving all the cringey or embarrassing things I’ve done in the past when they were well over 2 almost 3 years ago and I am a completely different person•And lastly and I hope this doesn’t turn this whole post into a joke but I really need advice on this how do I word a financial aid reinstatement letter in my case like I see all of these examples where they have valid reasons  a death in a family a accident but I don’t have any of those I just snapped I shut down completely and just fell into a hole that I can’t seem to get out ofSo there it is this honestly just scratches the surface and I chose to gloss over a lot of stuff but if this does get some sort of response I will definitely try to talk about those issues and other things in depth I really don’t want people to think I’m some “sad boi” I love having discussions and love debating topics with people I love art and music and history and just so many things I’d love to use this reddit account as a way to show some of that stuff  and maybe make a few reddit buds but yeah PS I do want to cover a few quick things I might possibly get in response 1 I don’t feel comfortable talking to my parents this deeply about stuff when it comes to this situation they are hard working people and are dealing with a lot when it comes to other family issues and I absolutely do not want to let them in on this as this time not only that it’s super uncomfortable for me to do so since I’ve never been this open to anyone ever2 A therapist is something I’d likely do in the future but for now I’d like to do a little self reflection and sort myself out a bit morePSS I’m a very self analyzing person so I’ve had a lot of time to think about this and it’s something I do on a constant basis I don’t want this to be one big sad post I’m actually very hesitant but happy I’m posting this for the slight chance someone might see this and we could connect

('Trigger Warning: ED mention &amp;#x200B;I suffer from severe anxiety and depression OCD and bipolar disorder and used to self harm Whenever I met my boyfriend it was nice to find someone who would actually listen to me instead of telling me that I was making it up for attention or that it wasn\'t so bad My mom and family didn\'t understand me my classmates told me that I was making my OCD up for a school assignment and in tenth grade I had a mental breakdown for a week straight IN CLASSES because my classmates told me to "go home and kill myself" "go home and cut myself" and that "the world would be better off if I didn\'t exist" One of them apologized to me at the end of the year and even hugged me but the others didn\'t really acknowledge it past the tenth grade and just assumed we were okay all the way through graduation Those comments really stuck with me but I kept my depression hidden except for when I was finally put on anti depressants in tenth grade and I did a lot of switching of medications So I would really just discuss it with my doctor I went to a therapist but she really wasn\'t that much help I wouldn\'t see another therapist until my Freshmen year of college and then not again until my Senior year of college She just tried to teach me breathing techniques as I was having a melt down in her office It was terrible &amp;#x200B;I just felt like my boyfriend really was there for me and he was: he was incredibly supportive he made sure that I was okay and  he held me and let me cry in his arms for hours on end My depression worsened the summer before my Freshmen year of college and due to a pregnancy scare and I had developed mrsa omg that was the grossest/most painful experience of my life I developed an eating disorder I thought that I was bulimic but I was actually anorexic with bulimia tendencies which just fueled my depression even further Whenever we would hang out in his room I would just have a mental breakdown and cry and cry I would shake and bawl uncontrollably and I expected my boyfriend to pick up the pieces &amp;#x200B;I was toxic I would call his house just to talk to him if I hadn\'t heard from him in a while I was always text bombing him Yes I know that this was toxic behavior and I can\'t blame it all on my mental illness but I\'m taking accountability for my actions and realizing that I was a piece of garbage I didn\'t have any "friends" outside of my boyfriend and would get upset if he wanted to hang out with friends over me I even cried whenever he got a job It was ridiculous His parents didn\'t want me to be over there during the week a lot during school but on the weekends it was fair game and I couldn\'t even handle that I thought that they hated me but in reality they just wanted to make sure that the both of us were getting our school work done &amp;#x200B;I was constantly breaking promises I was expecting him to do all the work in every aspect of our relationship I wasn\'t showing him any affection but craved his attention It was just bad all around&amp;#x200B;I wasn\'t eating I was over exercising to the point where I almost passed out in the bathroom of the gym before my Spanish class I would rely on him for everything One day about a year ago or maybe six months ago I\'m not quite sure we had a blow up fight We\'ve had blow up fights before and I would punch a wall or go purge or fucking cry and expect him to just forgive me But this was different He had told me that he had finally had enough and told me everything that I was doing I was shocked We had a fight over the phone and then a conversation in his car but we ultimately decided that we loved each other and that we both needed to work on things &amp;#x200B;And it\'s beengreat I\'m not just saying that because "everyone wants a happy ending" It truly has been great Wonderful even We voiced our concerns and issues with one another and it worked out I went back to therapy and my therapist really identified the core reasons for my issues ya girl got diagnosed with bipolar disorder woo She gave me advice on how I could use the techniques that I was learning in therapy to bring them to my relationship and they worked I\'ve become more affectionate more loving more caring and working on letting things go I\'ve made more friends even if they\'re just work friends and let go of relationships that were toxic to me I got in touch with my doctor about my eating disorder and she\'s helping me through that He even gave me a promise ring and says "we\'re basically married" We\'re moving in together by August &amp;#x200B;I just wanted to make this post because I\'ve never really told anyone about this part of my life I was a horrible girlfriend and person for 25 years and I never want to get to that low of a point in my life again I\'m just hoping that if someone reads this they too can benefit from it', 622601)
('Using a throwaway So this all started when my first high school boyfriend dumped me This club water polo coach reached out to me because my performance during practice dropped due to this emotionally hard time in my life He offered me support and guidance which I appreciated But it soon turned into suggestive messages and shirtless pictures of him The naive me thought it was playful flirting and took it as a sign that my HOT 25 year old coach thought I was pretty So when it came to practice we would scrimmage for the last part of practice During this time he started getting in the pool with us and playing and would always guard me He would grind up on me and rub my clit through my swim suit He would grab my hips with both hands and overall harass me in the water But what was I supposed to do I just let it happen over and over Fast forward to over two months of him assaulting me like that he texted me saying he wanted to talk about college water polo So I agreed and drove downtown to find out the address he sent me was a hotel As soon as I got out of my car he met me outside and gave me a huge hug and smiled which made me feel comfortable In my mind I was thinking he wanted to talk about recruiting for playing water polo in college We go up to his room and immediately he grabs me and kisses me Then tells me to slow down I remember my whole face becoming red and not knowing what to do He then poured me half a glass of Makers Mark and told me to drink it all So I did because I was 16 and submissive and just took his directions Then he all of a sudden had a visible massive boner and just pointed to it and said you know what to do I remember freezing and he unzipped his pants and grabbed my head and just throat fucked me Mind you I have fucking braces and this guy totally doesn’t care I remember my eyes watering and basically crying the whole time and he just didn’t care and kept calling me beautiful As I was doing that he pulled down my tank top to my waist and took off my bra In my mind I knew what he was going to do but I couldn’t stop him since he was 6’ 3 220 pounds He then took off all my clothes and grabbed a box of Trojans from his bag He then asked how many people I’ve had sex with and I replied one So he threw the box across the room and said “hop on this dick” I remember backing away saying I’ve never had sex without a condom and he told me it felt much better and I would cum a lot harder He got off the bed walked over to me and picked me up put me on the bed and started having his way with me He is a huge guy with a huge dick and I remember feeling absolutely ripped open His dick was just stretching me out to the point of tears he just kept fucking me harder and faster About two minutes in he goes “tell me how old you are” and I said sixteen he already knew this Then he said say repeat this “you like fucking my tight sixteen year old pussy” so I repeated it He got such an evil look in his eye and kept telling me to repeat it while choking me with his massive hand wrapped around my neck He then pulled out and came all over my face without telling me he was going to do that Immediately told me to go get cleaned up so I did came back out to put clothes on and he told me to keep my clothes off “Round two is soon baby” I remember being so scared of what would happen I got nauseas and wanted to find an excuses to leave but couldn’t He fucked me again and again and again and came on me again and again and again After the fourth time I couldn’t walk He would lay me down and just run his hands up and down my body telling me how special I was and that I was his little secret He said I made him “feel different than girls his age” but I knew he just wanted sex He then poured me another glass of Makers Mark and told me to drink it and I did At this point I am drunk because I never drink So he proceeds to fuck me again up against the wall then doggy style then while picking me up entirely cause I was so weak And the last time he came inside of me because he asked if I was on the pill and I said I was He had raw sex with me seven times that night From around 8pm to about 4 or 5 in the morning just sex Then told me it was a new record of his I collapsed on the bed and he told me he really liked me and we should do this again I felt so cold on the inside So violated and sick I felt as if I couldn’t move or talk and wouldn’t be able to for awhile It’s so hard even typing about this and talking about it I just want to be able to reverse time and tell myself don’t go there don’t subject yourself to that don’t trust people easily Why couldn’t I say no in the moment and just freeze up because he was extremely attractive Why did I think he was a good guy Why can’t I stop thinking about it a few years later It sucks but this is my truth and it’s finally off my chest and I feel so much better at least telling someone about itThe sad thing is he still coaches club women’s water polo And now he has a girlfriend his age I wonder how she would react to thisI wonder if he ever thinks about me and is sorry for what he did', 622347)

('This has been going on for more than 34 years I\'m afraid of everything I\'m afraid of girls I\'m afraid of someone liking me and I\'m most definitely afraid of myselfSo about 1 week ago I reactivated my Tinder accountAfter deactivating it for more than 5 times in the past I saw no notifications I did some swiping and still got no luck so I deleted my account then I created a whole new account so I could get more chances I swiped and I swiped and I swiped like crazynot necessarily on every one of them well I had and have no luck so I deleted the account once againalthough I wanted someone to match me I was also scared of having to interact with someone "What if they don\'t message me first okay I will do the honors theneven if they actually like my lookswhat if I say something wrong that will throw them off or what if I\'m not confident enough what if they see through my facade or they might find someone betterSo I deleted it but before I deleted the damn fucking thingI memorized the looks of some girls I really likedthen my mind automatically started building up face structures of some males that I haven\'t met or don\'t know what they looked like and I imagined those males actually being with the girls I liked I sat there for 5 minutes thinking about what others get while I miss out on everything and I got sad I frequently do that but it\'s nothing to worry outI took some time to think about it all how I\'m too afraid to do anything how I can\'t even start a conversation with a girl let alone get laid sometimes I\'m even afraid to say something in publicI remember couple of times being in a public transport and I was afraid of saying "stop right here"which cost me at least 2 bus stops in my country there aren\'t only bus that can be used for transport I was diagnosed with depression in February this year but I think I might have ADHD and social anxiety too because I can\'tI repeat I cannot function everything is out of my league every girl every game and every human being  I feel worthless to even stand somewhere where productive people areyes that\'s a major symptom of depressionselfloathing A friend of mine was talking about some girl he was banging and showed me a pic of him and that girl naked in his apartment I started like "Aha that\'s my man she\'s cute mate" and acted as if I was some kind of a macho myself but deep inside I thought to myself "Okay let\'s pretend we get lots of it too but whom are you lying to you can lie to someone who doesn\'t know about your private life but you most definitely know you ain\'t shit chicks for real dude grow the fuck up nobody wants to have anything with you every chick you know refused to have anything with you you destroyed everythingand now you act like you have pools of it fuck you"  I smiled but that was one of those "I\'m gonna smile so I don\'t look awkward" It\'s really tiring you know everything is hard for me sometimes I wonder "I\'m either too smart for this world or too dumb"How can a smart man not function at some degree that will make him happy even dumb ones achieve that what am I doing wrongI ask myself but I can\'t get to the answerTake a piece of paper and a pen in the top center of the paper I want you to put a dot with the pendid you do it that\'s how I look at my situation Top center dot refers to my goals the final destination finish line or whatever you want to call itnoticed there is no bottom dot which would replicate my beginning that\'s because I only see the destinationnot the road that leads to itThank you for reading I wanted to post this for so so long but once again you guessed it I was too afraid to do it', 621851)
('This is long so please bear with me I’m 21 F going to college in the upper Midwest I met this girl Let’s call her Amy We met Halloween of 2017 and I immediately thought she was different and cool The reason she’d came to the hangout was because my friend Will knew Amy’s boyfriend Darren Before I continue these are all fake names Duh Darren and Amy have been dating for 4 years now Anyways Amy and I started hanging out more when Summer 2018 rolled around We bonded quickly and flirted constantly I knew I didn’t have a chance She and Darren have a strong relationship It became a trend of getting drunk and flirting hard with one another She started talking about how she was not a fan of monogamy and wanted to explore her sexuality because she’s bi I was still very closeted at this point and she was the first person I ever told that about having a strong attraction towards women Before I go on at this point Amy had and continues to have a very difficult home life Her dad is an alcoholic and her mom and her aren’t close At that point she had basically been taking care of her father and had to put off going to school because of him She loves him and was incredibly dedicated to making sure he was safe Darren and his family have been her biggest support for the past 4 years helping her whenever she needs it She and Darren’s parents are close and have a great relationship that compensates for the relationship with her parents Back to me and her Amy and I continued hanging out and one night we decided to get a hotel room so we could drink and be loud I know it’s weird but to us it was a great fuckin idea It’s our moment We can let totally loose and drink a lot We do Things escalate she opens up to me about her family life more and how things have gotten harder She opens up about how she’s developed feelings for me I held her as she cried I’m going to take full responsibility I kissed her Things escalated Clothes came off but we didn’t go beyond kissing It was an exchange that can be best described as a release of pent up sexual energy It was the strongest I’ve ever felt for someone in a sexual situation I felt like I was on fire At the end it all she asked me to sleep in the other bed and her last words before we went to sleep were “I just cheated on Darren”I felt horrible I never wanted this to happen this way I didn’t want to make Amy feel guilty and now I carried a guilt that weighed on me for monthsAmy and I stopped speaking for about a 5 month period She was going through a really difficult time with her family and went off the radar only really talking to Darren During this period I went on a complete sex bender I lost my virginity a couple of weeks after the hotel and I went on to have multiple male sexual partners I was chasing a high It was patheticEventually she reached out and we started seeing one another again I apologized profusely and said that if I in any way took advantage of her in a time of weakness or sadness I would do anything I could to make up for itShe looked me dead in the eyes and said that she did not regret having that exchange with me and that she felt very strongly about me romantically I’m not gonna lie her looking at me and saying that made me giddy I have a total weakness for her We continued to hang out and I started exploring my sexuality more Things began falling into our old cycle: drinking and flirting I met a girl let’s call her Emily on tinder Emily and I got along well enough and she was nice to be around We had good chemistry and I liked talking to her For the first time ever I was dating a girl Really dating a girl It was casual and we were both still active on tinder but she would come over to my dorm  and we would watch movies and makeout Nothing crazy I thought it was going well I didn’t expect for the relationship to stretch much longer we got along alright but I have a weird craving for intense emotional connection and I could tell that the connection wasn’t at the level I wanted it to be and it wouldn’t get there Amy was still there She encouraged the relationship and said that she was proud of me for allowing myself to date a girl She told me she was jealous Then last Friday happened Amy and I were drinking and I honestly don’t remember how but we were cuddling which is super weird because neither of us like physical affection much and then we looked at each other and our lips met This time was different She kissed me and the exchange could be best described as sweet The next hour was a dance of kissing one another and talking During this talk I told her I loved her I didn’t even know I loved her until I said it She told me she loved me She tells me a shocking fact She has never orgasmed with Darren and that she’s allowed a little lie to go on for four years and now it felt huge and heavy in her heart She told me she doesn’t really enjoy sex with him but does it for his sake because she loves him The thing is I sympathized If I found a boy that I got along with so well and was there for me so unflinchingly and loyally I’d fake orgasms too But that’s a huge problem and in the future it’s going to be more pronounced I apologized again the next morning and she again said that she didn’t regret anythingI broke up with Emily the next day Now here we are We’re kind of in a silent agreement where we know how we feel about one another and constantly want to see each other When I broke up with Emily she told me she didn’t get off till 1 AM but would come over right after her shift We never hang out that late I had an 8 AM the next day but didn’t care We kissed again briefly that night I don’t know what to do Darren is an amazing guy and she clearly loves him and I can say with almost 100% certainty that she will not break up with him The only thing I can think of is to halt communication again but those months were some of the hardest of my life I don’t want to be a scum bag that fucks over a good guy who I also consider my friend just to get the girl I want If you’ve made it this far you deserve a medal Thank you Please don’t roast me too hard The journey to get to where I am had been a difficult one and I come from a home where I would be disowned if my parents found out about my sexuality Amy is the first person I’ve had this kind of connection with and I’m scared to leave it behind even though I’m fully aware it’s the right thing to do', 619493)
('First of all I\'m 20/M and from canada For not too long ago I lost a person in my life that was very important to me First I thought I can handle the situation but started to get really depressive After a time my mind brought a lot of things and mistakes I made in the past to me and made me chew on them Each new "thing" took me like a week to fully process  so I can start thinking about something normal again and enjoy my day a bit It didn\'t last long after a few days the next thing from my past would come up to my thoughts and start plague me If I wanted to think about anything else I really needed to concentrate I couldnt  smile once and cried alot that time But things got worse After I was done with "a couple of them" my mind would go further and make me believe things that aren\'t true Or I believed arent true For example that I leaked nude pics of myself to a stranger online I know Ive chatted with a couple of strangers but would never do that on porpuse so my brain made me believe the weirdest way how it happened But thats one of the more harmless storys I even felt responsible for the death of another person who died in a car accident  The way I leaked the pics is so unrealistic and kinda dumb and really not my way But because its so long ago I can never be a 100% sure I didnt do it if you know what I mean So I think thats what my brain wants me to feel Insecure Even when it sounds so dumb and stupid my mind repeats the story over and over again so that I start thinking its the truth because it\'s just impossible to prove wrong The only thing I have is my memory but when I try so hard to remember the truth I want to hear  I can think about nothing else All of this never bothered me all of this happened long time ago and I had a normal life after that and never any problems Didnt even realize these things as "Problems"  Maybe its all true and I\'m just realizing the small devastating Details now Anyway I could never change anything about it the only way I could be sure is if anything catches up with me So the best would be just continue living  But I\'m very scared of that because I couldnt handle to be responsible for another persons death  I dont know what to do anymore I hope anyone of you can help me in anyway I just want my old life back I just want this all to stop Everytime my mind repeats the storys it gets a little worse for me Its so hard to stop it I\'ve tried so much I\'m feeling like everybody hates me since I\'m so depressed and not doing anything then being for myself it took me alot to even write this down and make this public I dont know what else to do anymore I guess I feel like I\'m going Crazy I never had this before in my whole life If you have read this far thanks for taking your time and listening to me', 618967)
("Ever since I was little my parents have always tried to made a big deal out of birthdays Every year had a new theme or some big event tied into it and they really strived to make things special And they were Some of my best memories were from my birthdays as a kid; hanging out with cousins being surrounded by friends opening mountains of presents etc As I got older I became really socially withdrawn and it became harder and harder for me to connect with people My friend groups got smaller each year and I stopped going to family events Eventually I no longer felt comfortable having any birthday events 'cause everyone felt like acquaintances at best Birthdays also force me to reflect on the accomplishments I've made since the last one and I'm always disappointed in myself Every year I'd tell myself that this is the time you'll start that relationship make those friends go on that trip get that job improve your life Depression and anxiety always get the better of me though The lack of relationships romantic or otherwise is what gets me the most But my parents still try to make the day special which kinda makes me feel even worse They'll take me out to dinner and do a cake and give me a little gift or two I really appreciate them for it so I don't have the heart to tell them that their efforts go to wasteThis past year has been particularly difficult for me I've become so socially isolated that I don't know how talk to people anymore I don't feel like a person I'm coming to terms with the fact that I'm probably transgender too after coming out to myself dysphoria ended up hitting like a truck based on what I've heard being trans doesn't make dating life any easier and i dont imagine the process of transitioning working wonders on my self confidence i have a hard enough time putting myself out there already i also failed a ton of units this past semester and the college i was supposed to transfer to rescinded their offer im having a lot of doubts abput my major  cause of how much i suck this understandably hasnt made my parents the happiest and my relationship with them is rocky to say the least everything could have been prevented if i had just done better or taken more risks but i just didnt and it all piled up im just overwhelmed by all the aspects of my life that need fixing and im mad at myself for putting myself in this position i dont know if i can get out of this one ive attempted suicide before and i havent genuinely considered it for a while but i can feel the depression rotting away at my brain and the anxiety building up in my chest and im so scared that my birthday will be the breaking point just having those expectations of being the best time of your life and the last major milestone before whatever and not being able to live up to it i see people on social media living it up on their 21st and having crazy parties and i just know mine wont be like that and i feel bad im really scaredi have a plan though on my birthday ill distract myself the whole day ill wake up and go for a run or something maybe go to the mall and buy myself a genderaffirming outfit treat myself to some jewelry Then ill go see a movie i heard detective pikachu was a pretty good time and itll kill a couple hours i'll buy a new book and try reading in a coffee shop maybe a spa day or idk i hope i have enough distractions just to get through the day i hope it doesnt backfire and make me feel more alone than i usually do the goal is to just not stay in my room and let things fester as im reading this back to myself the whole thing sounds really silly i hope one day i can look back at this time in my life and be able to say im glad its over but i also know that the only way that will happen is if i make some changes real soon thank you if you made it this far sorry it was so long and all over the place i just wanted to vent any suggestions for getting through my bday are welcome i hope to see you soon", 618803)
('Please help me to understand I don’t want to be doomed to never get close to anyone  be candid and helpful I want to get help if I need it My boyfriend and I broke up and he called me a sociopath Here’s some of the reasons why  as best as I can record it without trying to lean one way or the other I lied to him about having an OKCupid account We were talking about being in an open relationship so I made the account I then asked him 2 days later what boundaries he’d like to set for our open relationship  and he said he couldn’t trust me so I turned away and never looked back I didn’t talk to anyone or message a bunch of people I only saw how many “likes” I had and checked it once a couple of weeks later to see how many more “likes” there were But I didn’t tell him about it  none the less I talked to other people in depth about subjects I enjoy Philosophy art work animals and I even asked about how those people were doing in life I also do this in person He takes this as getting emotionally attached to people so that in the future when he’s not around I’ll have someone to lean on Now I won’t kid myself I find these people attractive but I believe that I should be able to be open and friendly and be able to discuss these things with people as long as I don’t go into a realm of inappropriate comments things that are sexual in nature or secretive confessions etc I did not tell him I was talking to others in this fashion  but I didn’t see anything wrong with it since I didn’t get to those things that I deem inappropriate Examples below:THEM: Hey Michelle 🙂 it’s been awhile — hope you’re doing well these days and enjoying your workME: Well thank you I was surprised to see a message so early Haha I am enjoying my work I hope you are doing the same I appreciate the kind thoughtsTHEM: I returned from a long flight and then woke up super early so my day/time schedule is a bit wonky How are all the animals treating youME: Well They call me the Zen lady at work because of how much more behaved the dogs are when I work 🤷\u200d♀️ Haha Where did you just come back fromTHEM: Zen Lady I like it I’m sure they love you and your naturally cool energy I just got back from LA meeting with some screenwriters and doing some poetry performances It’s good to be back in Portland though Missed the catsME: I like it too Haha Thank you for saying so Screenwriters you say What are you doing thereTHEM: I want to learn more about writing for TV and movies since I want to run my own show someday so I met with someone who currently runs a show — they have some advice I’m still a couple years away at least from anything really becoming feasible but it’s fun to dream Are there any dogs that you can’t help but love more than the others or they’re all kind of just great in their own wayME: You gotta start somewhere and I think dreaming is good Especially if you take steps towards that dream which it sounds like you are so good for you 👍 I thought about it and after getting to know so many dogs I find that I like just about all of them no matter how “annoying” some of their habits may be Lol My only exception is badly trained dogs but I don’t blame them for it and try not to judge them by it It’s really hard to like a dog that tries to bite you or snap at you or bull rush you but it’s not their fault They just weren’t trained So instead I work a little bit more with those dogs to try to understand them and work with them the best I can Dogs know if you don’t like them and they WILL make your life harder if you don’t show them the same respect they give you which is a lot even if they’re not trained So I try to learn about the bad behavior dogs and understand them better and so far it bodes well for me They tend to listen better and understand better and behave better when I show them extra attention which is exactly what badly trained dogs need But boy is it hard sometimes LolThere are a few messages after this that I did not reply to Birthday wishes asking how I’m doing etc I admit to talking to people inappropriately in the past but we discussed the issue and moved forward I thought that these conversations were appropriate but maybe they’re not He also says I loiter people for empathy and don’t tell the truth I’ll admit I confide in my friends and I don’t feel like I’m hiding anything by doing so Or being untruthful But perhaps my actions are inconsistent with my wordsI know I don’t get to decide what hurts my partner and what doesn’t I feel horrible for making him literally hate me I just want to know if what I’m doing is an issue and if I need help I don’t want to hurt people I care about anymore Please help me if you canI really want to discuss this with all of you Please ask questions to gain more clarity and ask about my history in this relationship if you need You can even ask for more conversations with others to get a better feel for what I was doing/how I was acting I’ll give you guys EVERYTHING I want to be open and honest', 617685)

("I am 27 27 F  His second daughter On the day of my birth he left my mother in the hospital alone as she went into labour and went to attend a non essential training related to this job When he collegues in the training came to know he had left mom in labor alone at the hospital with my 15 year old sister they were horrified So he returned During that time had something happened to me or my mom there would have been no one to look after usHe was mostly an absentee father Never came to school for Parent Teacher Meets Used to stay away from home wherever he was posted and whenever he was in town he used to frequently come home drunk to the level of stupor I have seen him be so drunk that he got home and vomited in the kitchen and then pass out on the kitchen floorOne time as i kid i endearingly called him Papu instead of the standard Papa and he scolded 7 year old me that i didn't know how to talk to him and that what the hell was papu Papu was a disrespectful term Whatever love I had for him just died slowly wilted with all that toxicity Who says that to his own childI have habitually seen him misbehave with my mother Call her names in front of us and brutally reject her but calling her a midget cow a dumb idiot and calling her family some names too One time when we went on a family trip with my mother's parents my father tried to insinuate in front of my mothers parents and her other relative that my mother was having an affair with the driver That was the first time I saw my mother crying in front of me I was 11 years old I thought she would leave him after that but she didn't I think for her children's sakeLast year my father told us he was going for a business trip and would be back in 3 days That night mom got a strange text from his number It didn't seem like he had written it And the next morning we didn't get any update from him that he had reached his destination So we tried to call him but all his phones were switched off We called where he was supposed to reach and they said he hadn't  arrived So we all starting panicking fearing the worst We pulled some strings and found out his mobile had last recieved signals from a tower near a forest in our own town and then gone off the radar This made us contact the police While all this was happening I kept calling him relentlessly like a maniac I must have made a 100 calls when eventually someone picked up It was him He was okay But do you know what had happened he had gone with his friends to a forest resort to drink and party and never told us As usual he had had a lot to drink In the morning he had set out to his destination in a stupor in a hired taxi but had become so sick on the way because of the hangover that he had to crash on his party friend's office couch where he slept it off while we were going crazy looking for himIt was a gut wrenching experience but when he came back home he didn't even say sorry Neither to me nor to my mother What an aholeOne day he accidentally shared porn on out family WhatsApp group It was 2016 Unrelated back in say 2007 as a young girl I was using the now defunct social networking site Orkut one day and I just happened to have in one corner of my screen an image of a man wearing only pants and not a shirt It was a display picture of a friend who liked that actor and had chosen to put that picture as his dp But my father saw it and grabbed my hair and pulled it and shook my head very hard and said so that's what you do on the internet Look at naked pictures of guys My mother works  and carries almost the entire financial burden of the family and my father just saves his money or gives it to his mother and siblings who aren't that well off One day he told her and they are 55 and 57 years old he tells her women who work lose their grace They lose that charm that women who are stay at home mothers have It's because working women have to deal with men a lot more After using her financially this ahole piece of sh it says this to my motherHe has a white collar job People see him and gawk in awe that he has had a rags to riches story But he is a terrible human being He misbehaves with all of us He lives in this house like a paying guest I have never had a real father figure in my life When he is nice to me I feel extra horrible because I know that I wanted a dad but his niceness is all a facade He is really just a sh it turd Even today when I am 27 years old and can stand up for myself he still misbehaves with me I give it back to him but I feel awful that he is my father My mother is chronically depressed  and she will never divorce him because it's against her principles They have my brother to take care off who has a learning disability Today my family is completely broken I feel so sad and terrible But all those people who have a nice dad but didn't have resources growing up no amount of money or power or resourcefulness can replace a good father A sh it father can make your whole life sh it Sometimes I feel may be my sexual abuse at the age of 18 was related to not understanding what a healthy relationship with a man looks likeSo count your blessings  and be happy and thank your father for being there for you this father's  day For some of us it's just a formalityTl;dr just an long story about what a bad husband and father can look like to a kid May help you feel better about your family", 616122)
('I’m fairly new to reddit so I apologize if this story should be posted elsewhere but honestly I need to tell *someone* and beings how I’m off today and everyone I know is at work so I’m telling youI know I’m supposed to type something for those that don’t want to read entire thing: basically a woman comes into the store and causes a scene about her husbands drinking who may or may not exist and tried to start a fight with my bossI work at a wellknown “bigsavings” kind of store in the midwest I recently transferred from a small town store to a busier location in the city I live in and located in our business district So it’s a crazy busy store and you never know what kind of people are going to come inSo last night around 9:30pm half hour before close Rosemary walks through the doors I had just finished checking out a few customers and was trying to get everything I had to do done so I wasn’t there an hour after close I’m exhausted and hungry  Rosemary She’s a hot mess of a human man Late 40’s maybe short like me so 5ft and probably 115lbs She has some wild bed hair is wearing tweety bird pajama pants a white tshirt no bra and a black leather jacket So I’m thinking she just woke up and is in a rush for medicine for a sick kid or something right No Nope Never that easy hereShe pauses at my register and is staring at condoms and pregnancy tests I asked “May I help you with something tonight” She turns wild eye and points a finger “You I don’t know you Where is Judiethere she is I’ll talk to you in a minute” Judie is my boss This was said all in one sentence Took roughly 5 seconds and as my exhausted brain tried to comprehend it I found myself nodding to no one as she spedwalked down the seasonal aisle I continued about my business of putting returns back on the shelf but couldn’t help but eavesdrop *because Rosemary* was yelling in the center aisle at poor Judie I paused once as I walked by to witness and exasperated Judie nodding and fake smiling as she tried to comfort a very heated Rosemary “I have been running around all night” Rosemary explained “reminding all the businesses that it is *illegal* to sell alcohol to my husband I have no other option but to contact my lawyer” Judie pats her on the back and says “you do what you need to do” and makes eye contact with me and shrugged so I continued about my business The store got pretty quiet so I assumed Judie was able to work her people magic and calm her down At this point it has been about 15 minutes and I am back at my register checking out another customer That’s when a white car pulls up diagonally and hard shifts into park grinding gears “I’m sure it’s fine” is all I said as I handed an older churchlooking like lady her bags and told her to have a good night That’s when crackhead Betty walks in and says “where is my boyfriend” And storms past me Ok but unfortunately I made eye contact with Rosemary now walking up the seasonal aisle and she is stomping my way holding her leather jacket closed as she shakes her head muttering to herself I tried super hard to cattle her out the door by saying “I hope your night gets better” and started walking towards the candy aisle It didn’t work“If he comes in here and I find out you sold him alcohol you’re going to be getting a call from my lawyer”  She exclaimed“Oh Ok well I don’t know your husband” I say as Judie sweet Judie walks up to the counter beside me and starts counting money for the evening “It’s 5 minutes to close I’m so hungry” Judie says as if Crazy Rosemary isn’t standing there lecturing me“12/23/1947 He lives at random address and he has *motions with her hands as if playing charades* on his head now so he looks different” Bees I guessed bees Turns out it was a hat“He wears that hat to try and throw people off He looks different”“A hat makes him look so different that they don’t know who he is” I say as I turn and look back for help from Judie who is typing away at the computer still acting like things are fine “And don’t think I don’t know that he is fucking someone here I know he is He always has been and she’s still here” Rosemary says her voice is high now and raspy Like Minnie Mouse if she’d smoked for 40 years “I’m so hungry And I feel dirty When you get done with the trash lock that door” Judie nods towards the front doors like *Rosemary isn’t standing here still yapping away* I look towards the doors in Rosemary’s general direction and find that she is holding gun hands at me and yelling “He was in the garage Banging everything around drunk again He’s been drinking all day but he’s banging things and yelling ‘Rosemary is doing this That’s Rosemary’ so all the neighbors can here I’m mad so I get the frying pan and storm out there and what’s he do He leaves And I know he’s coming here” That’s when Crackhead Betty comes running up the seasonal aisle and out the door She gets in her haphazardly parked car backs up and parks it again this time in the handicap space CoolI turn and look back at Judie who looks back at me and smiles “almost done And you got things done early so we might get out of here at a decent time tonight” I look at her perplexed like are we doing this Are we acting like Rosemary isn’t standing here talking crazy talk right now Ok “Yea I tried to get things done” I responded slowly trying to talk over Rosemary “I’d like to be out of her by 10:30 at least” “He thinks he can just go off with other women And not do right by me Me His wife” Rosemary is inches from my face now as I taking trash out of the bins I’m feeling awkward as hell and my anxiety is through the roof I need a cigarette That’s when rosemary decides to say this:“I’m sure Judie doesn’t have to worry about this Do you Judie” Rosemarys voice is strangely threatening “no I’m sure *everything is peaches and cream* at Judie’s house She doesn’t worry about her husband *fucking* everyone do you *Judie*” I pause what I’m doing waiting for a rebuttal from Judie but it doesn’t come It’s quiet and thick in the air as Rosemary sways her head on her chicken neck just begging for a comment This is when Crackhead Betty’s boyfriend comes up to the counter Pissed He slams his wallet down and hands me a card “I need money on here” I ask him how much and he tells me $80 “I’m taking this back to sort it Finish up here and we’re outta here” Judie says excitedly as she walks past Rosemary like she isn’t stinking there and goes back into the office I stand there just miffed at the entire situationBetty’s boyfriend is still counting out money and asks to pay $2 on a card Ok “Like I said if he comes in here Don’t you sell him any alcohol or else I’ll be back” Rosemary says with her gun hands “You owe $8054 “ I tell Betty’s very agitated boyfriend who is now staring at Rosemary “I don’t have 54 cents” he says as he is STILL staring at Rosemary who is now asking *him* if he knows her husband is fucking someone here I tell the boyfriend that I had the 54 and hand him receipt trying to get him out of the store He doesn’t even say thank you and unfortunately for him but not for me Rosemary causally walks out into the night the night with him still talking about her husband and I’m not fucking shitting you when I say the lights turned off Which means it was 10:15 45 min minutes of this nonsense  I had never locked a door so freaking fast This time is insaneRosemary I’m sorry about your luck At this point though I don’t even know if you have a husband But if you do I think I know why he has a drinking problem', 615971)

('It\'s 2014 Early in March on a Tuesday morning And I know your world just shattered You don\'t know it yet but it hasOn that Tuesday morning well before the sun came up your father in the grip of malignant melanoma that over the course of the last year had spread from his liver up through his spine and into his brain; breathed his last breath on this earth At this point in life the whole event seems to blur in one fluid motion But for you Seconds feel like minutes I\'m sure you can remember watching the ambulance crew take your dad down the stairs on that stretcher into the back of that truck and drive off I understand as to why you took that and just bottled it right up As some members of your immediate family friends of your father\'s sit in the living room talking about nothing important at the time you remember something: You need to change the oil in your truck You\'ve been putting off for a few weeks now even though your now late father\'s constant reminders to "get it done" It always perplexed you the man is weeks from dying and all he cared about was preventative maintenance on a truck That man always a car guy seemed to like working on cars and engines more than he liked people sometimes even you It made sense for him but you couldn\'t care any less about that Your dad was dying But now that he\'s gone its all of a sudden is the most important thing in the world to get that done Not because you think it\'s important but because **he** told you toThe Ford dealership just opened up for the morning 20 minutes or so ago You get dressed excuse yourself from the house full of people and go to get your oil changed So far nothing You know the first step in the grieving process is denial  But you haven\'t denied anything Or so you think The man is dead you checked his pulse you saw the ambulance load him up and take him away; it\'s irrefutable he\'s gone You didn\'t deny him being gone but you denied those emotions you kept bottled up with you for over a year Because you had this conversation with your father He told you to "be tough" That this illness was going to kill him He wasn\'t going to win this fight You had that initial shock you cried it out and you eventually came to terms with it In a way you were ready for it What you weren\'t ready for was how the cancer was going to affect is brain when it got there That it would start messing with his memories Make him think he\'s in a different place in a different time Make him forget his 2 sons and his wife For a week he would dip in and out of his realities until the pain began too much and he was put on the morphine drip You weren\'t prepared for that But you stuck it out and bottled that right up tooYou arrive at the Ford Dealership and you step inside It\'s early in the morning on a Tuesday so it\'s no surprise your the first customer in the door You tell the lady at the desk you\'d like an oil change you give her the keys and you go find a corner of the dealership lobby to sit and wait in Now I can\'t recall what did it I don\'t know if all the emotions just caught up with you being around all the cars on the showroom floor He was a Ford guy after all or maybe it was just now that you were alone and you felt comfortable enough to let your guard down But whatever it was it was all it took There it is All that pain and loss and emotion came washing over you like the dam just broke And you begin to cry You not only cry but you sobbed in that empty Ford dealership showroom because your father had just died And you were going to begin to process that whether you wanted to or not No one came and bothered you or asked if something was wrong or if everything was okay And I know you were thankful for that Because regardless of how different you and your father were you were similar in that fact that you hated to appear weak in front of peopleI understand that the rest of that time was such a blur There were more outbursts of tears and rage whether it was with yourself or your brother or your family for one reason or another That you just seemed numb to the whole world around you Even at the funeral you kept it together because that\'s all you could do But unfortunately This would not be the end of your struggles due to your father\'s death You soon learn that your immediate family is only after two things: money and whatever else they could get their hands on Your father wasn\'t a rich man but he did well for himself And what he left was enough for anyone with the same last name as you to fight over it excluding your now widowed stepmother You were the only one to stand up for her In a house that absolutely hated her being there you were the only one to stand by her You and she weren\'t best friends far from it But she stayed with your father to the very bitter end And regardless of whatever her intentions her it was good enough for you And therefore you too became that outcast And was unceremoniously kicked out of your own house and forced to live in your truck for  2 weeks in the upper high school parking lot You were only about a month away from graduating you could handle living in your truck for that long until you left for the military Get out of class drive around for an hour or two until everyone cleared out from the school and just come on back and park for the night Set an early alarm get showered up in the school\'s locker room before class started Easy **That is until Denise found you**She was furious The fact that you had been living in your truck and had not told her To be honest you hadn\'t realized how close she and your father were until he was dying but you knew they were close and always just took it as a matter of fact and didn\'t ask a lot of questions Either way she wasn\'t having this; and took you in that night This woman opened up her home to you Her family to you **Her life to you** At first you didn\'t know what to think of it but as you get older you\'ll begin to realize that this woman saved your life She has singlehandedly made one of the biggest impacts on your adulthood and there is not a drop of blood shared between you two It still blows you away to this day that this woman who has no mandatory duty of care toward you in any way; comforted you sheltered you made sure you were set up for the future above all else ***she*** ***showed you that the world hadn\'t ended yet***Over the course of the next years of your life from this point forward you are unfortunately going to wrestle with the idea that you hope you\'re making your dad proud Your father wasn\'t a vocal person He was brash stubborn and he said some pretty insensitive things to you He was far from the perfect parent There was never any question about that He made his mistakes But the one thing you can\'t mistake is that he loved you and your brother He may not have shown it much but he did He wanted his sons to grow a certain way; to be brought up a certain way and he made sure of that through the only way he knew how to Enforcement He was a hard man But he wanted nothing but the best for his boys That is why I can say with absolute certainty ***that you are making your father proud*** Because you\'re trying Because you give a damn Because you want to make yourself better Through the tears in my eyes I can assure you that\'s how I know you\'re making him proud&amp;#x200B;***Now hear this*** If I can bestow upon you any kind of wisdom to make the following years of your life easier it\'d be this: Let the gravestone go Behind that name is nothing more than an urn full of ash and dust That is not your father Your father is now an idea He lives in your mind and in your heart now Keep him in your back pocket and go find your way Leave the grave in your wake and press on There are going to be hard times to come Points in your life that are going to test you as a man and break you down to the very core of your soul Always push through the pain because that\'s what\'s going to make you grow as a person Embrace change It\'s the law of life Never settle for anything you truly want Ever Make your mark on this world whether big or small just make one; To prove you were here Always hold your head up so you can see the good and the joy in the world Even if it seems there isn\'t any And always follow your heart&amp;#x200B;And Never Quit&amp;#x200B;TLDR: You\'re making your dad proud I promise', 614576)
('A recent discovery about myself has me shook And not in that hipster way that’s like a new song that’s ‘so deep’ and shit Like really shook Confirmation of what I already suspect has always had a dramatically different feeling than expected I am never ever prepared for the truth even though in many cases I’ve already known the truth When I was 15 my mom was cleaning out her closet and I think I may have noticed a box that had something that looked like old baby stuff of mine This was surprising to me as I never really saw anything about my babyhood No really early photos no hospital bands never anything that I gave much thought about My mom allowed me to sift through the box and I eagerly did I came upon fascinating things that I’d never seen of myself before I then found a piece of official looking paper and noticed the Information on the paper was all mine My birthdate my weight my gender etc this paper was about me Then I noticed the paper was titled something to effect of ‘adoption or relinquishing parental rights’ then in one of the lines it read words that haunted me for years ‘baby result of sexual assault’ Not prepared to confront my mom and knowing this was not something I was supposed to see I closed the box and as calmly as I could and ran to my room to call my friend and freak I never asked my mom and never ever grew the balls to bring it up as I wasn’t really worried about it curious but not worried I told a couple close friends to sound exciting and moved on Now well into adulthood I have a pang for culture that has never gone away My parents had always been very vague about our heritage ‘we’re just white’ But I really craved some sort of family tradition and some Information about what made me me At the age of 32 and with the new advances of at home gene mapping I decided to do an Ancestry DNA test Results were in and I quickly found out I’m 25% Italian Wow so exotic The rest was expected white whiter and boring But Italian felt cool My test also gave me information on closely related family members I had one high probability for a first cousin Excitedly I wrote him and he immediately wrote back with enthusiasm and all was well I then started to realize wait we are related on his dads side because his mom is black Then if we are first cousins I believe his uncle would be my father Except that’s not the guy who I call dad Okay inching closer to what I may have discovered years prior I then ask Mark my first cousin ‘do you have an uncle’ Yes he did Holy shit He says his uncles name is Roberto and is he is a ‘nice Italian guy with a heavy accent living down in Florida’ With the world at our fingertips I entered his name and furiously searched I found him There was something strangely familiar Something in the eyes Something  that looked like me This was him it had to be He is my father I thought this would help clear things up but I fact it seemed to have created more questions than answers So I decided to buy a test for my brother and see if we popped up as half We did And in fact my brother was not at all related to my first cousin We had different dads and now there was no denying it Most people would immediately call their mother I couldn’t for some reason I’m not sure why but I felt a lot of anxiety about bringing it up to her She hadn’t told me my whole 32 years she obviously didn’t want me to know Not until some months later while we were having a discussion over current abortion laws did she say something to me that I couldn’t brush off ‘All life is precious even life conceived of rape’ I gaffed  And then thought to myself this is it if there was ever a time it’s now I prepared her for a heavy question and even with the preparation I have never seen my mom caught off guard and shocked like that She was emotional as was I and she ended up letting me know that yes In fact my father was not my biological father and that while my dad was gone on a mission she was violently raped Hearing her talk about this was gut wrenching The realization that I am a product of rape was a heavy heavy blow But in a way I can’t sort out My feelings are so confusing and although I’ve known now for a month or two I’m still really struggling with the reality My mom is the strongest and most successful person I know We are very close The anger and sadness I feel over this is immense The new found amazement and respect I have for my dad who at 22 loved his wife so much he agreed to raise her rape baby is immense My parents have since divorces and he still does not know that I know We have a talktwotimesayear type of relationship strained and awkward to say the least By all respects though he was a decent damn near good father I’m in talks now with a cold case detective from the area and hoping there is a police report to be found and a rape kit that has salvageable evidence I have a very strong feeling that this ‘nice Italian guy’ was a serial rapist His MO was so bold and callous that I can’t imagine this was an isolated incident I want justice for my mom I want this piece of shit to know that I know what he did momentarily overpowered her But he left her with more than he could have ever imaged and that thing he left her with will be his ruin I’m facing a bit of backlash over going after justice 32 years later This man is apparently on his deathbed with an illness my first cousin who has since gone cold on me will not clue me in on My first cousin Mark feels that I should not reach out as it would ‘only serve to terrorize and confuse his wife’ This infuriates me Terrorize and confuse a wife to know the truth of a person she has been married to for 14 years The truth is not my problem I don’t feel and more so how about the terror he selfishly inflicted upon my mother all those years back I will do what I can and go as far as the justice system can take me Which I don’t expect to be very far But should it fail me I plan on taking matters into my own hands and paying Roberto a visit Death bed or not I want him to know I know what he did', 614338)
('I’m not trying to mope but I wanted to talk to someone about this I have a coworker that I hung out with at work for the first time and I don’t know what it is but we instantly clicked Talking to her felt like a breeze time flew by we laughed a ton I don’t know what it is but when we talk it’s like I don’t even have to think about what I’m saying It feels like we’ve been friends forever She stops by when she sees me to ask if I’m okay and tells the manager that it’s time for me to go home when he forgets and I’m too afraid/stressed out to do it myself The next couple shifts together were similar we hung out at work and had a really good time She always gets excited to see me and comes up to me and talks to me and asks me questions about my life and we have a lot of inside jokes together It just feels so completely natural and easy I feel like a fool to say but I think I’m in love with her She feels like the best friend I’ve never had I finally got the courage to ask her out I got my shifts changed and now we don’t work together anymore So I came in on one of her days when I knew it wouldn’t be busy just to say hi When she saw me she said “Everyone’s been calling me [my name] today” because she just bought the same glasses that I wear after she saw me wearing them and liked them We talked for a little bit and finally I asked if she wanted to go somewhere quieter I had never asked anyone out in person not once in my life I’ve never had the courage My heart was pounding She followed me into the break room and I just came out and said it I asked “Do you want to go out with me” She looked totally caught off guard “What”I strategically brought a McFlurry with me so I could shove ice cream in my mouth when I felt awkward So anyway my mouth was full of stroopwaffel McFlurry when I repeated it again Her face went through just about every possible emotion At first there was a huge smile which gave me some hope but then it turned into this face: 😬 and it took her some time to reply and it was taking long enough that I knew the answer would be no My heart sank She said “I have a boyfriend I’m sorry” Her arms were crossed and she looked like she genuinely felt bad for me and I stared at the floor so she wouldn’t see my face I said “It’s alright It’s alright Don’t tell anyone here that I asked you” She said “Okay” and turned to leave I called out to her and raised up my fist She turned around and gave me a fist bump I said “It’s all good” We walked together back to the lobby and I felt like something changed Even though she rejected me I felt like we became closer I wasn’t afraid of her anymore and she didn’t seem afraid of me at all I wasn’t nervous I told her that I liked her new glasses and she asked me about my schedule and my new hours I told her that I wasn’t going to be working at the same time as her anymore and she said “Why” When she asked why she said it in this hushed tone And I said “I don’t know” I started to leave I did actually have somewhere to go and she called out “You’re leaving” and all I could say is “Yeah”This happened yesterday I was pretty sad and just went to sleep when I got home Today I still feel sad but I’m also really proud of myself I don’t know when or if I’ll see her again but I’m just happy I put myself out there Who knows what will happen next but I feel better for it', 614219)
('Sorry for the long post I\'m a seventeen year old female for contextFor awhile now i\'ve been more and more aware of how bad my family treats me and how it has affected my life my family has always been super emotionally distant like we rarely hug my mom never says \'I love you\' unless someone is dying and they tend make fun of my mental health a lotIt never really occurred to me just how much this is fucked up until I had a mental breakdown in september and was sent to the hospital on suicide watch and because of this I lost my job important later Now I was supposed to be transferred to another place for an emergency evaluation but my mom just refused until she could get confirmation that i \'needed\' it which never happened Immediately after I got home my older brother said something along the lines of "oh free vacation Man I should just say i\'m having a breakdown to get out of work" Which made me feel horribleNow whenever anyone in the house is stressed they imply how much of a burden I am on the household for not being able to work so I can help pay for rent and groceries even though I go to highschool full time and am graduating with high marks Even going as far to say I don\'t need my medication which is helping me and saying I should smoke weed instead my mom is incredibly antivaxx and only trusts \'natural stuff\' instead of chemicals from \'big pharma\' I had to fight to get my antidepressants in the first place The funny part is or rather the sad part is that all of them clearly have mental health issues as well but I am the only one who bothered to get help in the first place and they constantly say me going to therapy is a waste of time Even thanks to therapy i\'ve stopped wanting to die 24/7 and have a better outlook on lifeBesides them disregarding my mental health they expect me to toughen up when they say horrible things to me then get upset with me when I get overwhelmed to the point of crying They expect me to make dinner every night but sometimes if they don\'t like what i\'ve made they just get fast food instead of eating whatever I made My older brother is always making fun of my weight and calling me disgusting to the point where it\'s affected me enough to have problems with eatingAnother thing is my mom is very very mentally ill She\'s paranoid aggressive and has complete and utter apathy towards other people and how they feel She in the past week has threaten to burn down the house 3 separate times She goes on rants to me about my biological dad and how he called her stupid for trying to commit suicide and how abusive he was She thinks everyone is against her and gets angry if someone appears upset She on many times has called me an asshole for not eating properly and also told me the government will control me by using my antidepressants to control my mind Really weird stuff that makes no sense She takes pride in her suffering by saying she\'s a \'psychopath\' and used to be extremely aggressive when she was young to the point of hitting and fighting people She constantly wants to mess with my therapist and make him uncomfortable or gets upset when he finds out a new symptom I have Stating it makes her look like a bad mother Sometimes she says how much of a failure she is for letting me live with mental health issues and how its her fault In turn I can never say what\'s wrong with me without her blowing up at me which makes her more angry for not telling her anythingI honestly am at the point where I just really want out of my house and not feel attacked for trying to get better and I would love if they would just stop being so incredibly mean to me I am planning to move out in November but it\'s hard to find a place with a yard for my cats which are the only family who I believe care about me at this point Sorry again for the long post and sorry it\'s a sad one I just really needed to rant to someone I haven\'t bored to death with the issues of my life I really hate blaming people for my problems but it\'s actually true that they make my mental health so much worse Also sorry if it sounds like i\'m whining It just really makes me feel awfulTL;DR: my family has mocked me for years for being suicidal and struggling with mental health even though they all struggle with mental health themselves', 614038)
("I 19M got back home from college a few weeks from college I live in the middle of nowhere and don't have a license if I want to go into town I either have to get a ride or ride my bike for half an hour I'm also pretty introverted and don't really text people that much All this means is that for most of the week I'm alone I play videogames and watch anime occasionally clean do basic chores etc in order to pass the time but I still have a lot of time to think about stuff particularly Her18FI've posted about this before which just makes me feel worse tl;dr: I had a crush on her years ago asked her out she said no because she liked someone else and I mostly got over it we only talk to her on occasion because we're in the school shows but I still had a little part of me would bring the feelings back once or twice I wouldn't act on them because I didn't feel too strongly about it That all changed April of last year again part of why I feel like a psychopath I'm a senior and my sister tells me I should ask Her to prom At that point I knew I'd be going with a friend I'd be off to college come August and there wasn't anyone I felt strongly about and I hadn't really talked to Her who we'll call K that much so I didn't really consider that until my sister said something Something in my head just clicked and it sounded right I couldn't stop thinking about it About K There was something poetic about it and the fact my sister even suggested it through me for a loop Why her Why KI decided to ask someone else a friend who I hadn't talked to in a while but I knew I would have a good time with I write this whole poem filled with memes and videogame references The friend said no but we ended up reconnecting which was nice By then time was running out I was getting desperate and my sister tells me that K would say yes So I ask K nothing creative and she says yes We get in contact with each other and start planning I decided to get know her better and we started talking more The only thing I was afraid of was feelings coming back which eventually of course they did I decided to not address them get through prom and let them just go away I figured it would be best to not bring it up lest things got awkward and that I'll meet someone in college and move on I end up falling out of contact with her the usual I want to talk to you but I don't know what to talk about and everything goes well I still think about her every now and then but otherwise I'm goodThat is until this past April funnily enough I went home to watch the high school show because my sister and a few friends are in it I see K after the show and congratulate her this was also closing night and her last show For some reason she was acting awkward which I thought was unusual for her Now a few weeks earlier my sister texted me if I was still talking to this girl I had met I said no because she wanted to focus on school The random timing of the question through me and I kept asking myself why would she ask that This plus K's behavior made me add two and two to make fish and I couldn't stop thinking about At this point I was attempting to talk to another girl at college and all of this made me confused and I asked a couple friends as to who should I pursue They gave opposite responses so I did nothing but think about my options thank you social anxiety During finals week I decided that I would just give the girl from college my number She ended up texting me and we hung out a couple of times before we left We've texted a few times since then but not in the past week All the while I can't get K out of my head I want to be clear I don't really want to be in a relationship with K I don't even want to have these feelings and I understand that I shouldn't have them given our history or rather lack thereof I know that it's way too late to try to have any sort of relationship with her I just want to tell her so she can turn me down and I can get over it What bothers me more is that this has bothered me for so long and I can't talk to anyone about it because I sound like a psychopath which is probably true I have no one to talk to about this because no one knows except my two friends and all I can do is obsess over it until something happens which makes me feel even worse", 614035)

("So my life right now is a little stressful I'm young so I guess I have lots of things to look forward to but it really feels like my life is really stagnant for two major reasons and honestly I just need to vent a little&amp;#x200B;First reason is family My family for the most part is really good except I do have a younger sister that has been a thorn in my side She is basically the opposite of who I am And it kinda sucks living with her and being around her She would go out on weekends doing drugs and drinking leaves Friday afternoon and comes home Monday afternoon She had lots of bad relationships with one of them where she and him broke up like 34 times they're currently together again Doesn't really listen to our parents and goes behinds their back often to do things like get tattoos she got them under the legal age Losing lots of her aspirations changing career goals etc might be due to her not caring about school like she used to since she consistently tries to get out of classes and her grades has dropped by 23 letters There's a lot more but those are recent things I can think of We've tried to get her help too taking her on vacations giving her appointments to therapy etc While normally I am a type of person who is all about being open minded and try not to judge people for who they are I do make an exception for people who are toxic and hurt others She's a very toxic person and hurts my parents daily It just fucking sucks that I see my parents crying and staying up late at night hoping she replies to a text or comes home I love my parents very much and it just stresses me out so much seeing them like this They're small business owners and immigrated here 2030 years ago and gave us so much Honestly I think my sister is oblivious to how much she's hurting my parents because I would see post stuff saying how much she loves my parents But I'm sitting here thinking that her way of showing love is really weird My parents came to me asking if I can talk to her a little and I've tried but even if she said she would promise to be more mindful the process would repeat Them asking me to try again stresses me out a bit as well because I know my sister will not change anytime soon The only thing that's a light at the end of the tunnel is that she's graduating high school tomorrow and will soon be maybe going to college so I'll be seeing her less&amp;#x200B;Second reason is my career or lack there of So I graduated last year with a computer science degree Got it 3 years so I was hoping to spend that extra year relaxing and begin applying to jobs where fall semester would be Well it's been a year after I graduated and I still have no jobs I got interviews from big companies most people have heard of to small fledgling startups but still no offers It's really taxing not having a job even when I'm trying so hard I have received praises on stuff like my resume but I feel like it's for naught if I don't have a job Computer science is my passion and it feels so bad that I can't get my foot in the door And so many are telling me that it will be smooth sailing as soon as that happens but it's been so hard I've sent 100s of applications and emailed lots of people who said that might be able to help me but still the ghosted messages and rejections pile up My love of computer science has not wain however and I know eventually I will be given a chance but it's really hard right now waking up and thinking that the past year is a waste&amp;#x200B;But I don't want to give everyone things that have been bothering me I want to tell everyone about the positives in my life as well: &amp;#x200B;Even though I don't have a job I've been enjoying going to cafes every other day basically and grinding out coding challenges applying to work and doing personal projects I've done and completed about half a dozen of them and am currently working on one that I've been planning out since I was a freshman in college I've been going to hackathons and it's been great meeting new people and talking to people in the industry I would love to be paid to code but while that happens I've been enjoying growing and coding as a hobby until I get an offer&amp;#x200B;I'm currently trying to lose weight as well I was able to lose 20 pounds in 34 months starting this year but I've been stagnating recently mostly due to being stressed out However I am remotivated to continue losing weight I want to lose a total of 80 pounds by the end of the year this would get me under 200 pounds for the first time since high school and while it looks really rough I want to keep trying&amp;#x200B;I did passport stuff so that's kinda cool&amp;#x200B;My family and friends have been amazing but I want to give such a big shoutout to my parents my girlfriend and the boys My parents have been helping me ever since I moved back from college Hitting up customers and friends who might help me find jobs feeding me and giving me a place to stay and giving me advice in general My girlfriend has been my support for past 3 years we've been dating We talk everyday and encourage each other to push ourselves but also console each other We've been doing long distance since we met in school but she will soon be moving less a couple of cities over for a year to help out students in high schools that are struggling for a volunteer organization And last but not least the boys and gals whether they are day 1 lads or lads I met in college We always shoot the shit and enjoy each other companies We tell each other our struggles and enjoy a nice cold one at the end of the week They've been crucial for keeping my sanity and I can always count on them&amp;#x200B;Yeah life for me has me going through valleys and hills and I just want to share with them I don't really share this unless somebody asks or I truly think they are okay with hearing me vent But just typing this relieved a lot of stress I've been having and it gave me motivation to get along with my day So thanks for reading everyone&amp;#x200B;TL;DR: Sis big oof Career big oof but still am productive Weight big off but working on it People in my life are amazing and helpful&amp;#x200B;Side note since this happened while I was typing this out/planning it in my head: my sis brought in a stray kitten last night It's very young and while it looks healthy it is a kitten She's been out with her boyfriend and I've been at home learning how to take care of it giving it my old clothes feeding it washing it and its temporary box etc I don't know what she will do with it but I feel bad because I know there won't be a lot of people that can give it the attention and care it needs The kitten is basically my sis's responsibility but it's been 1 day and I've probably gave it more care than her Hopefully she will bring it to a nokill shelter or find somebody that can put more time to taking care of it than this household but I'm not holding my breath If push comes to shove I'm gonna reach out to friends or shelters that might be able to take it in if my sis doesn't show initiative and willingness to take care of it&amp;#x200B;And sorry if it appears venty I'm literally getting this off my chest and the words and things I wanted to say is what is popping up in my head", 613201)
('For years I was able to stave off feeling depressed over being single by focusing my attention towards school I was in college for 105 years culminating with a PhD this past December I landed my dream job moved to a great city and scored a deal on a luxury apartment in the middle of downtown And yet I’ve never felt more alone I’ve tried to get more serious into the dating scene and dated a few girls mostly just one date max three since I’ve moved but haven’t come close to feeling a sparkI mostly meet women online and had one message me a few weeks back She was super cute and we immediately started texting almost nonstop Even without meeting this felt different We finally set up a lunch date two weekends ago and I drove down to meet her she lives about 90 minutes away She was even more beautiful in person and it was obvious she was really into me as well Not that long into our date she even mentioned that she was a little nervous because she could tell she really liked me Because of my lack of success dating in the past I usually tend to be very reserved so I’m not used to having those thoughts so early on But the truth was I could tell I really liked her too and told her as much Lunch moved on to coffee which moved on to walking around town which moved on to ice cream which moved on to a late night movie We got real close in the movie and afterwards in the car before I drove her back to her place neither of us wanting to leave each other I can’t count how many times she turned to me that day telling me she really like me and we already had so many future dates planned out This was so much faster than I’m normally comfortable moving but in this case it felt rightThe next day we still texted nonstop making plans for me to drive back down to see her after work that week And then the next morning she texted me saying we shouldn’t see each other anymore I was dumbfounded She had been the one pushing things forward so fast and I had reciprocated against my normal judgement not to fall for someone that fast because this just felt different than with anyone else I’d been with I told her that this had really blindsided me and she said how she did really like me and wanted to be in a relationship but that she had just gotten out of an abusive relationship a few months ago and just couldn’t bring herself to fully commit to someone despite the chemistry we had We talked on the phone that night she was clearly extremely upset and I couldn’t really understand how if she liked me that much why we couldn’t just make things work But I decided to respect her wishes so I didn’t contact her after thatThat was early last week and despite my best efforts to move on I haven’t been able to stop thinking about her Then I feel worse by knowing that every day people break up with significant others they’ve been with for years yet I’m feeling this heartbroken about someone I only met in person onceThen tonight out of the blue she texted me but only to say that we shouldn’t talk to one another anymore I was confused because that was already the way we had left things We exchanged a few messages to reach some closure It turns out she’s going to therapy because of how upset she is that she can’t make a relationship work And here I’m left in a situation where I have someone that I really like who seems to like me back just as much but for reasons I can’t fully understand because I haven’t been through what she’s been through we can’t make a relationship workSo now I’m back to feeling just as low as I was when she first texted saying we shouldn’t see each other And feel worse because I should be so thankful for where I’m at in life right now and I am yet I just can’t bring myself to get over this situationAnyhow for anyone reading this whole mess thanks Just writing this down has helped', 613034)

("2 students in my school committed suicide at my school last year It was only a few days into the new year when our holiday break ended when it happened The first student was a senior who I didn't know of But for some reason it shook me to the core that suicide was in fact very real Of course I understood what suicide was before that But at that point it became more to me than the plot of a teen fiction novel or a sickening meme on the internet It disturbed me that at one point there was a student walking in the same hallways that I still do that was having the same thoughts that I had And they were just a few months shy off of graduating after all the years they had spent in public school When the second student took their own life it was literally a week later A snowball effect Except this time I knew them because I had 2 classes with them I had never had a conversation with them But what I was feeling when I would walk past their empty desk every morning was an intensified version of what I was feeling before  But much worse And let me take a minute to rant here: If I remember correctly our class had planned to have a party type thing where we bring in foods from our cultures and this was planned to be on a Friday It was technically a part of the course but the teacher already said that nobody was getting marked on their contributions When the school broke the news that a student had passed away that was a Wednesday And this student was in our class So why did the fricken party continue on the Friday What exactly was there to celebrate  Why was the school acting normal when it actually was falling apart Its students were falling apart You can't fix that shit by brushing over it like nothing happened I understand that people mourn differently and that maybe we have different perspectives on how to approach a situation But throwing a party 2 days after we learned one of our classmates died You can't have some respect for the person Sitting in that classroom while watching some of my other classmates laugh and talk completely normally was the oddest thing I don't think I've ever felt so alone that day because I understood what those two students did Except I was living  I understood why they did it Not only did suicide become real for me but it also became something I knew I would never want to talk about with someone I knew  I understand that I shouldn't take this personally I understand that this could have affected many other people in the school as well but maybe they decided to hide it I know that I never talked about this with someone so anyone could have assumed the same about me too I know that people say that they don't think that suicide is selfish I don't think it is either Because I don't feel that the feelings those two students had were selfcentered They were just done They were frustrated scared lonely but not alone and tired When it comes to myself though something's different I know a lot of people have it worse than me Which is why I feel embarrassed and selfish when I think the way I do If someone were to talk trash about the 2 students who committed suicide and call them selfish I would bash them But if someone were to tell me the same thing I would probably agree with them And I feel like a hypocrite because I know two people who are close to me and who told me they're suicidal And yet I listen to them tell them it's going to be alright and offer them support when they open up to me But I never talk to them about what I feel And I would never label them as attention seekers But maybe that's what I'm afraid someone is going to call me I think this mainly comes from what I think of when the talk of the “future” comes up Because I’ve never felt that I have a future past high school Everything in my mind past that point is just a big blank I always think that if I were to die by my own terms I would do so before high school ended Kind of like the senior had Because I don’t think I could put the responsibility of a crap ton of student loans on my parents or my brother  But even before I’ve ever had thoughts that are kind of harmful I’ve never seen myself capable to grow as a functioning adult It’s like I’m caught in the bubble of childhood because I’m not sure how I could ever not be so needy or reliant on others I still think that I won’t make it past grade 12 even if it’s not on my own terms There’s just something", 609473)

("For most of my life I have been dealing with severe bipolar disorder and CPTSD + PTSD if the distinction matters from prolonged abuse as well as some oneoff sexual assaults I had kind of gotten my bipolar disorder under control when a little over a year ago I was assaulted again this time by someone I had known for years and considered a trusted friend which was a bit of a last straw  I ended up taking a lot of valium over the next couple months because being fully conscious was too painful A little after that I got out of an abusive relationship which I'm still struggling to come to terms with the abuse not the leaving and a little after that I developed fibromyalgia and have been unsuccessful at finding a way to cope with it And now everything is out of control and I feel like I'm drowning in in all of this fucking garbageMy trauma issues have never been as bad as they are now  I feel like a dam in my head has been broken and my brain has decided I get to deal with this shit all at once I've been having frequent flashbacks and I've been in my own head too much and things have just been very very bad I've been having a lot of suicidal thoughts but am currently safe blahx3Between that and the chronic pain which apart from being something a lot people around me can't relate to tends to keep me at home for weeks at a time I feel completely alone When I'm talking to people especially in groups I feel like the way I'm communicating with them is off or wrong or something and like these people are fundamendaly different from me in some way I feel like a complete different species The people who know approximately what I'm dealing with all seem kinda tired of hearing about it which I get but it still makes me feel pretty alone and also brings up a lot of weird shameI have this wonderful partner who has this amazing ability where when I'm with him he makes me feel like everything is going to be okay The trauma usually isn't a problem when I'm around him and him being there helps stabilize my mood and makes my pain more tolerable This is incredible and something that I feel very lucky to have but it also means he hasn't really seen my bad daysHe knows what's going on he's kind and sympathetic about it and he always asks if he can do anything to help I'm sure this is me screwing myself over but when we talk about this it feels a little like he's underestimating how bad things are and I mean how could he not which makes me feel isolated from him and less able to communicate and to ask for help It feels like I don't have the words to read make him understand what's going on and I'm struggling to get support from himI hate all of this and I want it to go away I know I'm not really alone in any of this but it sure as hell feels like it and I'm at a loss as to how to fix this and reconnect with people", 608392)
('To be clear she didn\'t know it was a PTSD flashback but I\'m not sure that mattersSome context:  four years ago I spent over a year working for a severely abusive and controlling man who eventually sexually assaulted me  He\'s a really important guy and the work colleagues closest to the situation urged me not to tell anyone anything about the situation the other abusive behavior  I never talked about the assault because doing so might hurt my career I left the job and struggled for years with severe anxiety depression panic attacks nightmares mood swings etc I was essentially a shell of myself and could barely function I later found out these were symptoms of undiagnosed PTSD when I sought out a therapist a year agoOkay so a lot of backstory If you\'re still with me here\'s what I need to get off my chestA couple years ago my best friend and I were playing VR games  She started teasing me for not knowing where to sit with the headset on and for some reason it triggered an emotional flashback to how small and helpless I felt after the assault and I just broke down into tears I ran into the bathroom and tried to keep myself from completely losing itAfter I returned my friend told me to sit next to her on the couch and explain what was going on I sat next to her and put my arm around her but I hadn\'t talked about the abuse I experienced under my boss at that point I didn\'t even know where to begin to know how to articulate it so I referenced a nasty fight I had with my uncle earlier that week as an explanationA couple months later my friend and I got into a fight over something unrelated She ended up mocking me for "crying over a stupid fight with \\[my\\] uncle" I was so shocked I didn\'t say anything in the moment but when I went home that night I wrote her an angry email that really offended her We ended up not talking for a yearI sought therapy after reading that Junot Diaz New Yorker piece about his own rape and seeing way too much of myself in it It\'s been rocky and I\'ve had my ups and downs and have seriously considered quitting therapy several times but I have started opening up about what happened A little I don\'t go into detail too much because I\'m afraid of the reactions  people being uncomfortable treating me like a fragile piece of china people thinking I\'m overreacting that it wasn\'t a big deal it wasn\'t *real* assault I brought it on myself etc So yeah I keep it vagueAnyway my friend and I ended up reconnecting when I explained to her the shit I was going through She was also going through some shit with a family member relapsing so in retrospect it was a powder keg of two people illequipped to deal with trauma taking it out on each other I understand thatBut she won\'t take responsibility for behavior I find to be unacceptable I can\'t imagine watching a close friend weep inviting them to sit down and open up to me and then later mocking them for what they told me  regardless of if I found what they were crying over to be "acceptable" or not  Whenever I bring up what she did she always evades it  She excuses herself for not knowing what I was "really" crying about so it was fine she mocked me or she blames it on her brother\'s relapse and says at the time she just wanted me to know that she was going through something worseIt bothers me that she won\'t just apologize She won\'t just acknowledge that you shouldn\'t make fun of someone for crying Am I overreacting Is this something you would let go Sometimes I worry I\'m too sensitive and I should just let bygones be bygones Does this seem like a small thing to be hung up on or should I bring it up with her againThanks for reading', 607438)
('I’ve been in a handful of really bad relationships the past year or two My last relationship ended in me emergency moving out because he was using hard drugs and refused to get help He also had cheated on me but my stupid ass gave him the benefit of the doubt because he came to me crying and told me I was just overall very uncomfortable and needed to get out of thereThe one before that gaslighted me and basically got me shunned from our local hardcore scene telling people I was following him to shows when I’d coincidentally be there at the same time I saw one of my favorite bands out of town and saw him standing side stage we were friends with them and had a massive panic attack and had to sit in the bathroom the rest of the night At another show I was waiting for my other friend to take me home keep in mind I don’t have very good vision and heard his voice from across the parking lot and started panicking He used to tell me he loved me and then suddenly that turned into “we were never together” Meanwhile I have to sit back and watch the band we were in together take off while people who were supposedly my friends watch them talk shit about me and then blame me for being angry The entire friendship and relationship with this person was toxic from the beginning He manipulated me to no end He touched me without permission when we first started “seeing” each other and I dismissed it because I was naive and had never experienced certain things before I was infatuated with him not in love But I told myself it was love and I continued to let him use me until I finally realized what was happening when I found myself manic and starting to self harm again I was brokenThat being said love hasn’t existed for me in a long time I haven’t genuinely loved a person or felt loved since what I thought would be my high school sweetheart fairytale and even that didn’t end up working out because we just grew apart over time But now I’m with someone who makes me feel something again He makes me feel wanted He makes me feel happy He takes care of me He doesn’t think I’m weird for doing or liking certain things He witnessed all of the bullshit that happened with the band breakup and still stuck around even before we started dating because he actually cared to get to know me and know the full story before shunning me or deciding I was someone to keep at arms length Just little things he does for me make me so happy He has a key to my apartment bc he stays with me sometimes to make the commute to work easier and he took my trash out for me and I almost cried He tells me he misses me when we’re apart and means itHe caresHe wants to do things with me Tomorrow we’re leaving on a random trip to go see one of our favorite bands and I couldn’t be more excited He makes time for me and that means the world I don’t have many people to talk to about this because I’m afraid they’ll think I’m crazy due to what happened with band guy so I’m writing this hereI love him I really do I just want him to be happy and successful and I find myself being proud of every little accomplishment he makes and even the ones we make together because we both suffer from anxiety disorders I’m so nervous to say anything to him about how I really feel because I don’t want him to run away I don’t want him to feel uncomfortable I don’t genuinely think he would it’s mostly the anxiety talking but stillI wanna shout it from the rooftops I just felt like I had to get that out I’m not the kind of person to hold that type of stuff in', 606427)
('This original post was in r/xxfitness but the mods removed it which was hurtful but they explained why they did so I can\'t be too upset I received a few encouraging words and some love from the people there and just was I was starting to feel some relief or validation it was removed So I\'m reposting here instead because I guess this is more appropriate Idk I\'m not asking for sympathy just some encouragement or even I guess to try and get it off my mind and have it out there in some form or fashion I wish I could have responded to the comments on the original post before it was taken down but I can say I appreciated them more than I could possibly express Anyway long post ahead TLDR at bottomI can\'t sleep so I\'m awake at 430 am writing this to potentially feel better about a recent negative experience at my gym Background info first but not necessary for the main purpose of the text if you don\'t want to read a ton TLDR at bottom**Background info:** I\'ve worked for the same gym since 2015 at various positions; assistant general manger fitness manager personal trainer occasional weekend front desk attendant I\'ve worked out of several different locations they have in my area as well but my all time favorite gym is the one I\'m currently working at as a personal trainer When I say I love this gym I truly mean it It\'s one of those raw powerlifting body building gyms where even if you\'re not a competitor most of the people in there have been seriously working out for decades I know all the people there and I feel that I\'ve gained a lot of respect working there for several years Further background I\'m a physical therapist and previous olympic lifting competitor People come to me for advice I swap new training styles and tips with my members all the time The environment is very maledominated but it\'s never been a huge issue You get the occasional flirty guy or misogynistic gym bro making inappropriate comments or trying to "teach" me about lifts but you tend to get that anywhere and it\'s mostly new members that do it I\'ve recently started back up on a more serious lifting routine since completing PT school and was making great headway I felt my motivation and confidence building significantly I\'ve never been one to wear middrift shirts or tiny spandex shorts not that there is anything wrong with that to each their own but recently I\'ve been so body confident about my weight loss that I thought why not I started wearing slightly more revealing outfits to show off my definition and because I overheat pretty quickly in general People commented on my progress respectfully and less respectfully but I\'m known to shut people down I usually wear some type of ball cap to the gym that says things like "No" "Boy Bye" etc to indicate that I\'m not interested in advances of any sort and this was preboyfriend The gym has always been my safe haven to work out my anger and anxiety issues I also feel like I\'ve established a real gym "family" that encourage me and that I joke around with all the time**Main reason for recent gym aversion:** So roughly 3 weeks ago a young man had to be between 1823 was arrested in the gym and carried out by several officers during prime time Apparently he had been taking pictures of women in the locker room our locker rooms are just refurbished changing booths from a previous clothing store with no ceiling type covering but very high walls and benches while they were undressing Last I heard 5 women were pressing charges against him and he was of course permanently banned from the gym I felt horrible for them because I love seeing more women working out in the male heavy gym Most of the guys there were complaining that it was going to become *more* of a sausage fest than it already is yeah super concerning guys I got a call on Monday from my general manager and personal friend that I\'ve worked with since 2014 started out at a Gold\'s Gym with him because he had been trying to reach me but I was traveling internationally I could tell in his voice that something was very wrong He informed me that they saw the guy follow me into the locker rooms and an investigator was going to be calling me to discuss pressing charges against him My whole world was SHOOK I\'m still processing this information I haven\'t received a call yet to confirm is the guy was distributing the pictures anywhere but apparently I was nude in them Needless to say I\'ve been experiencing a wide range of emotions since then but we don\'t have to get into all that because this post is already super long I\'ve been having what seem to be like minipanic attacks heart racing gut wrenching feeling difficulty breathing chest pain occasionally especially when I think about going back to the gym this week My confidence is shattered I know I shouldn\'t feel this way but I blame myself somewhat for wearing such "revealing" outfits and that I could have somehow prevented it My mind is of course racing with thoughts especially worried that my nude pictures are floating around somewhere on the internetI go back to the gym today I took 2 days off and I\'m worried The gym is of course a very gossipy place and I don\'t know who all knows about it memberwise My GM told me that the CEO who works out of my gym some corporate people and the assistant GM who I personally dislike and has a HUGE mouth are the only employees who know After hearing my GMs voice as he told me the news I could hear the pity coming from it I don\'t think I can look them in the eye or have them stare at me knowing this information I\'m very paranoid that people at the gym will know and will be looking at me now Instead of the cute outfits I\'ve been wearing I just want to wear baggy sweats and oversized Tshirts but I know if I suddenly change the way I dress people will absolutely notice and potentially question in I basically want to be invisible in my gym or never go back but I need the income and it breaks my heart to think of not going thereSo I\'m still processing the event but obviously the anxiety is preventing me from sleeping I know that it could have been worse heaven forbid so I don\'t understand why this is affecting me so significantly Especially after coming from a lot of abuse that was far worse in my lifeI\'m looking for advice or just general discussion about inappropriate sexuallydriven experiences that you\'ve faced in the gym I\'m not sure how to deal with this and I\'d like to hear from others who can understand what I\'m going through**TLDR:** I\'m panicking about going back to the gym I\'ve loved and worked at for years because some pervert took nude photos of me in the locker room and possibly distributed them to others', 606313)
("Throwaway here as some shrewd people may put 2+2 together I know this will get buried somewheres and that's okay I just need to get it out there and out of my corroded soul    This is going to sound pretty entitled and whingey but here goes    I'm in my mid twenties mentally ill divorced broke burnt out and pretty done with life My father killed himself in front of me when I was 1X suffering from the same mental illness that I have now It was during Christmas and I was spending the holidays with him instead of my elderly adopted family He asked me if I loved him and I didn't say anything back as I was upset at him for recently relapsing He walked into the living room and shot himself in the face with a shotgun This kind of set the tone for the following 10 years    Before all this I had gotten expelled from my school after badly beating up a kid who stole my YuGiOh cards and my foster parents moved to a very remote town I was put into a different highschool and I decided that I'd be damned if I ended up like my father with no education and in a deadend job     I poured myself into school graduating high school when I was 16 years old skipping in the process with an insanely high average 95+% I was kind of lost and seriously contemplating suicide for the first time One of many many times to come over the years    I used the money that I got from pawning my father's stuff to pay for a year of college I didn't fit in at all I was super socially awkward and I was the loneliest I'd ever been in my life I failed out of college and was in a very stuck place I was far too proud to go home and admit that I wasn't good enough Queue first suicide attempt    I did what many lost 18 year old's do and joined the military Oof Social problems hit an all time high For those who are curious it is an absolute bloodbath if you can't integrate well into the ranks ie: have basic social skills I had a real rough time I was the dude who was always fucking forgetting things and causing problems for my platoon The staff were on my case the whole time and I had zero self confidence or self esteem Anxiety was pinging off of the rev limiter It's awful to say but I wanted to complete at least a year of service before killing myself so I'd get a military funeral The epitome of cowardice and abuse of public funds I know and I'm ashamed of myselfI met a girl from a nearby town Lets call her Jenny Jenny was from a very emotionally abusive family and also had her fair share of problems We fell deeply in love as young something year old's do and decided that we'd get married So we did Totally shotgun style too as we were both pretty broke Her from not really holding down a place to live or job for very long coupled with a mild marijuana addiction yes it's a thing and me from a blossoming drinking problem very much a thing We moved around quite a lot and bless her soul she followed me even when we were renting single rooms out of peoples houses in the ghetto    Fast forward a few months of trying to find her a job in the city my emotional unavailability and her increasing frustration with the area we were living and bam I come home from work after my sarge let me out early to her getting railed on the used sofa I bought online for $40 Yeahhhhhh    She moved back to her town and I stayed in mine As a private pay was not super high Alimony was as I volunteered to give her a very generous amount of money My electricity/heat was cut off after a couple months and I had to study using candles Weirdly enough these became kind of fond memories I would go to kitchen garbage very late at night to scrounge for some food because I'd be damned if I'd ask for help I even maintained a positive image with my peers by doing afternoon barbecues in the summer Nobody would ask why there were no lights on as I'd just say that I'm saving electricity Turns out that sometimes people leave a lot of propane in their expired canisters /r/brokelifeprotipsSo there I was broke as fuck no longer an alcoholic with exactly $400 to my name So I made a huge financial mistake Seriously don't do this I got ridiculously lucky I poured it all into bitcoin and started to trade it I went to the recycle depot got a laptop for $20 and went to the coffee shop WiFi Turns out I'm pretty good at trading I switched to high leverage trading I paid off the loansharks all the alimony money up front swallowed my own god damn pride and moved into a buddy's place to save money Bitcoin exploded and I sold all my bitcoin when it hit $17k I paid off my last debt/payday loan and closed my account I went into debt again to buy a $4000 beater from a ridiculously high interest rate centre because I can't get approved anywhere else     Things plateau for a year I met and broke up with another girl as she convinced herself I was cheating on her Nope I'm just kind of emotionally dead The only real feeling I had was hope that I wouldn't wake the following morning At this point it was just mildly comforting     I got a cat He's the most adorable bellyrub loving floof you'll ever meet He's also the sole reason I wake up in the morning anymore    Then shit hits the fan again The ex wants my pension Lawyers now Travelling Back into the red Fuck I scrimp and save enough to pay for it all over again There's been a lot of beans eggs and potatoes over the last few months I survive like I always do Nowadays my adopted parents are now in their late 70's and I'm desperately saving money to go home to see them more often It costs astronomical amounts to travel in my country Not happening now    This month my car catastrophically fails I had to get it towed and fixed Emergency fund: annihilated Yesterday I look into my adorable floof's eyes and find that one of them is pink I immediately withdrew the last couple hundred dollars to my name to make sure that some weird automatic payment doesn't take it At least I have vet money now Bank accounts: $0  I threw in my last frozen pizza last night to cook Whilst I was staring at my ceiling from my bed in despair and overwhelmness my nose informed me that I had neglected to remove the plastic covering on it It was now ablaze in my oven with the most revolting smell I think I'd ever experienced    Seriously will this ever get better This all took place in a little over ten years and I have at least 5 more of these to live through Sweet baby Jesus my seatbelt can't get any tighter for this ride", 605963)

("TL;DR : ~21M USA I worry about everything have severe depression am scared of being poor my entire life because I'm not intelligent enough and scared of the future plans marriage kids etc because of climate change and the world changing I feel hopeless sometimes suicidal and would like advice I'm 20 years old turning 21 in September I was raised and still live poor I have been stressed day in and day out with very few breaks since middle school From worrying about war climate change how to achieve my goals my relationship to my health and all the things that a lot of people worry aboutI was diagnosed with severe depression towards the end of March this year I spent most of my spring semester in my dorm only leaving to eat or go back home I never went to class This bothered me but I had been contemplating suicide for some time so it didn't bother me enough for me to changeI was forced into therapy by my RA when a friend of mine mentioned that I had rarely shown up for class The RA came to my dorm and woke me by banging on my door I had been sleeping for a maximum of five hours per day sometimes staying awake for over 24 hours at a timeTherapy was nice but besides feeling like I was in good hands the therapy did nothing except provide temporary relief I had a one hour session every week and I would walk out of the sessions feeling better It didn't take long for that feeling to wear off Therapy was nice but it only confirmed that I was depressed and not making it up in my head while trying to deny itI received a medical leave from the university and I moved back homeI have not had therapy since mid April and I haven't been able to deal with my symptoms on my own I have gained almost 50lbs and eat compulsively because it makes me happy for a whileI have come to terms with myself and realize that I have a bad relationship with foodI enjoy spending time with my small group of friends but like food or therapy the boost in happiness is temporary and being there for too long diminishes the effects Once I leave my friends I am usually unhappy or feeling low before I leave their neighborhoodThrough all of this I have always had a passion for creating music In fact it is what I was studying at my university But I have not written much and I have not felt the same fire in my chest as I did before college I do not feel any drive I have spent almost half of my life writing music learning instruments exploring and experiencing music but I have basically nothing to show for it I have never had a job despite applying to a couple dozen positions I qualify or almost qualify for around my town and two other neighboring cities I must be doing something wrongI feel like despite being alive for this long I have done nothing with my life that I am proud of or is worth whileWhat advice would you give somebody who feels lost and hopeless I feel like the rest of my life will either be the same or slightly better because I lack the skills or competence to go into a field of work that pays more than tips or minimum wage and I don't see the point in living if that's the case I will not raise a family on minimum wage and I don't know if I even want kids anymore because of how the world is changing I can't even say for sure that I want to marry anybody in the futureI have a girlfriend we've been together for almost three years but she has her own problems and mental health issues Neither of us have been in a relationship for this long and both of us have been determined to stick together for as long as possible She's my best friend and who I thought I might marry and have a family with but I can't say for certain I want to do either of those anymoreAdvice please Links resources wisdom anything I need help", 604985)
('A bit of backgroundI am 22 living in a foreign country and I met this amazing girl 8 months ago she is 20 and also a foreigner here we got off really good since day one and everything was perfect; the talks the jokes spending time with each other and of course the sex Our relationship started out of a really bad thing; at the moment when I met her she was in another relationship but seem rather unhappy most of the time adding to that an unnatural attraction that we felt for each other well you can surely see what happened We started having sex and then dating while she was still in this other relationship after about 2 months she decides to end her previous relationship and go for something serious with me thing to which I completely agreed; by that moment I had already fallen crazily in love for her A short time after I had to move to another city to continue my studies and since she was not studying nor working I asked her to come with me; she agreed and off we go to live together   Something really important is that we had a crazy amount of sex before and after moving in together we got to really know each other in this aspect sometimes we would be all for it sometimes she or I would play hard to get but it was always fun and games until it wasn\'t any more One night out we were drinking per usual and during the whole night we were exchanging looks and thoughts and we both knew that once we got home we would have sex When we got home we were both drunk and started fooling around; kissing and touching each other all consensual up until that point Before we went any further I told her I needed to pee so I left I returned and tried to keep things going but she had changed her mind for some reason while I was in the bathroom and didn\'t feel like having sex any more I kept pushing  because I thought that she was just playing hard to get pushing and pushing until I touched her there and she had to pull my hand away In the month to follow I noticed how she lost trust in me she didn\'t want to see me or talk to me any more and finally how she distanced herself from me for a good reason I have been struggling with this situation as well for the past month and I know that nothing I ever do will take back what I already did that is impossible Around two weeks ago we were talking about how awful the last month has been and how we felt at that point she told me explicitly that she wanted to break up because she didn\'t feel the same way about me any more she doesn\'t feel safe with me and it honest to god broke my heart; I asked her for a second chance to try and rebuild what I tore down and she accepted she didn\'t look angry any more but without hope  Just last week we finally spoke about how we truly felt because since we are living together the past month had been basically just pretending to be in a relationship and has hurt like hell for both of us We laid out everything about how we think and feel and found out that we are both in a serious self conflictOn her part she says that she still loves me and cares for me but that the thought of what I did keeps coming to mind  and prevents her from getting close and sometimes even makes her want to get away from me She says that she is almost 100% sure she doesn\'t want a relationship any more and that she wants to stay friends but at the same time says that she doesn\'t want to stop spending time together sometimes holding hands hugging or cuddling As a final note she told me that she just realized she doesn\'t feel physically attracted to me any more and that she doesn\'t know if she will ever be again and that maybe that is why she doesn\'t want to be with me in a relationshipOn my part since the incident I have been feeling like a monster like if I was somebody else inside my body It took me some time to really let the thought of what I actually did sink in nonetheless it didn\'t alleviate the guilt or the pain that I\'ve been feeling for hurting the person I care about the most in such a despicable way I can\'t sleep well I can\'t eat and I feel really impotent that I had the "power" to ruin everything but I don\'t have enough to repair it I truly feel horrible about what I did to her and I do not want to force her into doing something she doesn\'t want to again However I also don\'t want to give up on our relationship because of several reasons most important of all I still love her On the other hand I know that I have to agree to what she decides if it is trying again or being friends but I don\'t think I am capable of the inbetween that she is asking of sometimes holding hands hugging or cuddle while watching a movie or show mostly because it hurts like hell that I know we would only be friends but still do all those intimate things together I really do not know what I must do I want to keep trying to fix our relationship and show her that if I had the power to decide to hurt her I also have the power to decide not to do it again and be better; but I don\'t want to force her into trying again seeing that this is the main reason that we are where we are nowWe still are living together at least for a couple of months and moving out is not an option in our situation', 603792)

('TLDR; I moved interstate to be with a guy I met online together 5+ years kind of emotionally abusive I cheated we broke up I moved back to my home state I’m with someone else and now I miss him A lot  *yes I know I’m the worlds biggest asshole for cheating I would never have thought I’d be a cheater*When I was 17 I started speaking to a guy on Facebook who lived in Perth Australia I was living in Melbourne We eventually became so close speaking on the phone every night sending each other letters we told each other we loved one another then a few months later I flew to Perth to meet him and stay with him for a week It was the best week of my life From then I flew over there a few more times before deciding on my 18th birthday that I was flying to Perth to begin a new life there I moved there leaving all of my family and friends behind in Melbourne Things started off great and then I noticed he didn’t like me doing anything I wasn’t allowed to go out make friends even hang out with his sister and her friends He wouldn’t have sex with me often maybe once a fortnight if that 4 years passed by I was still with him I loved him but not as much as I once did I still hadn’t made any friends and I was starting to become very isolated and nervous around people I’d spoken to him multiple times about my feelings and mental health and I wasn’t coping coming from such a big family to having no one at all He didn’t understand I enrolled in a course where I made a friend finally I would hang out with her and go to her place and her boyfriends friend used to be there all the time so we would all hang out I started catching feelings for this guy It took a while but he would give me attention where my boyfriend wouldn’t He would listen to me my boyfriend wouldn’t My boyfriend and I were fighting quite a lot because I was spending so much time at my friends house we had a huge fight and I told him I needed space and I ended up staying at my friends house The other guy was staying over as well  I slept with him I felt awful but also a sense of relief Then I became confused I didn’t know how I felt about anyone One of my boyfriends friends picked me up from my friends house as he was in the area we drove and on the way to my place we stopped in at his place to have a smoke Whilst having a smoke my boyfriends friend tried to come onto me in which I replied and asked him to take me home as I was uncomfortable He did try and push and push but nothing happened He dropped me home and I came clean to my boyfriend about it all I broke him and I broke his heart I never thought I’d be the person to cheat on anyone I still can’t believe it to this day I feel like the worlds biggest arsehole When I told him about what I had done he cried and ended up going to his friends house We tried to work thru it but it wasn’t working and in all honesty I wanted to be with him still I moved out to another friends place We had officially broken up once I moved out but we both found it hard to not message each other because we had been together for 5 years We seen each other a few times here and there and then we ended up sleeping together a few times as well but we were living separate lives I went overseas and whilst overseas he was still messaging me and it slowly got less and less by the time I got back home I decided I’d be moving back to Melbourne I didn’t see him before I left I haven’t seen him in 3 years We had a dog together and we basically had our life setup house furniture etc We eventually stopped messaging each other one day it took nearly a year to get over him completely I would cry myself to sleep every night hysterically then one day I just didn’t Since then I’ve got a new partner who I’ve been with for just over a year who I love and he knows everything about me and we’re great together but he isn’t my ex and lately I’ve found myself thinking about him a lot more and I miss him I don’t know what I’m looking for here but I just want these feelings to pass', 603220)
('Sorry if this is a wall of text but I have to lay my thoughts out&amp;#x200B;I was in a months long relationship that recently ended and upon reflection I\'m not sure if I was in a serious relationship or if it was a healthy one&amp;#x200B;I\'m a 21 year old guy and in university Before this girl I had not been in a relationship and before going to university I didn\'t have any female friends This girl and I were friends for two years before we dated and she was the first girl I truly liked  When I first met her she said she was bi with a preference for women and she expressed interest in a friend or two of mine who were not really like me physically or personality wise so I didn\'t ask her out or try to engage with her romantically I would still hang out with her over time and we became close however I would be the one contacting her to hang out for the most part  After two years of being friends she asked me out to my surprise and I said yes She left most of the date planning to me Things went great and we stated dating Due to  circumstances we decided to end the relationship We are still on good terms and she\'s called our break up a "break" and she\'s said she\'d like to get back together when we\'re back in the same place she\'s moving away temporarily&amp;#x200B;With this break I\'m not sure I\'d like this to happen anymore I\'ve been thinking and listening to that voice in the back of my head which I ignored during the relationship She\'s a busy person I get that but so was I I thought about her a lot during the day and would once in a while shoot her a text or send her a meme or something like that I thought it would be nice if she did the same but she never did When we would go out I would be the one to ask her to go do something she rarely texted me I get the feeling that If I wouldn\'t have texted her we wouldn\'t have had any contact for days or weeks I don\'t know I feel like I was never really that important to her and I feel a bit neglected now that I think about it I don\'t think I was clingy Whenever I\'d text her she would take hours to respond some times the next day and I\'d never send another message asking for a response I brought this up with her and she said she was bad at texting and that she\'d try more but it never got better  Whenever I\'d call her and she didn\'t pick up she didn\'t pick up often she never give me a call back I ignored this during the relation ship thinking that\'s just her but looking back I would have liked it if she put in a bit more effort I got her a really awesome and thoughtful birthday present which she also said was great and one of the best gifts she\'d ever received When it was my birthday she gave me a simple gift but told me that she had a great and thoughtful one she told me what the gift was and it sounded awesome and truly thoughtful at her parents house that she had to pick up She wen\'t to her parents house multiple times and never brought back said gift and I never brought it up&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;She wasn\'t very physical either She\'d hold my hand and I\'d hold hers The initiating there was pretty even but didn\'t happen a lot mainly because I had this feeling that if she didn\'t try to hold my hand she didn\'t want me to try and hold hers Almost every single time we kissed I initiated it I\'d giver a kiss on the cheek or something like that every once in a while or a peck here or there She\'d only  I guess "enthusiastically" kiss me when I\'d leave for the night or when we stopped hanging out for the day The few times she gave me a kiss out of nowhere or held my hand I felt like I was on top of the world She initiated making out with me once or twice but that was at parties when she was drunk I wasn\'t drunk because I was DD she didn\'t like driving and she was honestly bad at it so I wouldn\'t really reciprocate then because it didn\'t feel right She said she had body image issues so for the entire relationship we never had sex nor were we ever naked in front of each other  I never pushed her on that I just told her that I thought she was great and beautiful which she is and that I\'d be willing and excited when she was ready It didn\'t really feel intimate physically and that is something I started really wanting because I found her so incredibly attractive and I connected with her very well emotionally What was irritating is that she would be more touchy with friends but not a lot with me&amp;#x200B; I would say we had emotional intimacy when we were together I was with her during some very dark times for her Our conversations were good and I made her laugh a lot and I had a lot of fun with her I don\'t know how to explain it but I just liked being around her doing whatever I never minded helping her do tasks here or there or driving her places in fact I offered I just wanted to be around her It was like I was under some sort of spell I could watch grass grow and still feel happy and satisfied if she was with me We had funny inside jokes I really loved  and still do her and she said she loved me &amp;#x200B;I don\'t know if that was true though Sometimes I get the feeling she wasn\'t satisfied being alone with just me She was very forgetful and would sometimes make plans with other people when she had previous plans with me She would sometimes invite other people to come hang out with us when I thought it would just be the two of us Like sometimes we\'d make dinner plans and on our way to the restaurant she\'s say "oh I told X he/she could come with us" and then when the person got there she wouldn\'t really pay attention to me I looked past this because being with her just felt great &amp;#x200B;I\'ve been trying hard to forget about her but sometimes I hear a song or see a product at the supermarket she liked or see people that look like her and I\'m reminded of her I\'ve texted her a couple of times to catch up because we\'re on good terms and friendly but again she hasn\'t texted me I was conscious of most of this during the relationship but like I said I just ignored it or thought of it as not a big deal I don\'t know If I would want to get back together with her Idk if this is the right place to post this but I had to get it out', 601656)
("I'm new to this subreddit and finally have a place to talk about this and I'm scared and sad but also relievedAbout two years ago I met a friend of mine online and we grew extremely close like to the point where we were talking daily and for most of the day I'm someone who grows really close with people in my life and if you're my friend or family then you're one of the most important parts of my life Me and this person talked about life love sexuality we both were trying to get a grip on ours fears weaknesses you name it I was the first person she opened up about her anxieties with someone she really trusted and that meant a lot to meFast forward to about January 2018 and she meets this group of friends and things take a turn for the worse They are all extremely forward within the first day of meeting her and meeting me a few days later They are telling me they love me they don't know me and all these things that set off so many alarms in my head She didn't see anything wrong and continued a friendship which in turn caused our own friendship to turn and go down a slippery slope of us fighting all the time She would make pathetic excuses for not responding to my text messages for hours but would be on the phone with them all day long It just were lies that were accumulating and they were doing more things that gave me red flags ex: blocking me even though I never talked to them and never said anything bad to her about them directly She ran back to me after something terrible happen and I was there for her but it lasted about a week before they wanted her back after being absolutely terrible and vile towards her and I told her it was a bad idea She didn't listen and I decided to end our friendship A few months later she messaged me and apologized and said she was starting to see what was wrong they were using their mental illnesses as a way to keep blowing up and apologizing to her I helped her out of the friendship despite all of their attacks on her and calling her horrible namesWe decided to rebuild our friendship for a few months and things were great until she became friends with one of the people from the friend group again It might have been my own fear or just the fact that she started to change again but our friendship was once again doomed I decided in May 2019 to end our friendship for good because I couldn't do it anymore She was still making up lies and still not putting in effort for me but for this other person I couldn't do it anymore and I had found new friends who were treating me so much better and making me so much happierI unfollowed her on all social media finally and have started to refind my love for things that were ruined for me because of our friendship ex: writing different music discord which was our main messaging platform And I have online friends now who really and truly care about me and give me such a learning curve because of how I see friendships and relationships after being let down and strung along for so longBut I want to get off my chest that it's taken me a long time to not want to go and visit her profiles or text her or reach out and see how she's doing It's taken me two years to put myself first and to stop being upset when I think about the friendship we could have had I'm finally not sad thinking about the past but happy to move on and think about how I can happily cope and learn", 601344)
('Ex 28f and I28m broke up a couple months ago She has a drinking problem and I couldn\'t deal with it anymore I recognize relapses happen but she would always get just So angry so mean and terrifying I was so afraid I\'d come home one day and she\'d have killed herself And after finding a mini bottle of wine before class I knew she was back at it and it had been the final strawWe still live together  neither could afford the lease on our own but we\'re doing what we can to be cordial I very very often think about her and what we had We both still care very deeply for each other and she feels terribly about losing me and everything that\'s happened But I\'ve recently been diagnosed with RA and my mental state is starting to deteriorate Simply frustrated and angry all the time from being in constant agony Meds don\'t seem to be working and the VA is well The VA I don\'t have it in me to deal with my shit half the time let alone what she\'s going through at any particular moment And I don\'t think that\'s fair to either of us regardless of how we may feel This is the true reason we can\'t be together The alcoholism I want to help her with But I can\'t even deal with me and I just feel myself getting worseAfter a couple weeks she brought it up and I agreed to not get onto any dating while we were living together out of respect for each other We both still care about each other and dating while living together would be not fun for anyone About a month later I had a friend contact me about finding her profile on Tinder I wasn\'t mad that she was looking but being lied to again hurt like a mother fucker Like Why She said it wasn\'t active and it was likely because she simply didn\'t deactivate the account after we agreed no dating and apologized However I also found out she had created an account on seeking arrangements Sitting next to her on the couch I saw her do a quick change from the site to Reddit Again not mad she did it just that she fucking lied to me made me so angry and hurt She was acting very suspiciously and guarding her phone far more than normal So when she went to show me something her mom had sent I saw she had been texting "Greg"  someone I\'ve never heard of and we\'ve been together for a couple years now Obviously I couldn\'t see the entire message but I understood they had met and they were supposed to go on another date later that night after I left to meet up with my friends I called her out on her hypocrisy and she got mad hurt and very apologetic I told her if she wanted to date people that\'s fine She\'s an adult and I\'m not able to stop her and that her business isn\'t my business She still wants to be with me and makes it clear every day It is so fucking hard telling her no  But she said she didn\'t want to date or talk to anyone  simply she was lonely and would stop since we agreed previouslyWe\'ve had sex since then Terrible idea but extremely sexually compatible and we\'re both frustrated Not a legit justification but it happened Since we\'ve been looking for our own places as the lease comes to an end she\'s become more guarded again: she asked me what time it was and with her phone being most readily available I looked to see the clock I hit the button to light the screen and read the time to her She noticed she had a text and immediately snatched it out of my hands so I might not see it  The text was from me about something I had found regarding a car She\'s been spending So much more time on normal shit than necessary Smoke breaks are constant "scrolling Reddit" when I can fucking see her fingers doing texting actions and her behavior is completely off I feel paranoid as fuck but I know this person I\'ve spent almost 3 years around her This isn\'t normal of her I\'ve seen messages pop up that I\'m sure would be dismissed as "I\'m apartment hunting"  But I know they\'re not I\'m not stupid I know she\'s talking to guys again I\'m certain she\'s still talking with Greg And I\'m sure whoever else is super cool  I want her to be happy I\'m just so fucking devastatingly hurt that she continues to lie about shit I don\'t know why it matters It doesn\'t I just care about this person so much and I know we\'re not together but I still feel betrayed I trusted her and it just I feel broken and far more aloneI\'m going to be sick', 600843)

("My first attempt at writing this ended up being a novel so I'm going to try to keep this briefI don't fall for many people and when I think about dating I have to meet a person I like first before I even have the desire to date Which essentially means that up until less than a year ago I was an unfeeling robot who swore she would never date because it was a distraction The first guy I seriously wanted to date broke me out of that way of thinking and I began to think maybe feelings weren't so bad But then he started a relationship with someone else before I could reveal my feelings to him I liked him for years I don't think he ever knew and I hope he never does I met a second guy on a dating app and he surprised me by capturing my attention and having many of the same interests as me We chatted for a while and ended up having a first date but it's been complete and utter silence from him ever since and it's driving me up a wall I know he's got a busy life particularly right now and I should be patient and wait it out but the anxiety just won't shut up The lack of contact for over a week is bothering me and then the fact that it *does* bother me bothers me It's a vicious negative loop that I have trouble getting out of I can barely tell the difference between the anxiety and my real thoughts especially when my anxiety spikes I feel guilty whenever I check the dating app I'm only ever interested in one person at a time and the second guy is it right now so I feel nothing for anyone else I've been talking to Some of them are under the impression that I'd like to go on a date with them Every time I reply to one of their messages I feel guilty And I'm well aware that I'm a hypocrite for ignoring their conversations when I don't have the energy or drive to answer but then obsessing over the silence that I'm at the receiving end of I'm trying to hold onto hope and wait things out But if this ends like thiswith no answer with me not knowing why I wasn't enough or what I did or didn't dothen I think I give up on dating At least for a while I know that I'm young and everything is new and early and there's still plenty of chances but my mind has been running itself in circles even more than usual in the silence Life would be a lot easier right now if I had just held myself to my promise not to give in to my feelings", 600355)
('We used to be best friends spending so much time together just laughing opening up to each other when finally we committed ourselves to each other I still remember the day you told me you had feelings for me honestly it was the happiest day of my life You could tell by the fact I just couldn’t stop smiling How did it go so wrong once we were in a relationship You were emotionally abusive towards me You said that you weren’t but you were I couldn’t ask to see friends without you going in a mood with me and making me feel bad about it accusing me of going to cheat on you When I found out I was going on an exciting trip abroad for a week for work you could see the excitement in my eyes yet you go in a mood with me and tell me not to cheat on you and you don’t bring it up once after that Even my family you’d always have to cause some sort of argument and then you’d bail on seeing them leaving me to make excuses for why you couldn’t make it yet again All of this yet I never ever had a problem with you seeing your guy mates even going on a trip with one of them just you two because I trusted you You’re best friend always hated me I don’t know why She met me once literally once and we actually got on but you used to tell me how she would tell you to leave me and the names she would call me It makes me wonder during the whole time we knew each other what did you actually tell her about me What were you saying that was painting this awful picture of me You used to lash out at me go in moods with me over nothing make me feel like I wasn’t good enough for you constantly telling me I didn’t love you or care about you when I did literally nothing but everything I could do for you I used to shrug it off when you’d tell me it was “just your head” but looking back I think you would just use it as an excuse to treat me badly and then try and hug and kiss me later as if everything was ok If I got upset by the way I was feeling based on how you treated me somehow I was the bad guy some how it was turned around onto me As if me being hurt and upset by the way you would treat me was out of order and I should just accept that you’re going to give me a hard time and that’s just the way it is If I complained about how much we argued I was being “over dramatic” and “every couple argues multiple times a week” No no they don’t Not couples in healthy relationships not couples where one of the partners wouldn’t cause fights with literally no grounds You used to make me feel bad about us not going on holiday despite the fact I had just bought my first apartment an apartment you practically lived in for over a year without paying any rent whatsoever I had to buy a car which was then stolen a few months later then I had to pay to have it recovered Despite knowing all of this you would still have a go at me for not taking you on holiday when you knew exactly how much I was struggling financially and the fact I was in overdraft at the end of every single month with no savings Then one day you pushed me too far I snapped I ended it between us because I was so hurt by you and the things you said to me Then when you came to collect the last of your stuff even though I knew I hadn’t done anything wrong I still tried to be amicable tried to be nice to you and apologised for what I had done wrong in the relationship And what did I get in return Repeatedly told how I’m such a horrible person easily over 10 times I wouldn’t bite I didn’t rise to it I still tried to keep things amicable but you kept saying it over and over again I even offered to go for a coffee with you reminded you a week later that the invitation was always open to which you told me “what the hell was that about” Yet after all that you treat me as if I’m the bad one as if I’m the worst human being alive for ending it that night Because I refused to bail on my family when we had something planned for weeks and you knew I was excited about it and you had to cause another fight on the way there and then told me you weren’t going to go in and you were gonna get a taxi home Even 3 months later I try and reach out to you just to talk because I stupidly still love you Despite how you made feel despite how you treated me And I can’t even get a single one worded reply instead you block me on everything  The thing you don’t know is that after we broke up I had to go to the doctor and now I’m on antidepressants You knew I was on the edge of depression but you pushed me so far that I reached tipping point I was a state 3 months I suffered every single day blaming myself for what went wrong believing what you said about me that I was a horrible person and barely being able to look at myself in the mirror I hated myself and for what For someone who couldn’t love me the way I loved them couldn’t appreciate how much I did and cared for them For someone that could so easily turn their back on me and jump straight into another relationship Yeah it’s none of my business if you see anybody else at this point but the fact you’re able to do it and the fact you’re flaunting yourself on Tinder says a lot I’m not on Tinder I’m not looking for a new relationship because I’m too preoccupied with trying to pick up the pieces of myself that you left behind Each day is a struggle but I’m getting stronger I’m gaining self confidence again I’m learning to love myself again and see that I’m not a horrible human being These are the things you should’ve helped me see not the things you should’ve taken away from me I’m getting stronger one day at a time no thanks to you And one day I hope you wake up and realise exactly what you lost what you pushed away That you realise how much I loved you and cared for you and how much I dedicated to you because by then it will be too

('K is a girl in my college org She was an applicant this year When we had our oneonone interview I felt a connection Not really romantic but someone I knew I would be close with Last month someone was leaving clues that there was a girl that had a crush on me After narrowing down who it could be I had a strong gut feeling that it was K And I was right The moment I found out I was instantly hooked My heart skipped *multiple* beats as if it was struck by Cupid This also happened exactly five years since a significant life event I thought these were signs I knew I needed to make a move because I\'ve had shitty luck when it comes to love never been in a relationship and rejected by two girls in college I didn\'t want to waste my chance So I told her I was interested that I liked her back We started talking regularly online Things were going well Unfortunately we never had a date She was always too busy and it was also finals month Not exactly great timing The school year had ended and no progress was made We were headed our separate ways without knowing what would happen between us This is when I knew something was gonna go wrong And I was right againFirst I find out that she\'s still really close with her ex They\'re basically best friends with a history I\'m gonna be honest I got jealous I didn\'t understand how she could stay close with him I was scared that they would come back together and I\'d be left in the dust So I confronted her She assured me that they weren\'t together anymore but she still loves him despite that She told me we would figure it out when we came back in August I was disappointed that I couldn\'t find closure but I let it go I thought I\'d be ok with it Turns out I wasn\'tThis is where I really fuck up On Tuesday we were talking in the morning Then I was suddenly blocked Before Tuesday she told me she would deactivate her Messenger due to a personal matter I originally thought that was what happened but when I asked a mutual friend K didn\'t seem deactivated So I really did think I was blocked Around an hour later I wasn\'t blocked anymore Then I got mad at her for being "blocked" I told her I\'d avoid her until August if that\'s what she wanted She really did deactivate at that time I could tell she was upset with the way I reacted I hastily apologized We haven\'t talked since I ended up removing her from my social media feeds so I could stop thinking about herI feel really guilty about everything I wish things didn\'t fall apart so quickly I got too emotional about the whole situation I shouldn\'t have overreacted I should\'ve trusted her to explain her side in due time and just waited like a normal person Now I can only hope things will work out in the end but I don\'t really feel confident in my chances with her anymore', 598802)
("Not going to make a throwaway for this Fuck it I'll be an open book Sorry if it's messy I'll admit: I am no wordsmith  I visited my longterm periodontist yesterday I met this guy in college I was 19 at the time while he was just a Dentist He was the first Dentist to *actually know* why the heck my mouth was so fucked All of the Dentist previously would just make me feel bad They would say that I wasn't brushing my teeth I wasn't flossing Etc I would exclaim to them that I was and it actually hurt really bad to do these tasks They never believed me They just kept scrubbing in my mouth making me cry each visit The pain was unbearableOne day I just had to find an office that could see me that day  I couldn't take the pain anymore My mouth was on fire I literally could not open my mouth  the pain in my jaw was so bad and my gums were so mushy and full of canker sores In comes my hero Dr He delicately helped me open my mouth when he realized I couldn't physically open it myself I remember crying so hard I take pain very well I grew up in sports and was a huge Tomboy but this hurt like fucking hell It felt like lava was sitting in my mouth and someone had punched my jaw repeatedly He took a small peak in and then told me how horrible he felt He could see all of the pain I was in He immediately told me that I had Oral Lichen Planus It is an autoimmune disease they think and only affects about 12% of the population He gave me a steroid cream to help with the pain and taught me ways to manage this incurable disease I was so happy I remember I started to cry I felt so relieved to have an answer I swore I wouldn't visit any other Dentist He was a saviorAfter a few years he moved officesI developed anxiety about seeing any other dentists I waited for years until this week to do something about my mouth I just turned 29 and realized I needed to step up my health game I could tell that my mouth was getting worse from never getting a cleaning/checkup I finally went internet sleuthing and found his new location JESUS SOOO FAR AWAYI made the drive in yesterday We laughed joked caught up and then he told me that I now have Erosive Lichen Planus I have a ^semi urgent oral surgery on Friday at 7:30 am We are taking out some of my teeth He has hopes this will help relieve some of the gums and he is going to take a biopsy he is worried that this time it could be cancerBut not only this I've been having problems with my vagina Yep Lol My gyno believed it was dry and itchy from the low estrogen birth control pills and gave me an ointment to apply Well The dry itchy vagina persisted Last night as I read up on Erosive Lichen Planus  I stumbled on Genital Erosive Lichen Planus The symptoms are too eerily similar I won't go into detail about the other symptoms I have related  but they are there Luckily they are not near as bad as the internet pictures I now burned onto my brain POOR VAJAYJAYS \\*weeeep\\* I immediately emailed my gyno to give her an update on all of this Erosive Lichen Planus stuff to see if she can help or give me a referral I want to get help before it's too late So that's it I'm just a bit overwhelmed upset and embarrassed over this stupid condition that I don't have much control over It's with me for life and will always hurt The best thing I can do is stick with my Periodontist and keep up I learned my lesson I just hope my biopsy comes back okay and I do not have cancer I'm worried sick I know I shouldn't stress until I have a result to stress about  but I am scared  &amp;#x200B;I guess if anyone is curious or wants to learn more because they might have the same issues here are some links I found that since this condition is sort of unknown  it's hard to find a lot on it Even the subreddit for Lichen Planus it can be on the skin  this is the common form doesn't have many users dealing with the oral side of things  [https://wwwcolgatecom/enus/oralhealth/conditions/mouthsoresandinfections/erosivelichenplanussymptomscausesandtreatment]https://wwwcolgatecom/enus/oralhealth/conditions/mouthsoresandinfections/erosivelichenplanussymptomscausesandtreatment [https://wwwdermnetnzorg/topics/erosivelichenplanus/]https://wwwdermnetnzorg/topics/erosivelichenplanus/", 598507)
