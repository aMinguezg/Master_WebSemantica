            "selftext": "Hey, guys! First time poster here. Can anyone give me some of their opinions in this matter? Recently, i have found this post and it made me learn a lot about video games addiction and very thankful since i have stopped playing video games now except the occasional 30minutes to 1 hour game once or twice a week, basically 1 LOL game, maybe 2 if i really have a lot of time. Now, my problems is now that i have stopped playing video games, i have this urges to buy a new phone (the expensive ones like Huawei mate 20, samsung s10) although, my samsung s8 works fine and does it job in all of the things I need to do for Youtube, netflix and for my job. Also, i've been inviting my wife a lot more to go outside and buy food or eat ina restaurant (i guess im stress eating now) . Before, none of these things matter, my phone was the best in my opimion although, there were newer models. Everything i need was in the house already, didn't matter if the food was delicious, really saved a lot of money. I wasnt that addicted in playing games though, maybe 4 hours - 5 hours a day. I could still do this while having job since I work at home. I am an online ESL (English as a Second Language) teacher. I don't spend any money in video games since I only play Leauge of Legends or games that i have pirated but don't even play those single players much. My question is do you think i should continue playing video games since it makes me escape reality a little and don't have to spend money in order to be happy or to get that dophamine people talking about that make you feel good? Or continue my rehab as a non-gamer or a casual gamer where I always have the urge to go outside and buy things, in general, do some fun things outside with my wife and son frequently?\n\n\n\nHope you guys give me your two cents about this matter. Thanks in advance for those who will comment. Please feel free to comment anything. \ud83d\ude00",

            "selftext": "I'm 22, guy, studying in university.\n\nWhen I was little, under 13, I used to be outside all day. I'd go to school until afternoon, go home, eat and then head straight out. We'd ride our bicycles, climb where we weren't supposed to be, it was a lot of fun.\n\nThen I got introduced to games. They were also a lot of fun, but the time I was allowed to play was **VERY** limited. The more I wasn't allowed to play, the more I'd want to. When I wasn't playing on the computer, I'd think about what I'd do when I get on. I was thinking what games I'd play or thinking about classes and builds in World of Warcraft. It slowly became the only thing I could think about and I slowly stopped going out less and less. Then during holidays when I was allowed to play as much as I wanted, I'd go completely bonkers. I'd play something like 12 or more hours a day. Looking back at it now it was insane. \n\nI was quite social and energetic but due to all of that my social life had went into the dumpster and lit itself on fire. My social circle became smaller and smaller, to where it's just a handful of friends even until now. I often wonder if all of that caused me to be the introverted, introspective person I'm today and what my life would have been if I hadn't been introduced to games. I curse that day.\n\nThen at 18 I went to university and finally there were no parents to control me so I completely went off the rails with games so I didn't use this opportunity to make friends. I even dropped out the first year, although that's not entirely due to games.\n\nThis brings me to today. I'm 23 years old with no social life because of the years I wasted. I no longer have interest in games. I uninstalled almost all of them months ago and the ones I have left I very rarely play. I was quite busy with my university work and exams lately so I didn't notice the boredom, but now that all of that is done, I'm starting to get super bored. I want to go somewhere so much. I'd kill for a group of friends I can go hiking, or camping, or go to the beach or awesome shit like that. But since I don't have any all I can do to kill the boredom is play games. I've been even thinking of resubbing to World of Warcraft, even though I was horribly bored with that game last I played it 1 year ago.\n\nSeems like the only alternative to that is to find a job somewhere in my city. But it will be some temporary job for the summer until I got back to university. Either that, or I'll go visit my mother in another city and go visit some doctors to deal with some minor health-related problems while I'm there.\n\nFuck dude.",

            "selftext": "Hi. I'm hoping it's okay to post about other people here. I think this might be the best place for help in this situation though. First, a few details. My brother is 18. High school graduate. Taking a gap year.\n\nI am concerned about my brother. Over the years my brother has always been a huge gamer. Nothing wrong with that. I am too, they're fun, I can't lie. But he does nothing else. He games 12 hours a day at least. He wakes up at about 10, stays in his room a few hours playing mobile games, moves on to PC games. Then console. He does nothing else. He was diagnosed with depression a few months back. Is in therapy. From what I've seen, no real improvement. The He has never had a job. Which, where I live, is really strange for an 18 year old. Doesn't have his license. He has never applied for either of them. He doesn't like to go outside at all. \n\nThe particular situation that brought me to make this post, happened tonight. I walked downstairs and he was crying. Obviously I asked what was going on. He said he didn't know what to do in life. So I was like, \"You need to try something new. You have been gaming every day, all day since you were 12.\" He basically didn't respond. Let me add, during this conversation he was playing a video game. I told him let's look for stuff. I said career test, but I really meant nearby jobs, colleges, etc. Just anything to get him doing something else and out of this funk. But he said no, because he was playing a game. A game, that wasn't even on, by the way. He was on a loading screen waiting for people to join. I kept basically begging him to turn off the game and look something new to do, he kept saying no. I asked why, and he shrugged. Then I said of he doesn't turn the game off I will. He started yelling about how I was threatening him. I told him he needs to be proactive, do something if he wants to get better (referring to the depression). We kept going back and forth, and I just got tired of it. I went to my room and said \"You don't even want to accept help or try to change. Have fun with your video games or whatever.\" This made him absolutely rage. He yelled at me saying \"This is why I don't want help from you! You are always forcing me to do things! Mom would never force me to do anything! You are always saying mean things to me!\" \n\nI just feel like he is stuck in a routine and doesn't want to get out of it. Sure, video he's are funi feel like it consumes his life. What do you guys say? Should I do something? Say something to him? To my mom? Is he actually just fine?",

But that begs the question; what is similar enough to digital gaming and the issues it causes that you should want to avoid it too? Should I avoid analog games that reward you for winning? Should I stop watching porn? Recreational drugs? Theme park rides?",

Hadn't played in over a year and even sold my gaming PC, but I still had the ps4. Naive as I am, I thought I bettered myself, got more disciplined and could handle playing from time to time. No harm in playing an hour or two every few days, right? So I bought God Of War. Big mistake. \n\nI'm about to finish my bachelor's degree, but I'm really close to fucking it all up again. The last 2 weeks I must've played a good 60 hours at least. Didn't study at all for the upcoming exams, didn't go to uni, didn't sleep enough and neglected my gf. And there's a number of other unhealthy habits that go along with gaming for me. It completely takes away my drive and even my desire to care for myself. I don't always bother to brush my teeth anymore, I order fast food instead of cooking and don't bother to workout or go out with friends. I don't know what it does to my brain and why other people seem to be able to handle playing these games just fine. It makes me feel like I'm just a shell of my former self. Almost lifeless. No goal seems worth persuing and everything pales in comparison to that awesome new armor set that I can get if I just play this game for a few hours.\n\nI dream about it and think about it throughout the day. My first instinct is to turn on the console when I arrive at home.\n\nI'm only really awake and present if I'm inside the game, all my other hobbies and skills aren't interesting anymore all of a sudden.\nI need to stop this and never look back, I just can't do it in moderation.",

When I got into the university, my goal was to study Medicine. \n\nNow the system in this university is that you study one year of bio/chem/biochem and then you have an entrance exam where they take the first 100 scorers. It's a very competitive university and you have to spend all summer studying for this exam. In that summer (2018), I wasn't admitted; maybe it was because I didn't study enough, maybe because I used to spend 1-2 hours daily on video games.  I continued as 2nd year biochem, but I feel this isn't my thing and my only goal is to study medicine.\n\nWhatever, the past is gone and now I have a second chance to study for this exam and this time I shouldn't f\\*\\*\\* it up.\n\nI feel like video games are taking a big chunk of my time. The thing is whenever I have nothing at all to do, I usually spend my time playing video games. I've tried to cut this by filling my time with new hobbies and activities such as volunteering for the red cross, but I feel like I am stuck in this cycle. This year I spent a lot of time on video games and I want to stop it, I know I won't uninstall my games and I won't suddenly stop playing, but I really want to make my parents and myself proud, I want to make something that I love and makes motivated.",

            "selftext": "So, I'm currently thinking if I should buy a console and would like some feedback on where to go since I'm finding myself at a crossroads. \n\nFor some background I used to be addicted to video games when I was in high school and early college. I used to play lots of games on my gaming desktop, but I kept feeling unfulfilled. I had bigger ambitions than wasting my time playing LoL and killing time on the internet. I would say I was addicted to gaming since I found comfort in it. Now fast forward to today I don't play like I used to, mainly because I found fulfillment in other activities. I've picked up skateboarding and reading recently and I like to hike, go out with friends, go to concerts, etc. I've also focused on my studies more and my grades are picking up too.\n\nSo now that I find myself on track with how I want to live my life, I question If I should buy a console. I enjoy playing single player games that tell stories and get me immersed in the world. And I'd like to play a few games that came out and are set to release in the future since they sound really cool. I still have the desktop, but I don't really touch it anymore for gaming. I also hate the feeling of just sitting there and seeing time fly by while kill time on the internet. So for that reason I'm giving it to my parents.\n\nSo now I'm left thinking If I should go back to gaming through consoles? I'd still like to experience some games, and I don't think I'd be able to play for large amounts of time. A lot of the time wasted was playing online games with my old gaming friends who I haven't talked to in a long time now. And I don't want to use the PC because I tend to find myself browsing the internet a lot on it.\n\nI'd really appreciate some input on how some of you would go from here. If you got this far, thanks for reading! :)",

            "selftext": "Hello, I'm Maku and this is my first post. If you can't tell, this is extremely important to me and I ran upstairs so quick with tears in my eyes as I'm currently writing this. I have a 16 year old older brother turning 17 in October and he looks 13 but so does everyone in my family myself included, sorry I'm wandering off. I am 15 and we are like twins. I actually understand him more than me parents and anyone ever will. He's my only irl friend and so am I. He has autism, but not the retarded kind. He's actually the smartest person I know and I love him so, so, so much. I will without a doubt bet my big right toe that he is smarter than Albert Einstein. I have that much faith in him. He gets flawless straight A's. He got held back in kindergarten because of anger issues (ofc they didn't even know what autism was) and he was born late getting held back another year. So, he was and still is in the same grade as me. I'm his little sister but I take care of him, carry his big backpack around so he has nothing to carry because he matters that much. We are so close, almost unreal type of close. Now pay attention. Because of his autism he doesn't feel love, now, not all autistic people are like this, I am autistic too but put others before me and love strangers. So my brother has no interest in girls or guys, or friends at all, and people see us as weirdos and he doesn't care at all. He was NEVER bullied. Nothing dramatic ever happened to him. However my whole family are naturally EXPECTED to get amazing grades. This year my brother and I were accepted to the sixth best school in Florida, if you get one D you're kicked out. He stayed up countless nights and got so sick over stress and my mom, dad, and I have to always do his AP world terms to help the poor guy out. So yeah he's stressed and goes to gaming. He has an expensive fancy monitor. He'd play 24 hours a day if he wanted to. My parents are strict and won't give up on him and it pains me that everyday we have to call him for 10 minutes to drag his mad ass to dinner, breakfast, and lunch. I mean yes he deserves it and I'd let him play as much as he wants had it been up to me. I talk to him all the time in school and try finding other interests but all he talks about is video games.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe has no other interests. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnly gaming. He can't feel love and he admits it, but idc because I love him more than my parents and the world combined and I won't let him go. I want him to be happy and not  see his veins popping out of his head of rage when he won't go to the movies with us like today. How is my brother going to survive through life? He is also anxious about what his future will hold. Please, I went on almost every post here and can't find one like my situation. He's all I have. Thank you.",

When I do nothing at all it makes my head spin and I get horrible anxiety.\n\nAfter about 10 minutes, the pain lessens and doing nothing starts to feel really good. I'm not cutting off my phone enough yet, but it's lessening every day. I'm putting a lot of effort into enjoying doing actually absolutely nothing because it makes it better for me when I do actual work. It's easy for me to feed my anxiety with working just like I did gaming.\n\nAnyone relate?",

I've reached 110 days once but I've fallen into a deep darkness during the last months in which I relapsed a lot AND played really a lot, especially binged after relapses.\n\n(I hope you all don't mind if I also mention NoFap, right?)\n\nI have a very long history with gaming. I gamed really a lot when I was a child on my PS3, my dad would buy me a new game around every second month to play..... (mixed with PMO of course). I thought, just until now actually that gaming is pretty good actually, mainly because I met lots of people online and socialized with them.\n\nBut it has become crystal clear for me, especially since the last months. I really do not enjoy games at all anyways, I just play it because I don't know what else to do. \n\nI was on a vacation in Tunisia and just returned today. I really loved and enjoyed live there, actively socializing and chatting up with nice chicks. As soon as I returned..... I simply felt such a \"big void\" that I actually played for the last 4 hours again, and I did not enjoy even one minute of it, even though I played with my friends and we talked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was very active in the gym until my pitfall - that is the only real hobby I have. I really love to socialize with people, but all of my friends are quite anti-social and I don't know what else to do...... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, any tips from you? Any suggestions of what I could do other than hitting the gym? Also, should be gaming for a few hours per week acceptable?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBest regards,",

I liked to play for fun and only singleplayer/stories. Never was a fan playing online.\n\nI have a great life,no problems,great friends,great job etc...\n\nI havent touched my ps4 over an year. Its been in the box for the last 6 months.\n\nIm wondering if i should sell it(dont care about the money i will make of).\n\nThe only reason im hesitating is because im telling myself maybe ill play a little during winter(but i didnt this last winter). The only games i played on my ps4 was gta 5,last of us and call of duty.\n\nI would like to play last of us 2 when it will come out. I like playing fps.\n\nIm wondering should i just sell it and rent a ps4 when i feel like playing or just keep it?\n\nI dont like the fact its collecting dust haha.\n\nI would like to hear your opinions.\n\nThanks \ud83d\udcaa",

My biggest obstacle: video games.\nBecause I am on my high school\u2019s esports team and a varsity player, I feel inclined to play games. Unfortunately, I hate league of legends (the game we play). Like all competitive games, I just hate the environment and emotions I get from the game. The problem is that I don\u2019t feel like I can stop because I need to get better for my team.\nNow my first solution would be to quit the team, but my friends are on that team with me, which leads me into my second point. Mose of my friends are hardcore gamers. Whenever I don\u2019t want to play, I always end up gaming because they are. It\u2019s really hard to avoid games in this environment.\nFinally, I just stopped enjoying games altogether. Like, I have a bit of fun playing casual games, but only in moderation, but long gaming sessions or competitive games leave me exhausted, frustrated, and with a sense of loss. I feel like my life is wasting away without me having any control over it. How can I get away from a seemingly toxic environment? I just want to be happy and out of my computer monitor.\n\nTLDR; friends almost all gamers, hate long and/or competitive games, and feels compelled to okay for team. Games lead to sense of loss and frustration.\n\nSide note: my other hobby is reading, but gaming takes me away from it. Also, this was kinda messy, so feel free to ask questions. Any and all comments are appreciated.",

            "selftext": "Hello, I am coming here for some advice and to vent. My husband is 29 and I am 24. My husband has always been into gaming since we began dating. After 7 years, it is getting worse. He\u2019s now depressed and plays anytime he isn\u2019t working. I don\u2019t know what to do at this point. He even calls out when he is feeling sad and just plays. He has already lost 2 jobs because of this. I have talked to him about it already and I understand he loves it and I understand that he thinks it makes him happy, but it doesn\u2019t. He just screams all the time and gets angry and if I go into his computer room he yells at me. I use to play games with him but stopped because I didn\u2019t like who I was becoming. Now I only play a little bit, I mean like maybe 3 hours a week, if that. He easily hits 50 hours a week maybe more and he doesn\u2019t realize it. He doesn\u2019t help me around the house, he doesn\u2019t cook, he doesn\u2019t do laundry, he doesn\u2019t go out. He is upset that he has no friends but he doesn\u2019t make an effort to go out and find some. He is upset that everyone around him doesn\u2019t play games anymore but that is just because they grew up. I understand he is the one that has to change his life but what can I say to help him get there? I want him to start going to the gym. I don\u2019t know how much he weighs not but I know a year ago he was 320 so he has to be hitting 350 by now. His mom is obese and I don\u2019t want him to become that. I am becoming depressed because of him and I feel that I can\u2019t talk to him because he just puts his headphones on, ignores me, and plays. He use to not be this person and I have told him that. I miss who he was. He thinks he can\u2019t change because this is who he is now. He calls himself a deadbeat but he is the one causing this. His depression is horrible now and I think he has ADD or ADHD as well. I know he is lost right now because he isn\u2019t doing what he wants to do in life but he doesn\u2019t want to go back to school and anytime he has tried something he just quits anyway. The only thing he doesn\u2019t quit is his stupid video games. Has anyone dealt with this on my end? And for people on his end, what made you want to change? Was it something someone said or just something that you decided? Thank you.",

            "selftext": "Hi,  \nI learned something from listening to dr. Jordan Peterson's podcast. I don't know about you but I always tried to figure out the right way to do things. I have had (and still do) issues that would keep me up at night. I was never the kind of guy who was oblivious about where I am in life. If anything - this makes a lot more sense now since I know that I am high in neuroticism - I worry way too much about stuff. And there's a lot to worry about. You are (in no particular order): \n\n* not a good student\n* bad with girls/boys\n* probably out of shape\n* your relationship with your parents is not what it could be\n* you probably don't read enough (if that's not a truism let me know ;) )\n\nIf you try to sum all of those up what you get is something alike _you are not everything that you could be_. And you know what you mostly will never be!  \nSo what is there to do about it?\n\nI don't know. But that's fine. When faced with something that bothered me I used to think really hard and tried to find the perfect solution. Which lead to more thinking, eventually giving up on thinking leading to inactivity and depression. I accept now that the probability that you figure out the right (or perfect) thing to do is almost zero. That might sound harsh at first but if you think on it, it is the most positive thing ever. Because what are the implications of there being no perfect way, no perfect choice? It does not mean at all that therefore you should simply give up; no it means the opposite of that. You could simply try something -and by that, I mean literally anything- to make things better. Admit to yourself that you won't be able to figure out the perfect path, for there is no such thing. Whenever you try something, pursue something you will learn something.  \nAnd now we are getting to the truly marvellous stuff. Whenever you try something new it will most likely not fix what you are trying to fix. But you will learn something along the way. And sometimes you will be 100% off. But that's not a bad thing! And you know why? Because at least you learned more about what not do in situation X.\n\nMy issues are no longer with gaming, that is luckily a thing in my past. But my life is still hard. I still haven't figured out how to meet women I am interested in, I am still not the student that I want to be. My ties with family are better but they are not yet what I need them to be. I have fought with depression and anxiety and still am.  \nBut what did change is my mindset of looking at things. I can recover a lot quicker from panic attacks. What I do is to simply make myself do anything without expecting it to fix my problem.  \nTo give some examples when you are really lost just start cleaning. You will feel better two hours later. If you do not believe me just try it.  \nSometimes this is hard to do, but I found that I can almost always make myself read. And I can't explain why but finishing a book feels like I actually accomplished something. Why that is, I don't know.\n\nTo sum this up. Don't try to figure out the perfect hobby or career path now that you are no longer playing video games. Admit that you most likely don't know what the right thing to do is and start exploring. You'll learn something along the way and who knows what could happen to you, who you could become.",

            "selftext": "Iv'e wanted a gaming pc my whole life. I'm 20 now and I built my first pc last year. I really only play one game at this point and that's rainbow six siege. In only three months ive put in 220 hours.\n\nAnyways, ive gotten into trouble in the recent past, and I should just say im getting my license back in a month. The problem is that I dont have a car. I did have a car, but when I was unable to drive I let my little brother use it to get to school. Some things went horribly wrong with that car (not getting into details) but it wasnt any of his fault.\n\nSo now i'm at the point where Ive been saving money but in the amount of time I have left I wont be able to afford a new car, so that means I need to sell my pc. \n\nIve been wanting to make lifestyle changes regardless, but selling it seems near to impossible to me at this point even though I know what I have to do.",

            "selftext": "So this is kind of a long story, I\u2019ll try to make it as short as possible. TLDR at the bottom, not sure if this subreddit needed a specific format for posts but here we go. Please bare with me I\u2019m in need of advice, or just some people understanding or listening.\n\nLet\u2019s call my ex \u201cBlue\u201d. So Blue and I met first year of college. I was not into gaming on pc at the time. Then I was introduced later on and was really interested in overwatch. I started playing overwatch competitively and haven\u2019t stopped in 2-3 years now. I haven\u2019t reached my goal in sr and I don\u2019t want to quit until I\u2019ve reached it. \n\nI just really love the game. I love the art, the mechanics, and competitive mode. I love the team dynamic and leadership skills that I\u2019ve acquired. It\u2019s genuinely my hobby and I enjoy it and want to improve every day. If I have work to do I will finish but at the end of the day, I would like to treat myself to playing some competitive overwatch. \n\nBlue and I used to play overwatch together. He would get extremely tilted at me, this includes yelling at me over discord, waking his roommates up. We\u2019ve had fights over it because I wouldn\u2019t listen to his play calls or play exactly how he wanted me to play. So I stopped playing games with him that are pvp since he\u2019s very competitive and terrifying when things don\u2019t go his way. And I wanted to climb on my own because I wanted to reach my goal, in my way. \n\nWe broke up because of his anger issues and not treating me right. But now he\u2019s saying overwatch is what ruined us and wants me to quit/uninstall. And I just don\u2019t want to because I haven\u2019t reached my goal yet. And it\u2019s just so pressuring and nagging at the back of my mind that this game possibly ruined us? Even if I don\u2019t think so, he makes me kinda feel bad about playing. But it sucks because overwatch has been one of the things in my life that brings me joy and it\u2019s very important to me.\n\nI just don\u2019t know what to do or where to express my feelings. I might be on the wrong subreddit but I just don\u2019t really know where to turn to. I looked up \u201cmy bf is making me quit overwatch\u201d and there was a post on here similar but not quite. So I felt like I had to make a post.\n\nTDLR: my ex says overwatch is the reason we are over and that any type of relationship between us is ruined because of it. I don\u2019t think so and I don\u2019t want to quit either because I genuinely love the game and haven\u2019t reached my goal yet.",

            "selftext": "Hey all. I don't think I'll give up gaming completely, it's a big part of my identity. Lately though I've realised I spend such a stupid amount of time on video games. I spend hours on Overwatch and I get so stressed when playing.\n\nI have social anxiety and depression and have played games since I was young. I don't have many friends so gaming must have been a way for me to cope, and to pass time, when other people were out socialising. \n\nI met my boyfriend on WoW and gaming is a hobby we share to connect in our long distance relationship, so I don't want to give it up. I'm thinking maybe I'll just try and play only in the evenings, with my boyfriend. Playing with someone else makes me feel like I'm doing something more productive than when I'm sat playing all day on my days off.\n\nSo the question is, how else can I spend my time? I've turned Overwatch off and here I am, browsing Reddit. It all feels so empty. What can I do? The thought of learning a new language or volunteering sounds ok but I just don't have the energy. Depression saps all my motivation so everything seems overwhelming apart from quick matches of Overwatch to keep the adrenaline going..",

            "selftext": "I see a lot of people posting that are looking to fill the void missing from gaming. While its commendable a very good start that you quit, there is one problem. Replacing one time consuming problem with something else like the commonly mentioned \"youtube\" or \"netflix\" is just going back into the same pit but calling it something different.\n\nIf you have it set in your mind and your heart that quitting is right for you then there is something worth spending your time on. You've probably hit some sort of conclusion that your time is wasted on gaming so the obvious reaction is to not waste time. People say \"learn a language\", and while that IS a good thing to try if thats your thing, I suggest pursuing those asinine passions that seem \"out of your league\". A lot of people can't find the drive to just learn a language out of the blue. Try something different.\n\nFor me its been building bikes with the idea of losing weight and improving my style and my general appeal. The bike thing came as a result of wanting to lose weight, which itself is a reaction to realizing I was content and fat and sedentary in every sense of the word. That came with wanting to build a better me to crush my insecurity and social problems, and this all results from breaking up with my last girlfriend over a year ago and seriously looking at the kind of person I was. \n\nThe idea that is asinine for me is that I could take a shoestring budget and a mediocre food service job and make myself fit and stylish. Its created a knock-on effect that has led to me finding a passion.\n\nThe real answer is that you're not replacing videogaming  with another vice, this leads to the same problem as gaming but not gaming. You're replacing the content, lazy mindset with something better that moves you in a positive direction. Make incrimental changes. Look around your space, clean it, take stock. Make a schedule and try to be more accurate today than you were the day before. Step outside where you are comfortable.\n\nMost of us here are comfortable in digital worlds wearing faces that aren't ours in a sea of false accomplishments where we are always the hero. \n\nA lie.\n\nSo change that, change your mindset to where you WANT to learn a language, learn something related to your goals. Just learn something that YOU can use in YOUR life. Just have GOALS. Envision it in gaming terms if you have to, you take on mechanics and grind tasks to improve it. With improved mechanics you can access more options with the world around you, get better gear, cheaper. You improve your home, your car, your girlfriends car, a stranger's car, she becomes your girlfriend because you impress her, you get a job and rise through the ranks. So on and so on. Real tasks and real skills apply exactly as they do in gaming, it just takes discipline to unlearn that quick dopamine reward hit baked into your mind.\n\nChange your mindset and you won't be bored.\n\nDon't replace a habit with habit. Replace a vice with a GOAL. A reality. You aren't trying to find new ways to waste time, you're finding new ways to love your life you've been wasting.\n\nSieze it.",

            "selftext": "So I (28M btw) posted my situation here when I first stopped gaming and gave one update on it a month or 2 later. But I purge my post history on occasion, so the posts no longer exist.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy semi TL;DR story is that my ex broke up with me a few months ago and moved out. I quit video games partly as a last ditch effort to save the relationship, but I also recognized that it was a desperation play and even if she still left (she did) that it was a change I needed to make in my life. I was working a dead end job and our relationship was deteriorating. I lost most of my drive and ambition I had in college (when we met). Instead of facing these issues I distracted myself with video games and constantly claimed I didn't have a problem. Our relationship issues certainly were not just caused by gaming, but they played a big part in me never facing the issues I needed to in order to get my life back on track and save my relationship.  \n\n\nSince then I moved to a new state and am currently taking a course to undergo a promising career change. I hardly have any time for games atm, but I have thought about playing when my schedule lightens up. I have also played VR twice and just played a game with my roommate yesterday because he wanted to play. I didn't really feel bad about those instances. The first one my roommate's family was in town so he busted out the VR. It was a group activity and I had not experienced VR yet, so it was a good time. The second one I felt slightly guilty about, but not overly guilty because I was playing with someone. It feels like when it is a social thing it is fine, as long as I'm not binging it, and especially not solo.  \n\n\nBut today I booted a game up. I had no intention of playing it (and didn't) but I wanted to check something in the game that I was unsure about. I have this tendency with some games to try to plan out a playthrough/playstyle and I was curious if I did play this game what a certain attribute a build would have.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I booted up my roommates console I felt sick to my stomach. It felt like I was falling back into that trap of playing video games to waste my time and not doing something more productive. It's unfortunate because now I am afraid I might fall into the trap again when my schedule lightens up. I've still flirted with the idea of picking up video games much more casually than before, but that is always how it starts. I hope I can control myself",

            "selftext": "I just found out about this community today. I was already thinking of quitting gaming, and this community is reinforcing that.\n\nSome background info. I'm a 17 year old guy who has been playing video games since I wa little. I got started out with the Wii, then moved on to PS4 when I was 14. I have had severe depression most of my life, so it was easy for me to develop an unhealthy relationship with gaming. \n\nNow that I am on medication, video games are not bringing me much enjoyment anymore. I can barely sit still long enough to play them for too long. I'm getting very bored with them, and I feel like they are a waste of time. \n\nI want to be more productive. I want to hang out with friends, I want to go to the mall and meet new people, I want to get back into lifting, etc. I'm thankful that I no longer have to use videogames as an escape, but I don't want to sell them and regret it later. I easily have over $5,000 worth of stuff on and for my PS4\n\nMy Wii has a lot of nostalgic value to me, and I don't have the same addictive relationship with it as I do with my PS4. \n\nI just want some two cents on what you guys think. Personal stories of how selling or taking a break from gaming would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, and have a good day. \ud83d\ude01",

Im 18 and played videogames since I was 6 years old, and even I want to study game development or related things... I just threw on it a lot of money, Steam, Playstation, Xbox, etc... And the games for sure, and now I feel guilty for not playing them. This is really hard to write for me. I dont know how to get over this.\n\nThe videogames ARE(were?!) a big part of my life and routine, I cant accept that I dont like them anymore. I feel(felt?!) like they are the center of my universe, like the point of my life. Im explaining myself really bad, sorry.\n\nJust leave a comment if you think you can help me.\nFeel free to ask me ANY thing.\n\n Thanks and regards!",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone, I wasted 4,000 hours in 2 years on league of legends. Not proud of it and very ashamed to tell anyone else...\n\nIt was a normal Monday for me, coming home from school and planned to play league for the next 4h then sleep and repeat the next day. Well, the electricity went off for some hours and I had nothing to do until I realised that I am not addicted to LoL itself. I literally just have nothing to do and I\u2019m depressed so I\u2019m trying to run away from reality by occupying my mind with the game. \n\nLol is the perfect game if you want to waste time, 1 match goes on for 20-40 min and I\u2019m pretty sure the ranked algorithm is designed for you to keep playing more. \n\nBefore I played league, I had a job in a fast food restaurant and I had night shifts going from 4-12 pm so there was not much time to play because I was too tired and didn\u2019t want to wake my family up... but yeah, this was the realisation I had today. I don\u2019t have friends in real life or hobbies but if I had one of these, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019d forget this game fast.\n\nCan anyone relate? Do you think it gets easier after quitting and that your brain can actually start focussing and finding pleasure in other normal things? Thanks for reading :)",

            "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI'm a PC gamer and I wouldn't call myself a gaming addict. Gaming has never prevent me from engaging in other activities and performing well at school, but nevertheless, gaming has always been a main activity for me that I've either spent most of my free time engaging in or at least thinking about. I've never been a competitive gamer which led me to enjoy gaming's many positive and inspiring sides, like exposure to different periods in history in an interactive and immersive way (which has led me to apply for History in uni), as well as give me the opportunity to enjoy priceless stories and to deeply bond with characters, like Geralt of Rivia (The Witcher 3) and Vito Scaletta (Mafia II). I tend to be very passionate about my hobbies, even if they're pretty senseless.\n\nIf you've made it thus far you must be wondering what I'm doing on this sub. After all, I am not concerned about my gaming habits nor do I describe an awfully bad time with games. Well in fact, I'm not quitting gaming because I feel like it's a bad habit nor because I feel like I'm addicted to it, but for the simple reason I'm getting increasingly frustrated burnt out. I'm tired of the AAA industry and the likes of EA Games, I'm tired of insolent gaming magazines like Kotaku, Polygon and The Verge, I'm tired of getting disappointed by generic games time and time again because of budget constraints and lazy development and buying new 60$ games month after month. The days of spending months, if not years, on the same video game are long gone.\n\nSo, back to the title. I currently have a part time job so I find myself spending a lot of my abundant free time in front of my computer. As I've mentioned I am pretty bored with video games but I do play from time to time because, wellp, that's about all I do when I'm home in front of my computer. I really want to cut gaming off for good, which leads me to my questions - do you think switching to a Mac will help me in doing so, or will it be somewhat of a senseless investment? I bought a maxed out gaming beast last year and it feels like an utter waste of money to replace it with something equally as expensive yet far less capable.",

            "selftext": "First things, first. My name is Bruno and I live Brazil. I am a scientist with a PhD in immunology, working as an MSL for a big pharma company and I will marry my fiancee in 20 days. Turns out, my life is really great right now...but if you asked me if I believed things could be like this in 2012/2013, I would call you insane.\n\nHere in Brazil things are a little bit different, but they are also somewhat the same. My addiction to gaming started when I was 14 to 15yo (I am now 31yo), with Ultima Online. It was my first online game and I freaking loved it. It was my escape from the shitty reality I was living. My parents never understood my desire to follow a scientific career and I had a lot of trouble making friends during high school. The ones I had, I had because of our school scientific program and because I love playing soccer. Back then, games were more about fun and stuff, even tough I spent like 8 hours/day on games, if not more.\n\nBack in 2006 I started my graduation. Turns out I was never satisfied with myself back then. My family never approved my desire to follow an academic/scientific career and I never took my time to explain it to then. I was also involved in a toxic relationship that dragged itself for 2 years. Add to that that my family got into some serious financial difficulties and it is easy to see why gaming turned out to be the perfect escape valve. Even tough my grades plummeted down and I failed a bunch of disciplines, gaming was making me happy. I had friends there (and they turned out to be real close and cherished friends) and I had success there. My life was so frustrating  that the micro successes I had in games meant a lot for me.\n\nAfter finishing my graduation with a project that earned the highest grade in my class (which surprised me a little) I started my post graduation, first as a Master's and then as a PhD. This was the period I strained my life to the very limit. Here in Brazil scientists are funded by the government with only US$400 for an MsC and US$600 for PhD, which was nowhere near enough for me and my family. By that time I was so frustrated with everything that gaming was my only pleasure. Relationships were difficult because I was always broke and spiralling into alcoholism (I used to get back home drunk like 5 days in a week and go directly to my PC to end the night).\n\nIt was during that phase that I almost quit my PhD out of frustration. I was so stressed with my parents disapproval and frustration with the lack of funds and recognition within my career that gaming quickly became my sole focus. I played WOW, LOL, CS and Battlefield everyday, all day if possible, to the point that in the eve of my evaluation I went from 0 to 100 in a game instead of preparing myself for the said evaluation. \n\nNeedless to say, people around me started to ask me if I was ok, to which I responded I was only frustrated. Frustration quickly became depression and I was very reluctant in admitting that I needed help, to the point that I skipped therapy sessions to go back home and play games. At that point I had no envisioned future, even finishing my PhD was a big IF in my life.\n\nAt that point that I noticed what was happening to me. That I was frustrated with my life and that I was not taking any action to change that scenario. That games are designed to give you that feel of \"progressing\" without taking you anywhere. That, in reality, I was stuck in the same place for the last 10 years. The feeling of despair that I felt during that time in 2014 was so overwhelming that even tough considering suicide a sign of cowardice, that thought crossed my mind quite a few times.\n\nIt was during that time that I took notice of some lessons life was trying to teach me:\n1- the good thing about being utterly and completely lost is that every step, even if it is a wrong one, moves you close to not being lost anymore;\n2- changing requires changes and discipline;\n3- only you can help yourself, but having people by your side during that journey helps A LOT.\n\nIn 2014 I took a break from everything. I isolated myself inside of me to try and find why i was like that. It was nearly suicidal, leaving no stone unturned and being so self-critical. But it was the only way I knew.\n\nBy May-2014 I took the decision to change. The first thing changed was starting to enjoy myself a little more. I had huge self-confidence problems and addressing them first made it a lot of sense for me. It helped so much that in June I first met my fiancee. We met via tinder (it was a huge thing here in Brazil during that time) and she helped me a lot. She went through things like me and we both helped each other so much during those years, teaching each other and learning from each other.\n\nI also addressed all the frustration I had inside of me. Put all my strength into breaking all the wall I had erected between me and my family and friends. Admitting that I was weak was huge for me and that I needed help. Talking to my family helped a lot, too. We took a lot of time to understand each other and our expectations, goals and plans.\n\nBy 2017 I was so changed that gaming was again a past time activity. There were days that I felt the urge to play all day, but I knew that I could not only resist that urge, but focus on my priorities a d allow myself to use video games as a relaxation tool. I also stopped drinking, go the point that I went weeks without alcohol. I finished my PhD with merits and in 4 months started my first job earning what is the statistical wage here in Brazil.\n\nRight now, in 2019, gaming is just a past time, as is soccer, cycling and running for me. I leaned how to manage my frustration and anger and talk to people about my problems and listen to their opinion. Recently I got a new job in a huge pharma company (and my PhD was a decisive factor in the company's decision) and that job gave me the possibility to marry with the person that helped me become a better person. I have now a six digit yearly wage, my own car and house and I can help my family without cutting anything from my life. And that my experience might help others.\n\nI know people are different and what went right for me might not work for others. But if there's one thing that will never not work is trying. It might be scary, it might feel nearly impossible, but you should always try. Failing does not mean starting from scratch. Failing means learning and learning is always a step closer to your objective. I learned a lot during those years and I know I have a lot to learn yet.\n\nHope my story helps all of you trying to reach a better life and, if you want someone to talk to, PM me \ud83d\ude01",

I have been fortunate in that my video games have not stopped me from working out, getting internships, good grades, finding love, and pursuing my hobbies.\n\nFor a long time I convinced myself I am not addicted because I have all those things.\n\nI was wrong. I would play video games for 5-8 hours a day. I would think about video games frequently. I would play video games even when I didn't want to (that may not make much sense, but I'd often feel like I rather do something else but then I figured I should just play more)\n\nVideo games are beginning to take its toll on me. It has caused a lot of stress in my relationship. It has started affecting my sleep.

            "selftext": "TLDR; This is going to be quite a long post, mostly trying to get my thoughts out.  Long story short, I'm quitting my gaming addiction I've held since childhood, and could do with support and advice.\n\nFuck.  This is going to be hard.\n\nA little over a month ago, I quit a three year addiction to marijuana.  In that experience, the first week was hell, the second week was good, and it's been amazing since.  I've found it hard, but manageable.  I can the first major milestone the journey of self-actualization complete.\n\nThis one.   This one scares me.  I've been video gaming for as long as I can remember.  The first game I can remember playing is Nanosaur on the household mac.  I was maybe 5 years old.  I've played games pretty much ever since, and struggle to imagine life without them.\n\nI've gone through my steam library a few times in the past couple years and balked at the number of hours spent.  Worst offender in Steam is Kerbal Space Program with nearly 1400 hours.  I wish I could quantify time spent on consoles, too.  All in, it's easily over that 10,000 hour mark, probably twice over.  Knowing I could have mastered a couple skills in that time bothers me, but I can't change the past.\n\nLast weekend was a familiar experience.  I came home on Friday, opened up a game, then woke up to an alarm on Monday morning that came too soon.  I wondered where my weekend had gone (building a fucking virtual prison).  This seems to happen every weekend.\n\nI'm just exhausted of it.  I want no part in it any more.  In the past, I've always tried to rationalize ways to quit but not quit, and its never worked.  \"I'll just play after I finish my day's goals.\"  \"I'll only play on the weekends\"  \"I'll only play when it rains.\"  All lies to myself.  I played every possible moment, every waking hour where I wasn't at work.\n\nI'm so done I probably taste like a rubbery steak.  I'm just done.  When I get home, I'm uninstalling every single game from my PC.  Every last one.  I don't care about save files anymore.  I'll message my Starcraft team and tell them they need to find a new Zerg player.\n\nFilling the void:\nI could use some help here.  I'm well aware that when I quit weed, the hardest part was figuring out how to spend my time.  Then it was easy, I just kind of kept gaming, but sober.  But there's more than just a time void here.  Gaming gives a sense of satisfaction that I lack in life.  I love that feeling I get when I land a big ass mothership on a moon after 40+ hours of design and testing, plant that flag and set up shop.  It feels good to get that victory screen in Starcraft, and even better getting that promotion screen.  It was amazing when I hit that Diamond promo after all those years.\n\nI know what I want to focus on.  I want to become a writer.  That's my life's goal.  But that gratification is extremely delayed.  No victory screen pops up when you finish a story.  The closest thing is publication, and I'm well aware that could take years.  The hardest part of quitting addictions is the first month, I don't have years.  \n\nI also want to work on my physical fitness.  Again, it can take months until you begin to see gains.  I want that victory screen sooner than that.\n\nHow can I gamify my goals?  What methods have you guys used to get over the false sense of satisfaction gaming gives you?  \n\nAnd how do you guys manage the still mind?  A big part of gaming (and weed did this as well) was it helped me avoid doing emotional labour.  I would just let my problems melt away.  My flat isn't messy if I don't look at it.  My fuckups never happened when I'm staring at a glowing box.  I'm afraid that coming off games will force me to look at my life for what it is, and that pain will drive me right back in front of the games.\n\nAnyway, this ramble post has gone on long enough.  Thanks if you read this far.  I really would appreciate any advice/suggestions from people who have made that leap as to what methods they used / how they filled the empty time.  Thanks for reading.",

I\u2019ve struggled many years with depression and thoughts of suicide(ptsd) I\u2019ve learned To let them come in and flow back out, I\u2019ve had much practice meditating on these thoughts and feelings. Today on my walk, thinking of how to move forward, David Goggins voice popped in my head and said \u201cFailure is not a mother fuckin\u2019 option.\u201d This hasn\u2019t happened to me before, it felt powerful, incredibly useful, mentally practical. The thought I had following was a worry for others, when we become isolated and depressed the voice we hear in our heads is usually destructive, persistent, and repetitive. You are missing that person in your life who can check you back in to reality. But in my experience today, I proved to myself that I could be that person, and I believe you can too. \n\nPs I highly recommend you check out David Goggins on Audible and on Joe Rogan Podcast. If you want a free copy of the audible I can and will send you one, it is only free if you have not accepted a book from someone before. \n\nPeace and Love,\n-Alan.",

The collection of games are in my opinion complete trash. \n\nGames are actually being sold unfinished *with ongoing live services or dlc* which is a fancy way of saying well keep milking you for what we can, here's a new level cap.\n\nFalse advertising at E3 or whatever conference thing showing TRAILERS with promises and hype to get anyone with money to pre order, or pay full price for a bugged project that takes 250 ppl 7 years to get out the door. The amount of wasted resources these giants cause and then turn around and charge us for...\n\nMost games require you to invest anywhere from 50 - 200 hrs just to qualify for end game content. If someone else isnt paying your Bill's, how the hell are you doing that? WHY are you doing that?\n\nRefunds are nearly impossible. Progress in Games are almost always locked behind a stingey paywall, with content that either compromises quality with 4k graphics or a shallowed out story. \n\nFor it being latest gen - why the hell are there SO many 2D bullshit games? Why did we need such a CrAzY 800 dollar console to play fucking minecraft. \n\nFortnight is fucking garbage this is the most time I spent acknowledging its existence. \n\nRant over, fuck gaming, games + gamers.\nSit on your sweat stained couches, headset on, squealing energy drink face crystal meth drake listening pink haired mo'fo cant change a lightbulb.\n\nI regret playing games as much as I did.

I have been fortunate in that my video games have not stopped me from working out, getting internships, good grades, finding love, and pursuing my hobbies.\n\nFor a long time I convinced myself I am not addicted because I have all those things.\n\nI was wrong. I would play video games for 5-8 hours a day. I would think about video games frequently. I would play video games even when I didn't want to (that may not make much sense, but I'd often feel like I rather do something else but then I figured I should just play more)\n\nVideo games are beginning to take its toll on me. It has caused a lot of stress in my relationship. It has started affecting my sleep. I don't want things to get worse.\n\nSo hi everyone, I hope that I can have your support as I try my best to stop gaming.",

I can go all day not rage, or I can rage within the first couple games. Today however, on my first game of the day finally felt the full extent of my rage. I smashed my keyboard to where some caps are cracked, my Logitech headphones are in pieces, my monitor is cracked badly, and my mouse no longer works. I want to get some money for these items or at least recycle them so they just don't end up in the trash by my own hands. Speaking of hands out of my rage I cut my pinky deep enough that it almost needed stitches. My girlfriend is scared. I am scared. I don't want to game anymore and with it being such a big part of my life and one of my long term investments, I just don't know how to cut the cord or where to begin. I am probably gonna continue to game on my switch, mostly single player indie games, and maybe my PS4 to finish a few single player games. I am done with competitive gaming. I have been able to have a good mentality some days about losing and being flamed but Jesus today was borderline cyber bullying. I'm just done. I don't know how to cope or fill in the void of the competitive nature I have for everything. If there is any advice or direction please send it my way.\n\nTLDR: want to get rid of broken hardware and sell my PC. Don't know where to begin or how to cope. Will still play single player games, but need to stop my competitive gaming. It is not good for my health or relationships.",

It has severely held me back from kicking on and starting a life after education. I feel like I am only playing the game because it reminds me about when I was younger but it is stopping me from growing up. It has consumed my whole life. I feel like as long as i still play this game i wont truly begin to grow up.\n\nI really don't know how to stop. This game has taken over my life. Just now I lost in the game and got so angry I punched a hole in my bedroom wall. It is the first time I have physically felt sick, i can actually physically see with my own eyes what this game is doing to me.\n\nMany times throughout these 2 years I have tried to stop and for a few days i have, but soon I cant resist and start playing it again on my mobile phone and my laptop.\n\nAny advice?\n\nThanks",

                    "selftext": "I (26F) dated my ex (26M) starting when I was 16 and we married at 23 years old. Had I been a little more smart at the time, I would have realized that marriage wasn\u2019t going to make him start taking life more seriously. Now I\u2019m realizing his issue was an addiction he didn\u2019t want to fix. \n\nHe certainly played video games a lot when we first started dating. It was his escape from reality as he didn\u2019t have the best childhood and had serious depression plus anxiety. However, I was trying to get us both motivated to go to college and get decent jobs because one day it was to my understanding we BOTH wanted a house and kids- so we had to get to that place. \n\nIt took a lot of ass kicking just to get him to get his associates degree, and he ended up getting a job working from home in IT so it seemed perfect and paid decently at the time ($36k/year) and combined with my job it was enough for us to move out on our own at 22 yrs old. We had a deal to split the bills where he would pay rent and I\u2019d get absolutely everything else (food, cell, electric, internet, etc.) and it evened out. However, it was like that because it was most simple for him to remember. \n\nAfter living with him is when I found out how much time he actually spends playing video games: literally all day if possible. He would unenthusiastically go somewhere with me if I asked, but was usually on his phone playing a mobile game the entire time. \n\nHere\u2019s when I started noticing how bad it was. He had an L-shaped desk so he was playing WoW WHILE working. He would answer the call, but then turn his head to the video game computer and talk while playing the game. He would also make up some BS excuse to put customers on hold and THEN play his game for 5 minutes before returning to them. His boss never caught him on the phone recordings so he never technically got in trouble for that. However, his customer service ratings weren\u2019t the highest so he was getting the shit shifts and didn\u2019t get a raise for the two years I lived with him. He also used his all of his PTO immediately as it came in to call in for \u201csad days,\u201d where he was feeling bad, would sleep for awhile, but eventually spend the rest of his day in video games. I love to travel so this meant I wasn\u2019t ever going to have a full vacation with him since he can\u2019t save up his PTO. \n\nThere were also months where he couldn\u2019t pay rent because he bought too many skins/lootcrates that month- about $400 worth two months in a row before our wedding. It was clear at that point he cared more about his virtual reality world than the real one. It should have ended there. \n\nI felt a little bad for moving the goal posts as it was a miracle he got a job at $36k. After living on our own for awhile, I realized we were going to need to make about $50k each of we want to buy a house and afford kids in our area. However, he didn\u2019t want to give up the sweet gig he had because he wouldn\u2019t be able to play video games, but wasn\u2019t getting a raise, and wasn\u2019t applying to higher level positions within the company.\n\nAs far as therapy for his depression goes- he immediately dismissed talk therapy after going to it twice and decided that was never going to help. The pills never worked. He did a couple of ECG(magnetic?) treatments and they didn\u2019t work that well, so he just gave up. We went to couples therapy once and he said it was the same as talk therapy and it was never going to work so he didn\u2019t go back. He truly believed he needed brain surgery to heal. \n\nSo in my opinion- he wasn\u2019t there for me. He lied to me about wanting a house and kids. He saw how miserable his lack of motivation was making me so he suggested splitting up. I was actually willing to work on it longer but he wasn\u2019t. He wanted a life where no one made him feel bad about how he spent his time... so I filed for divorce... because he would have been too unmotivated to figure out that whole process. Finally after 1.5 years, I\u2019m concluding he broke wedding his vows to me. \n\nPeople made me feel bad for \u201cgiving up\u201d on him and maybe I should have helped more with his depression. However, I think back to the small daily details and brush it off because they don\u2019t know that it wasn\u2019t just the depression and video game addiction. It was also jealousy and not letting me leave the house on my own. It was also laziness as he never cooked a meal beyond the microwave. It was also lack of intimacy because you know, you fucking can\u2019t pause an online game and he\u2019d forget that I was waiting for him in bed. It was also a lack of sleep because he would be gaming, talking, and screaming to his friends until 3AM everyday. \n\nTL;DR: Ex prioritized video games over building a real life with me, and I\u2019m not going to feel bad about ending it. \n\nOn a happy note: I\u2019ve been dating this other wonderful man for almost a year now and he\u2019s the owner of his own business. He\u2019s so hardworking, is an ACTUAL adult, and video games are one of his last priorities of the day, and it\u2019s honestly so refreshing!!! We\u2019ve gone on a few vacations already and have more planned this year. It turns out I love going to places with interesting hiking trails!",

I am having inattentive adhd which is the opposite of hyperactive so i am very indifferent to everything around me, I am terrible at ball games and very bad when following instructions. This is unfortunately caused me to become an addicted gamer since it made me having hyperfocus and was easy unlike everything in real world. I believe that most of the  gamers having adhd.\n\nSo what is the solution? One is taking meds almost everyday like ritalin which will give you strong willpower and weaken the drive to play games but it kinda suck and sometimes will make you feel like shit. The perfect solution for me was neurofeedback which eliminates or at least minimize the adhd without meds. Personally i used attengo, you simply sit in your home with your computer and press the keyboard when the ball change colors. Beware it's fucking boring but you must do it if you care about yourself, listening to music makes it less of a torture.",

I am in no way an addict though. I never prioritze near anything over gaming, and I jump at any oppurtunity to do something different.\n\nBut why should it matter that instead of learning skills I'm \"wasting Time\" instead of doing other things? The things I want to learn are being taught in school through electives, or alongside gaming I'm doing this. I get physical activity, and I'm interacting with my friends and am,,genuinely happy.\n\nThis kinda sounds like I'm shitting on you guys, I'm not, I'm just asking if In your eyes this is a problem? I see people commenting things that aren't about fixing peoples addiction, and are just blatantly anti-gaming.\n\nI have nothing better to do, and who cares what I do in my spare time? Im heading to,a good place, and Im enjoying myself, and thats what life's about right?",

I would spend every minute not at school in my room playing league of legends or runescape.\n\nAfter year 12 it also got really bad and I basically spent 6 months in my room allday playing games.\n\nHowever, since then I have been gradually playing less games. \n\nI have stopped completely now for the past 4 months and feel so much better for it.\n\nI am graduating from uni this year, have multiple internships lined up and am working really hard to start a good career.\n\nThere are so many new things I am doing like consistently exercising, muay thai and camping. I also have new motivation to socialise and meet new people. I dont know I guess I just want to go out and experience the world\n\nI have reset my old computer and am getting rid of it and all the extras.\n\nLooking forward to creating a better life from here.\n\nThanks for reading, and good luck to everyone else.

            "selftext": "So it's Friday, 7pm and I did nothing of my afternoon. I had freetime that could've been used for work, drawing, etc but instead I just fought against my mind. I still feel like I love these universes. These characters, these lores, these mechanics, everything.\n\nI'd say that I'm more of a dreamer than an action man. I not only loved to play these games, but loved to imagine stories in these places, I always imagined stories in my head even before playing games. And right now I'm just finding other worlds to explore (W40k, GoT) to feed my mind. I watch films, read, but can't @'\")@\\^ing get to work, or do something else. I mourn my beloved universes, arts, character arcs, etc ... I went through the first step of not playing games for a few days but now I can't get to do something productive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI used to have these games to think about, now I'm just trying to not think about it by just being an empty shell. I never envied people that are partying and shit, working out like madmen and wearing trendy clothes like that. I just like to be alone sometimes, to do my shit. Unfortunately it has showed to be incompatible with work and other basic bullshit, as I'm playing games most of the time. It's my culture and I was shaped by it, been in these fantastic universes and creating stories with Legos and just my mind when in bed since day 1. Do  I have to kill my self past and basically be an empty shell for the next year ? I'm studying and shit, projects are exhausting and man it has been hard some nights to not just have *fun* for once.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMan I miss my games, I can't imagine myself enjoying life without them. It's only day 4 or 5 and I already start to tell myself that mayyybe only on weekends It'd be reasonable, mayyybe if I do my work I can reward myself with games...I'm 20yo and couldn't control myself until now, so I just lost what I love : being a super soldier in space, following the story of fictionnal characters, damn I really enjoyed playing even solo campaigns, I feel like I replaced all these fricking books I used to read with games but slipped to the side of mindless playing...\n\nMy dad told me \"you're not introvert, you just never learned to make friends\", or \"you are an action guy, you just stopped going to sports trainings because you wanted to play games instead\". I'm lost now and don't know who I am. I was very enthusiast at first but I realized I may have lost something bigger than I expected...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hate myself for not being able to control myself and do basic chores around the house, for neglecting my school work although I had decent grades, and I hate that I spent so much time on these games only to lose them right after. But now that I think of it, I used to read for 5 or 6 hours straight when I was younger...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDeleting accounts was easy. Uninstalling games was easy. Uninstalling discord from my computer was easy (still has it on phone, I want to keep in touch with my friends). Then I needed to unistall Reddit from my phone because I was replacing my play time with scrolling. Now I just read all the afternoon. If I delete my games, yt channels, music (associated with gaming 100%), interests, hobbies, do I delete my identity ? Do I have to rebuild a complete identity from scratch ? During my engineering school years ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm fucking lost and I will probably call my parents right now because they are supporting me and can help me through this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy couldn't I be one of those who can work, do chores and then enjoy games for an hour before sleeping ? Replacing games with books won't do my work, and I am afraid of the upcoming weekend.",

When i started college i started to play tekken7 and my will to become pro got really big again. I've been playing for 2years now and i have become really really good at the game. I've had success in tournaments, im the best Jin (a character in the game) player in my country, korean pros told me that my Jin is very strong. I would like to compete internationally but I know that I will consume time that I dont have. There are already so many things that I have to fix in my life + i study computer science and that is where i should spent all my time instead of playing tekken.\n\nI really dont know what to do. Everybody says \"follow your dreams\" and ive never been closer to my dream but i know even if i become the best in the world it would never be enough to pay the bills. And i fear that i will regret it if i quit...",

            "selftext": "tl;dr shut down steam and just read it you loser\n\nHello everyone, KagoKija here.\n\nA year ago I quit gaming.  I went completely cold turkey one day, not telling anyone I had quit.  Life has improved demonstrably.  So here are some tips:\n\n**Identifying that you have a Problem**\n\nConsidering you\u2019re on /r/StopGaming, congratulations!  You\u2019re one step closer to stripping this insidious hobby from your life!  Recognition is the most important first step.\n\n**Do not tell anyone goodbye**\n\nDon\u2019t post onto stopgaming youre gone - go back to it later post your results when your life has gotten better.\n\n**Take off your headphones**\n\nDo this to clear your mind and avoid temptation from doing any of these things half assed-ly.\n\n**Look around your room**\n\n**Evaluate what gaming has done for you**\n\nGrab a notebook and a pen and write half a page of the benefits gaming has provided.\n\nThen write down a half page of all of the negative negative things gaming has introduced into your life\n\nFinally, end on a good note because you don\u2019t want to be a negative nancy so write down two lines on good things about gaming.  This is a happy divorce.\n\nThis notebook will come in handy later.\n\n**2 step complete annihilation process**\n\nYou want to completely rid yourself of gaming influence.\n\nRemoval of direct gaming systems:\nBegin by deleting Steam, Origin, Battlefuck whatever it is.  Remove it all.  \n\nRemoval of indirect gaming systems:\nPurge your social media, youtube, web browser, bookmarks, create a new Reddit account, skype, video game posters in your room, computer background\n\n**Having a Way Out**\n\nSo now what can you do for fun?  Everything which gave you a \u201cmeaningful\u201d fix of enjoyment is deleted.  There is no best way to go about life now - unlike video games there is no one set path to success.  There is no OP gun, OP character, on rails A - B path.  Do whatever it takes to have you not be on the computer wasting time - anything (no, not porn) is good enough if quitting gaming is your objective.\n\nStep 1) Take a 10 deep breaths.  In 5 seconds, out 5 seconds.\n\nStep 1.5) Be bored.  Then use that notebook.  Write in it.  Write, write, write.  Do some drawings and doodles.\n\nStep 2) Get a book.  Short stories, best seller, self improvement, whatever.  No Im not going to tell you how to read or what to read.  A high school book you didn't read because you were too busy gaming.\n\nStep 3) Move your computer or laptop or change it in some way.  Your mind has learnt to associate \"computer good, very fun\" instead of \"computer good, very productive\".  Change these associations.  Move the monitor around, move the desk, just something so you aren't in exactly the same spot.\n\nStep 4) Go to the gym.  I don\u2019t give a shit if its 11am and you have things to do.  Go to a gym.  No, don\u2019t look up videos of training routines.  Just go to a gym, ask for a PT and get a plan going.  They will help you, it\u2019s their job.\n\nStep 5) Start building hobbies.\nOnline courses on how to draw a snail eating a shoe, indoor rock climbing, dancing, cooking, programming, cleaning your fucking room - starting with that filthy keyboard and monitor.  Whatever so long as it isn\u2019t video games.  Create new social media profiles to document new things!\n\nStep 6) Thank me",

Weekends are treated differently but I still expect him to have a balance between gaming, screens and physical activities, or just reading, drawing etc\n\nIt hasn't always been like this, I've given him benefit of the doubt in the past allowed him to try and balance it himself (didn't work) even though he's promised to limit it. \n\nI understand video games or media content pulls you in, makes you happy, takes you away from real life but I expect a balance. \n\nI feel bad and think am I being too controlling and question my decisions or am I being a narcassist? \n\nFrom your perspective am I being too harsh? Did your parents try and find a balance with you? Do you wish they did?  \n\nI had an episode yesterday with my son, he knew he had to come off at 5pm to do something different but he persisted stating that other parents aren't like me and his friends are allowed on screens unconditionally. It might be the case but I know there are parents like me, even more conrolling than myself. \n\nIt resulted in him kicking right off and me conviscating his devices for the forseeable. \n\nI honestly sometimes feels like why did I ever introduce him to the wonderful world of gaming. \n\nI know there's no simple solution to this, I wish there was. \n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts on this. \n\nThanks,",

            "selftext": "I stumble upon this reddit due curiousity and keep finding a lot of similar posts where addicts dont know what to do when they stop playing video games hence they go back.\n\n\nToday i will give my insight how i stop video games years ago. The first thing you need is to have goals. These can be achievable goals within next week or years. These goals just have to be realistic. If u dont have goals to pursue then there 's no motivation to stop gaming. Read this article( https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/25/retired-navy-seal-use-this-5-step-strategy-to-achieve-any-goal.html) as it's more in depth on achieving goals. The next thing to do is stop the game environment from getting to you. This can be done by selling your games or console so it will force u to buy it again if u have the urge. If u have peer who plays video game explain to them u want to stop and ask them to not discuss about video game around u. If they are also an addict and wont comply with your offer then drop them as they are a problem too.\n\nNow that you some clear goals and u deleted the source of the problem, u will achieve more things in life.",

Then, I quit another job by not showing up on the first day. The only thing saving me now is the fact that I'm in a construction union. I've been looking furiously from job site to job site for about 3 days now, unfortunately being rejected every time. Gonna keep at it however. \n\nI haven't gamed for about 4 days now, after coming to the realization I have no job, and no savings left to allow myself to feed a chronic addiction. I've reflected on how many times I've fucked up in the past (dropping out of school, quitting jobs just to play games, etc.), but I can't stop thinking how I even got myself to this point. I've just completely lost interest in gaming. Real life really did become more important. \n\nI feel like this post should be in /r/homeless, but I'm pretty sure I'd get bashed there so hard and probably wouldn't get any helpful advice (since this is 100% my fault). \n\nAnyone else have a similar story?",

            "selftext": "I woke up on April 22nd, 2019 and got ready for work just like any other day.  After washing up, I sat down at my computer to check my work email, when I suddenly realized I had forgotten it was Easter Monday, which meant I didn't need to go into work since nobody else would be there.\n\nAn entire free day to myself! Awesome, I though to myself.  I had no errands to run and I was all caught up with work, so I could just spend the day relaxing.\n\nI mulled through how I could spend the day.  Most of my friends were out of town, so I couldn't call them up to hang out.  I was sore from hitting the gym yesterday, so any physical activity was ruled out.  That's when the idea popped into my head -- Why don't I re-install DOTA and play for a day!  I'll uninstall at the end of the day.\n\nIt seemed like a great way to pass the time.  BOY O BOY, was that a dumb idea.\n\nHaving first quit gaming on Dec 1, 2018, I had made it 142 days.  My life had gotten markedly better.  I was back in shape.  I was more productive, making steady progress towards my work and life goals.  And, overall my mood was more positive, more relaxed, and happy.\n\nSurprise surprise -- here I am 45 days later, and I've just spent the last month and a half gaming 6 hours a day.  My workout regimen h as dropped off a cliff.  I've gained weight, and my work productivity has dropped off a cliff.\n\nVideo games are like crack to me!  The little dopamine hits I get every time I accomplish a small goal in the gaming world are intoxicating.  And, it feels great to escape into the gaming world where there's no real risk and I can just experience the state of being in flow.\n\nBut, the trade offs are obvious.  There are many other things that I value in life besides being in flow.  And, ALL of these values are pushed to the wayside when I play video games all day long.\n\nSo, I MUST QUIT.  Today, I'm planting another flag in the sand.  I'm saying NO to gaming because it's such an AMAZING and ADDICTIVE experience that I can't fucking draw myself away from it.  And, as a result, my life falls to shambles.\n\nI choose a well-rounded life where I steadily work towards achieving my values instead of the temporary reprieve, that is gaming, where my life inevitably crumbles before my eyes.\n\nHERE IS MY MESSAGE THE NEXT TIME I'M BORED AND CONSIDER RE-INSTALLING: YES, IT WILL BE A TON OF FUN.  YES, YOU WILL END UP GETTING ADDICTED AGAIN.  IF THERE OTHER THINGS IN LIFE THAT YOU VALUE MORE THAN A POSITIVE MOMENT-TO-MOMENT EXPERIENCE, YOU ARE GOING TO REGRET RE-INSTALLING.  YOU WILL BE LESS HAPPY OVER ALL.  SO DON'T FUCKING DO IT, YA DOLT!",

            "selftext": "Imagine this.. Doing something you love, making a living out of it hence it's not destructive. WOW sounds fucking hard, even equates itself with impossible.. at least by societies standards. Common problem when quitting games is that people, yes, take up new hobbies but none of them really .. huh.. touches them. What excites you? What makes your heart jump a beat, what makes you eyes lit up like when you were a kid and saw your first video game? **WHAT TICKLES YOUR FUCKING BALLS? or breasts =)**\n\nRemember when you were a kid you wanted to be SOMEONE wether that was an astronaut, scientist, street racer, rockstar etc. As kids we dream big. But society brings us down, our parents, the elders they tell us NO NO NO you can't be a rockstar, you won't make it only 1 % makes it, you need luck and talent! Go to school, finish university, get an average job, save 10 % each month from your salary and invest in the stock market. They bring us down via **SOCIAL CONDITIONING**, they grab our heart full of dreams and take a shit on it. As underdeveloped individuals we look up to people with more experience, trust them and listen to them, we look up to them hence we live up to their expectations and don't listen to that voice in our, our calling, had which had been shut down by social conditioning. Be more selfish, make it about you. It's your life and you are living it for yourself not for your parents even if you love them so much and they've done everything for you, it's your life. So ask yourself again.. What does make my eyes lit up? \n\nMainstream problem upon asking this question is that you are all over the place. Everything is interesting to you, but nothing is, truly, interesting enough. Simple solution. Pick something and put all the eggs into one basket. Go for it! Risk it!  But people ask themselves:\"OHH what if I fail?\". I mean if it's the wrong basket, just pick another one.. Your eggs will be fine, just switch that mofo out.\n\nHow would you present the act of living visually? Let's say we use a cardiogram for out example (you know the line in the movies that goes up and down as your heart beats). So you are dead when you line is flat right? Those spikes, ups and downs, represent your life journey. **YOU HAVE TO FAIL AT LIFE RIGHT?** Because if you never fail, you never win. If there is no failure there is no success, just like if there is no good there is no bad, if jign doesn't exist neither does jang. And if the line is flat.. Do you even live your life? Failing is good, it's a lesson, just like succeeding. If you fail you have a story to tell, a cool fucking story, a story when you maned up grabbed yourself by the balls and put yourself out there! Be afraid of the routine, of your comfort zone.. expand, grow.\n\nIf you had 1 year to live, how would you act in life? How would you live knowing you'll die in 365 days? You would live to the fucking max! **PEDAL TO THE METAL!** Be afraid of death, mediocrity, comfort, not failing. If your dream career isn't really possible, be creative. Find the key characteristics in your dream passion and  figure how would you get that qualities from another career. Dream big, go all out! There is no worst case scenario, actually there is and let me tell you what it is. It's your comfort zone. It's where you are right now, and if you stay there for the rest of your life, if you don't grow, that is will be your worst case scenario. People will try to stop you from pursuing your passion because they see you, going for what you've always dreamed about, and then they look at themselves doing nothing about their dreams. You were born with a disease and its **DEADLY!** You might die right now, reading this, maybe tomorrow, the day after or in 50 years, doesn't matter you will die. And that disease is called **LIFE**. So go ahead and live up to your full potential!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you came all the way here, thanks for reading. Knowing that I inspired one individual is more than fulfilling for me. I'm starting of as an video game addiction consultant, and if you have any questions, struggles or want to let go and exhale your story that has been building up feel free to contact me. We can jump on a call , assess your situation and see if I could HELP you. I'll provide services for couple of my first clients for free, so jump on the value train. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Keep your head up! Cheers,*\n\n*Filip.*",

I'm excited because it's going to allow me to pay down student loans more effectively.\n\nHowever, I'm nervous about the job and whether I'll work out because it has a 6-month probationary period.

You are still wasting your time either way. It is like you can even play with dirt and would be no difference, because you are not achieving anything in either ways.\n\nSo I started realizing that kids play video games, and spend less time or more doing the same thing as us.

            "selftext": "I knew I needed to quit video games, but every time I would try I would end up just staring at my ceiling thinking \\*I might as well be playing video games\\*. I got to a point in my life where I knew it just had to happen and when I opened up my web browser to search for help I had a choice, I could search for psychological articles, or go to Reddit. The initial Reddit article on this page spoke to me so powerfully, I was able to quit the same day. I went to bed early, got up at 430 am full of  energy and excitement. I went to yoga, after yoga I went to the gym, after the gym I went for a run, after my run... I actually took the time to sit down and talk to my room mate, set up netflix on the living room tv and we watched Limitless together. I'm happy that I'm moving forward, but I'm sad when I look back and wonder what it was all for. So much escapism that I forgot how to be a real human being and truly enjoy my life. I was using gaming as a crutch for isolation and depression, not realizing it was keeping me stuck. Fat Bastard said it best, \"I eat because I'm sad, I'm sad because I eat.\" Maybe it is a blessing, like when you brake your legs and cant walk, you really learn to appreciate them. Words cant describe how big of a turn around this is for me, it sucks that it took so long but honestly I'm too excited to give a damn. Whenever I don't know what to do and feel isolated, I go to the gym, I go for a run, if my legs are sore I walk, miles and miles, I go to yoga, I read, I play guitar, I can feel my soul coming back. Not even to mention the strangers staring, smiling, and welcoming conversation. Maybe I didn't notice it before, or maybe something inside of me has changed drastically. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you from the depths of my heart .",

            "selftext": "**My take on games**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I'm not one to think that video games are bad, I personally think that too much social media, things like YouTube, Twitter, PornHub, and the likes, are much more time-wasting and addictive than video games, but I believe it can vary for different people.\n\nI've actually seen and played games that have a positive benefit for me: Games like Minecraft let me express my creativity and ingenuity, since I can't afford many other ways of doing that. I would even like to learn how to sketch so I can sketch out building designs on blueprints irl and use them to build things in Minecraft.\n\nAlso, I find games like COLOBOT (an old programming game) great! I've played with several other games before, and they never held my attention for more than a week, and although I also lost some interest in COLOBOT, it was one of the few games where I got excited when playing it. Every time I successfully programmed a robot to complete a task, I felt myself growing.\n\n I like games that let me practice traits that I want to work on, like strategizing, planning, creating, building things, and socializing. For that reason, I like playing games like Minecraft, COLOBOT, RTS games, and some MMORPGs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut that's when a thought popped into my head: If I don't have the time or the money to play a certain game, why spend time trying to play any of them?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The epiphany**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt occurred to me while I was trying to decide which MMORPG to play. ArcheAge has a rich, massive game world, but it's not the real world that I'm trying to get to, and ArcheAge is a huge time commitment. I barely have time for something like that because of family, job searching, and a Fullstack Web Developer bootcamp I'm taking online.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, the point I'm getting at is, it kind of seems pointless to muddle over which games to play, when there's over thousands of them on PC alone, and I hardly have the time, money, or space to play even a fraction of them, so I might as well just pick the ones that let me practice and have fun doing something that can be applied to real life in some way, and forget about the rest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I still get hung up on what MMORPG to play. Why is that? Almost every MMORPG I do play, I get bored because it's repetitive grind until the level cap, and then once I get to the level cap, I find out that the rest of the game is just upgrading gear, more grinding, but with mostly toxic higher level players. Then the REAL good games with more to do take too much of my time. So, why?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's a bunch of incomplete thoughts and I apologize for this text dump. I'm just trying to figure out why I get hung up on some games and hung up on YouTube. I don't really have any social outlets where I live, which is why I play games, and why I'm working on becoming financially independent by becoming a freelance web developer.\n\nI guess my conclusion for now, is to play the game that best suits my temperament, and gives me a chance to express myself and share creations with others. Games like Minecraft, and Trove. But Trove is probably a bad choice because it's addictive and novel by very design.",

I fear that the cheap dopamine is messing with my brain, and all the lost hours are damaging my health, relationships and hygiene. \nIt's just that I've yet to thing of something to replace my wind down with.. It'll probably be a bit shorter than if I were gaming, but I do need some time to let the work adrenalin dissipate. The usual suggestions don't really apply all that well to me. I'm home from work at around 11-12 pm and can't really go to bed before 2 a.m. We don't have all night gyms where I live, and to be honest, I'm happy to be off my feet after work. If I go read a book, my head will get drowsy but my body still has the work energy, so I'll go to bed only to wake up after an odd couple hours, or just have bad quality sleep. Watching series feels too passive most of the time. I'm not really focussed or wakeful enough to pursue intellectual or creative interests.  \nAny suggestions?",

            "selftext": "Here you are browsing this subreddit looking for advice.. You've recently quit gaming and if feels terrible at first maybe even scary. Since you've been gaming for most of your life, having this much free time on your hands is unbearable, such time abundance is not comfortable, not that there is something wrong with discomfort, actually it helps you grow, but YOU are not used to it. Feeling fucking lost and because your reality was virtual for past years and the real world feels like an illusion. Questions like: Who am I now? What should I do with this time? What is my purpose? Is life like this, without video games, even worth living? keep popping into your mind.\n\nBeing a gamer was your identity. It was who you were and since you've invested so much time into it, it became the only thing you did! It gave you a new social circle, sense of purpose, rewards for going after it and an instant escape. Quitting video games leaves a gap of the 4 things mentioned above that needs to be filled in order to quit successfully. After quitting you are in search for a new identity, There is a mechanism that your brain uses to help you build an identity. Imagine your brain like a soil in which you plant a seed. That seed is an idea of what your new identity is. If you water your seed every day it will grow in a plant. In the beginning it requires more attention which means if you maybe forget to water it it will die and maybe sometimes it needs to be moved on direct sunlight and given some plant food. After a while it grows big, strong and capable to feed itself and to produce some apples let's say. Let's say you like skateboarding culture and you would like to be a part of it. You start reading about it and consuming the content of skateboarding subculture. The seed has already been planted with the first thought of you wanting to be a skateboarder and by making the subculture topic something common in your life you slowly start being a part of it. There is a part of your brain called RAS (reticular activating system) in your brain stem and its main function is to filter unimportant info.. Since you've planted the seed of a skateboarder RAS let's the information about it pass through. What it also does it automatically fills in the other parts of ''skateboarder identity''. At first you've consumed the content and started wearing the characteristic clothes and what RAS does it fills in the empty spots and helps you build an identity. WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT YOU BRING ABOUT. Of course if you just think positively you will not be happier and positive, but you need to EXECUTE too. Take ACTION my friends, just baby steps and things will fall into your lap. \n\nRemember people praise the events. A football star made a 10 million contract, Donald Trump became a president (this is just an example, no political preference), XY became a rockstar, young programmer made millions etc. People look at events and focus just on them like quitting games. The process is important and the event is just the result of your hard work. All these people above focused on the process and worked their ass off. Sweat, blood, tears and sacrifice. In the end it payed of. So my friends enjoy the journey, that is the only way to freedom. \n\nP.S. I'm an ex video game addict, managed to overcome my addiction and I've built enough self discipline and will power to even play video games casually if i feel like it. Currently I'm working on a personal project with a mission to help the same person that I was couple of years ago. I'm starting as a video game addiction coach and consultant and I am willing to provide the first couple of my clients with my expertise for free. So hop in the value train if you have any unanswered questions, struggles or you just want to share your story with someone. Feel free to contact me via comment section or private messages. \n\nEnjoy your journey and keep your head up!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFilip",

I\u2019m trying to predicate every action I make with asking myself whether or not it\u2019s a good decision, and I can\u2019t figure out if video games is an actual addiction or not\n\nI\u2019ve really never played them moderately, I\u2019ve stolen for video games, I\u2019ve snuck around to play video games, and it\u2019s really been my only past time\n\nI quit playing when I got into drugs and alcohol and partying but after that all ended I found my way back to them.  I didn\u2019t play much on heroin I just nodded out while watching tv\n\nBut when I got into meth all bets were off. I was staying up a week straight playing league. I didn\u2019t need to eat so it didn\u2019t make my self esteem go down by eating like shit and getting fat.\n\nWhenever I stop gaming I get in rocking tip top shape physically but only like once have I successfully been exercising while gaming and I\u2019m not even sure how long that lasted.\n\nI go to a 12 step program for drugs and alcohol but noone can relate to me with gaming. I\u2019m hanging out with these dudes who would fish and catch snakes and play the guitar. These people got life skills while growing up with their addictions\n\nI didn\u2019t get shit. It\u2019s like this dude I knows can sing and play the guitar and can probably make a career out of it if he tried because that\u2019s what he did in his free time aside from drugs. I played league so a huge part of me wants to take the only thing I\u2019ve put time into and want to try streaming and make a career out of it but I don\u2019t know if video games is an actual addiction for me like drugs are\n\nI know I can\u2019t do drugs ever again. I never want to go back to that place I was in, but I can\u2019t say the same about gaming and Boone can relate to me in the 12 step program I\u2019m in. \n\nI want to play league SO much. I just don\u2019t know if doing so will make me put off every life responsibility that I have. \n\nCan I take the thing that I have spent most of my life doing to make a job out of it? Or do I have to never game again and walk into the world at 25 with no life experiences aside from drugs alcohol and video games- all of which I can\u2019t ever partake in again?",

            "selftext": "\n\nI\u2019ve been with my boyfriend for a couple of months now. I know it\u2019s not much, but I really like him. At first we hit it off, the first couple of weeks he put aside his gaming habits and I didn\u2019t know it was this bad. He\u2019s 26.\n\nWe only see each other on the weekends because he works 1,5 hours away. On the weekend he\u2019s closer because his parents live nearby. He still lives with his parents and goes home every weekend, on workdays he lives with a friend of his parents. \n\nOn weekends, which is the only time we see each other, he games all day (about 10 hours a day). Usually making a couple hours of time for me in the evening when he\u2019s really tired. And even then he doesn\u2019t turn his computer off and is ready to game if his friends ask. I\u2019m usually there with him all weekend, in the next room, waiting, minding my own business, until he has the time for me. If we decide to spend a night at my place, he usually rushes home in the morning to game. \n\nHe says that he wants me there with him on the weekend so we can spend as much time together as possible when he has the time, but at the same time he\u2019s told me that he doesn\u2019t like it because he doesn\u2019t want to feel obligated to spend time with me. \n\nI\u2019ve told him how I feel, but that just seems to make it worse. He gets angry and frustrated, telling me I should be thankful for the couple of hours where he finds the time for me. Almost breaking up with me every weekend when I tell him that I wanna spend some quality time together. \n\nI\u2019ve surprised him a couple of times with a home cooked meal, dessert, drinks, candles etc., but I see no effort in return. Today I told him that I really needed to get out of the house sometime soon, maybe go to the beach, the zoo, or just drive around and experience something. But he told me that that\u2019s not how he likes to spend his time and that he didn\u2019t wanna do that. I one time told him to pick something up for dinner on the way home from work because he wanted me to make his favorite meal, and he was so mad at me that night for asking him to do that because he just wanted to go home and relax... I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I\u2019m trying so hard, but I feel like I have to walk on eggshells around him. And every time he\u2019s mad at me he can only see his side of things and blame me for everything, so he almost breaks up with me every time until I give in and I promise to do better.\n\nBut I\u2019m really frustrated. I love him dearly, and he has his moments where he is really caring, and I don\u2019t want to be without him. Help me. Am I being crazy? What should I do?",

I have been thinking about stop playing videogames in order to invest that time in more worthwhile hobbies that force me to interact with people in person. I'm a bit of an introvert and want to change it.\n\nI've always been obsessed with competitive games, I've played everything from SC:BW to CS:GO, always reaching decent ranks like top 20%. I enjoy getting better at games. I thought I should apply this to a real sport or other skill, but there's something about games that really sucks me in: detailed statistics, achievements and profiles.\n\nIt's so superficial, but I recently noticed it. I learnt that just getting good at those games is not exactly what drives me, but rather it is the means by which I obtain the real result I crave: having a cool-looking profile or 'career stats' that would make other players say 'damn, this guy's good'. This is also why I used to smurf a lot.\n\nI always stop playing those games for a few months and then come back right in. I 'm about to finish my undergraduate studies, but lately I keep thinking about starting a new smurf in some game, or keep getting pipedream ideas of getting good enough to be at least a semi-pro level in another. I know it's too much of an investment and not worthwhile, as I should be focusing that time instead in my real job.\n\nAnybody with the same kind of 'triggers'? I've thought of keeping statistics for weightlifting and try to gamify it, but it does not have the same 'oomph' to it.",

            "selftext": "Been playing since 2006, thousands of hours on RS3 and on OSRS. \u201cQuit\u201d on and off, but always came back. Now in my mid 20s with a full time job. \n\nMost recent break from RS was two years ago, relapsed last week. Quit yesterday. Hopefully I mean it, not just take an extended break. \n\nPost relapse thoughts:\n\n1. It\u2019s VERY tempting to tell yourself that you can game in moderation. I\u2019m not saying that people can\u2019t, it\u2019s just the addictive nature of gaming that makes it difficult for many. \n\n2. Only relapsed for five days but it disrupted my sleep schedule which made me a more irritable person. I also ended up playing in the office on OSRS mobile, affecting my productivity.\n\n3. It started off seemingly innocuously: let me check how the game is doing \u2014&gt; I\u2019ll just watch a few YouTube videos \u2014&gt; Alright, I can play but I can keep it in moderation. \n\n4. Common theme in this subreddit but I\u2019ll add it for the sake of diligence: you don\u2019t progress in real life. What am I gaining from chopping virtual trees for hours a day? Nothing. \n\nI deleted the app from my phone, uninstalled the game from my PC and unsubscribed from YouTube content creators. \n\nWhat am I doing now? I want to start learning how to be more proficient in Excel in order to hopefully increase my earning potential and make myself more indispensable in the professional world. Also need to start going to the gym and eating better. \n\nJust had to get this off of my chest. Good luck to everyone looking to quit, currently addicted or fighting temptation!",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone, I hope my story and my personal experience can help some of you out there who are trying to quit gaming.\n\nI [26/m] have been severely depressed since the age of 10, and I have filled every empty and weak moment of my life with unhealthy amounts of video games. For the longest time I could not figure out why I was always so down, why I was always feeling so sad. I had incredibly low self esteem, trouble making or maintain friends, problems attracting the opposite sex, and occasional thoughts of suicide.\n\nI filled so many dark moments of my life with video games. Because for every dark moment, there was a video game that would help me escape reality and I could become something other than my own self. I hated myself.\n\nA few months ago, my depression and anxiety became unbearable. I would occasionally have episodes of mania, which was a wonderful reprieve from depression. My relationship with my girlfriend at the time ended, and I could see nothing positive in her anymore.\n\nThen something changed, I decided to seek counseling and a psychiatrist. I was diagnosed with Bipolar II disorder at the age of 26. Through several months of trying different things, I finally landed on the perfect SSRI. It has quite literally changed everything.\n\n2 days into taking this medication, my obsessive need for video games completely disappeared. Since then, I haven't touched a single video game, not even the countless steam games I've purchased but never actually play. I no longer seek video games for comfort or validation, and honestly, the thought of playing a video game sounds incredibly boring now.\n\nThe lesson here is, please please take care of your mental health. Not all of you may be depressed, but those of you who are, you may be using video games as a crutch to bring you artificial happiness and joy. This is not reality, and you have to do whatever it takes to quit gaming. Once you truly take care of your mental health, you may realise that gaming can be a toxic and self limiting hobby. You don't have to quit gaming. But ask yourself, do you really enjoy gaming for what it is? Or do you use it to escape reality?\n\nI hope this helps some of you out there, feel free to message me if you have any questions.\n\ntl;dr: Take care of yourself and your mental health.Used to be obsessed with gaming, took care of my mental health, quit gaming completely and am back on track to living and loving my life to the fullest.\n\nI wish you all good luck on your journey.",

I have had periods in my life where I have played too much, but those were during my teen years a while back. \n\nRecently I bought a switch but I am considering getting a refund on it and quitting gaming entirely. I enjoy gaming casually and it doesn't massively negatively affect my life, but when I think about what I want to achieve in my life and the kind of person I want to be, gaming seems counterproductive. I could spend that time doing other more productive hobbies instead.\n\nIs it worth just getting the money back and saving it towards things that will benefit my life more?",

            "selftext": "I've read this article and thought it might better help some of you understand themselves, and how to change\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html\n\nTLDR: a habit is formed by a cue/trigger which is followed by a routine and then a reward.\n\nHere's an interesting part of the article:\n\n&gt; The probes in the rats\u2019 heads, however, told a different story. While each animal wandered through the maze, its brain was working furiously. Every time a rat sniffed the air or scratched a wall, the neurosensors inside the animal\u2019s head exploded with activity. As the scientists repeated the experiment, again and again, the rats eventually stopped sniffing corners and making wrong turns and began to zip through the maze with more and more speed. And within their brains, something unexpected occurred: as each rat learned how to complete the maze more quickly, its mental activity decreased. As the path became more and more automatic \u2014 as it became a habit \u2014 the rats started thinking less and less.\n\n&gt; This process, in which the brain converts a sequence of actions into an automatic routine, is called \u201cchunking.\u201d There are dozens, if not hundreds, of behavioral chunks we rely on every day. Some are simple: you automatically put toothpaste on your toothbrush before sticking it in your mouth. Some, like making the kids\u2019 lunch, are a little more complex. Still others are so complicated that it\u2019s remarkable to realize that a habit could have emerged at all.\n\n&gt; Take backing your car out of the driveway. When you first learned to drive, that act required a major dose of concentration, and for good reason: it involves peering into the rearview and side mirrors and checking for obstacles, putting your foot on the brake, moving the gearshift into reverse, removing your foot from the brake, estimating the distance between the garage and the street while keeping the wheels aligned, calculating how images in the mirrors translate into actual distances, all while applying differing amounts of pressure to the gas pedal and brake.\n\n&gt; Now, you perform that series of actions every time you pull into the street without thinking very much. Your brain has chunked large parts of it. Left to its own devices, the brain will try to make almost any repeated behavior into a habit, because habits allow our minds to conserve effort. But conserving mental energy is tricky, because if our brains power down at the wrong moment, we might fail to notice something important, like a child riding her bike down the sidewalk or a speeding car coming down the street. So we\u2019ve devised a clever system to determine when to let a habit take over. It\u2019s something that happens whenever a chunk of behavior starts or ends \u2014 and it helps to explain why habits are so difficult to change once they\u2019re formed, despite our best intentions.\n\nThe article is pretty long, but totally worth it imo.",

I decided it's about time I prioritized my life properly and put away games entirely because I couldn't be happy even with restricted gaming. \n\nI'm dreaming about games and when I'm awake I daydream about games I enjoyed in the past and ideas for games I had. I've been trying to watch more YouTube about animation and writing to help my mind focus on my own creative projects but I find lately I've been really struggling to find any motivation. It's easy to ignore cravings to game, I know I'm just not going to, but that doesn't stop my mind from focusing on the topic even when I try to distract myself.\n\nWhat did you do to be more productive and push gaming out of your mind?",

            "selftext": "Hi everybody, I have known my friends ever since 1st grade. A few weeks ago we graduated college and I'm somewhat concerned about them and their addiction to gaming. Growing up, I always had some kind of gaming console, first it was the Nintendo 64, then it was the xbox, but I stopped playing when I got into highschool so that I could focus on school and on other skills like reading and art. I grew up with gaming and so I think I knew how to handle it responsibly and when to move past it when I had to. My friends are twin brothers and were not allowed to have video games until late in middle school. They were immediately hooked. They were very bright and studious when they were younger but soon they became slackers and nearly everything began to revolve around video games. This continued all through highschool until the present moment after they graduated college. Today I finally got them to come outside with me. It was a beautiful day and we were hiking along a trail beside the Mississippi river and it seems like all they could talk about was video games still. One of them kept telling me to please keep the walk short because he was getting sunburnt and wanted to get back home to play some game on his PC. I hadn't seen them in almost a year and it was really sad that all they could think about was after our time together. I wanted to catch up on life but it seemed that their minds were entirely elsewhere the whole time. When I mention real life things to them I feel like I can see reality rolling off their faces or sometimes they show a look of complete anxiety and detachment. I feel like this addiction has had very real life consequences that become more evident every day. We all have our degrees, but they are struggling to find a job because they never put any heart or real work into their majors. Everything they've ever worked for was just the minimum to buy more time or money for video games. They are incredibly depressed and have no friends and no connections besides one another and myself. I try to get them to hang out but they always make excuses, and even when we do, they are such terrible conversationalists and talk only of what happens when they're staring at screens for 3/4 of their day. Is there any way to break this spell over them or are they lost? Should I give up on this friendship?\n\nMy other friend completely dropped out of college because his smash bros and league of legends addiction. My brother has spent nearly his entire life doing even less than my friends because of largely the same thing, just different games. He is 27. Almost 30. And he has done nothing in life because of weed and video games. I'm kind of amazed that people don't talk about video games more as a social evil. Not because of violence or anything, but because it saps the willpower and potential of so many bright young people. I really hate to sound like an angry disappointed old man, but does anybody else feel like people in our generation are kind of lost? Is there a way to fix it? How do I convince the people I care about to leave their shells and reclaim their lives?",

I\u2019m turning 20 in a month, and the only game I play is brawl stars (about 45 min a day). \n\nWhen I was younger, I played on my gameboy and other consoles. When I hit 6th grade, I discovered wizard101 and I was HOOKED. I loved that game and played until halfway through 9th grade, where I got bored of the game and stopped playing. I remember how every available minute I had I was playing and farming and questing and training and whatnot. Then, I moved on to PC gaming. Built an amazing Alienware machine on my own, and then I was hooked to classic games like Skyrim, CSGO, overwatch, COD games, single player games, you name it. At age 17, I more or less quit pc gaming. I lost interest/got bored and really felt like I was wasting my life away. I took on calisthenics and a few other hobbies like dancing and slowly walked away from gaming. At some point, I got a Mac for school and my old pc was simply sitting collecting dust. So I packed it away and only recently set it up again just for the sake of having a windows pc for either work related stuff and other misc things. \n\nFortnite came out, and my brother who plays Xbox wanted me to play the game with him so I checked it out. I was actually having fun at first, set up binds, but quickly lost interest. \n\nNow here\u2019s what\u2019s new. I don\u2019t really feel the urgency nor pull to play games in general. Like I said, brawl stars is the only game I play now since I have a few friends who play the game with me and we compete against one another. I\u2019m pretty sure if they stopped playing, I\u2019d most probably lose interest in the game. \n\nThe other day, a friend and I had a conversation about our favorite childhood games and Wizard101 was brought up. We were hit with a wave of nostalgia and we unofficially decided to get a one month membership and have some fun. I\u2019ve been contemplating wether to revisit a game that I haven\u2019t played since 2014 just for the memories and nostalgia. \n\nIs it worth it?",

            "selftext": "Ahhhh saturday finally! Burning sensations of Sun rays were trying to wake me up by heating my skin up.. Yep the made me open my eyes. After a good morning stretch I rolled out of bed and fired up my League of Legends client, started the queue so it can find a game while I wash my teeth, piss and drink some water. The grind begins! Just before a game was found, couple of my friends invited me to play, so we had a full party. Couple of games have passed and we just warmed up. When the banter in the voice chat got REAAAAL good my mum decided to intervene with a good old:\"GET OF THAT FUCKING COMPUTER!!! You sit there all damn day and night, Your eyes will fall out! GO OUTSIDE AND MEED SOME FRIENDS!\" That little interception just spiked up the banter in the voice chat. Okay.. It became a meme xD\n\nThere is a huge misconception about gamers that implies how gamers are antisocial, which is completely wrong for the majority. While your peers might build their social circles by attending different activities like playing soccer, basketball, skateboarding, hiking, joining chess or reader clubs, we gamers fulfill our social needs through out online gaming. I remember, before I stopped gaming, having some of the best conversations online, while playing a game. Gamers ARE NOT ANTISOCIAl, they just manifest their social skills virtually. Which has its good and bad sides. On the internet we are pretty much anonymous and can speak our minds easily, knowing that there is no real physical threat to us. Offen in real life socialisation we have a filter which besides filtering all the 'controversial' stuff that could get us in danger (most of the times it wont if we deliver it properly), it also filters our authenticity (which is one of the key points of attractiveness). On the other hand, when we are socialising on the internet nobody can really punch us in the face for something that we say right? So it is a bit easier..\n\nSo after quitting gaming, especially if we've been gaming for many years and haven't had much real life social encounters, there is a big soft skill, which is socialising, that has to be relearned. Imagine if it was RuneScape skill that you had to level up. Just like in any game, to level something up, you need EXPERIENCE. You can pick up new hobbies like rock climbing, martial arts, skateboarding those are a few of countless activities that are great for meeting new people. Let's say you are already going to the gym so you want something more cognitively stimulating. Learning a new language is a great way to meed new people, attending different events or meetups, learning improv etc. NGO sector is great for networking and an amazing playground for improving your social skills because you are constantly meeting new people on various projects and also you can learn a lot if interesting stuff, help the community and travel a lot most of the times for free. For our male population I'd also highly recommend getting into pick-up and learning GAME. Why this is interesting for me is because you are meeting new people but off 'cold approach' which means that you are basically going up to strangers and introducing yourself, with no common interests, activities or people that you share beforehand. Game is also an amazing anxiety killer and confidence booster. \n\nAnyways my point was that quitting gaming leaves some empty spots YOU HAVE TO fill out in order to quit successfully and one of them is your social circle. Good mindset advice I can give you is that socialising is a SKILL and it CAN BE LEARNT! Majority of people, when they see someone with high social status or someone charismatic, say oh he is a natural or he's born with it, which is COMPLETELY WRONG. Social skills and attraction can be learned, its just about putting in the work, leveling it up and TAKING CONSISTENT ACTION. I'm glad I helped you. Cheers and keep your head up!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S. If you have any question or are looking for advice, encouragement, or my insight on quitting gaming feel free to message me or post in the comment section, I'll be more than glad to help.",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone, I just found this sub this morning after looking for \"video game addiction\" on Reddit. I live in France and Thursday was a national day off, and we usually take Friday as a day off aswell. So I had a 4 day-long week-end, and it was the perfect opportunity for me to catch up on my school projects (engineering school) and clean the appartement, apply for interships, etc.\n\nNow we planned with friends to set up a Minecraft server as we've been doing so for the past two years for the summer holidays. Needless to say, I spent Wednesday night playing MC, Thrusday from 2pm to 2am, and so on Friday and yesterday... with League breaks, as I am (was ? ;) ) climbing my way up to Platinum rank. \n\nI lied to my mom. I told her I worked on my projects  Friday, bu I didn't. I tried to stop playing, only to go take a shower and go back to MC as my friends were online on discord.   \n\n\nNow last Night I couldn't restrain myself from playing pointless ARAM games, that don't even give you ranks (I lost all of them on top of that). I went to bed at 2 am, couldn't sleep for an hour due to post-gaming eye strain and brain activity, and stress and guilt because I knew I'd have to accomplish all the work in just one day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo here I am, on r/StopGaming, and glad to have my 1st hour without games. I feel excited and motivated, Cam's videos are relatable because he used to be a gamer like me, but I'm also frightened by the upcoming week / month, as I've never succeeded in stopping games. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for being here, I'm looking forward to start getting into drawing, martial arts, writing and reading in the future. Now time to work baby, these project reports are not going to write themselves.",

I don't have a degree, or many skills that can make me a lot of money. Granted, being a valet pays well enough so I can afford to take care of myself, but it's unfulfilling and I feel I have lost sight of my dreams and desires.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI decided to stop playing because video games were becoming my only source of pleasure and happiness. I was trying to fulfill deeper desires of accomplishment, competitiveness and progression and even social interactions through gaming.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI realized I was using video games to escape my life. I'm learning to trust my intuition more when it's comes to letting go of certain behaviors and what I should focus on instead.

Often I find myself bored and idle, and in order to multitask and pass away the time I find myself opening up a casual game app on my phone or iPad concurrently while watching some show, video or movie. The longest has been something over 3 to 6 months, but the time was blurry between when I was a single and struggling student and soon a newlywed and C section mom within less than 1 year's time. The only thing I could do to quell my anxiety was turn to the games whenever I could spare a free moment, which when you're unemployed, is often. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI delete the games off my devices a few days ago. It's when I found myself nonchalantly \"helping\" my mom with a game level on her phone earlier that I realized, this is a \"cheat.\" So, officially today is day zero.

I like playing games, I play games with my girlfriend and friends, but that's about the only enjoyment I get from it, or the obvious like playing ranked and working towards ranking up. But I've found that with almost everygame, getting to a certain rank is just a grind and doesn't actually require a ton of skill so it's becoming less and less rewarding (after actually noticing this). So I'm trying to find other games that have good replay-ability without being ultra competitive or even competitive at all. I don't even mind the grind of games, it's grinding and competitiveness mixed that just puts me off. Then losing becomes frustrating etc. So yea, I'm actually looking for some suggestions for games that can be replayed, have good co-op, but aren't competitive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks",

I grew up playing halo, command and conquer generals, and a bunch of other fun games including the half lifes, counterstrike, the original maddens, Mario 64, etc.\n\nGaming companies used to have to make quality games to make a profit.  Nowadays they are focused on milking gamers for all they\u2019re worth via micro transactions or marketing a shit product to sale at $59.99 - Fallout 5 I\u2019m looking at you.\n\nI was smart enough to see this shit coming though and haven\u2019t bought a game new since probably 2008. Partially it was money wise but the pst years it\u2019s because I\u2019ve seen what video games were becoming and I knew better than to give these half-assers my money.\n\nTo be honest, my biggest reason why o might stop gaming or literally just play the old games like mega man, command and conquer, etc. is because I\u2019m sick of the online community in games and I\u2019m sick of the polished turds that games have become.  It\u2019s awful.\n\nHas EA NHL gotten a rating higher than 2 stars in the past 4 years? It\u2019s outrageous how these companies have monopolies on the rights of certain franchises and they just turn out shit.\n\nIt\u2019s sad because I feel like gaming peaked in the era of modern warfare 2 and it\u2019s been downhill since. I try to give new games a chance and I\u2019m always disappointed. There\u2019s maybe a handful of good games I would say per year now on consoles. PC it might be better.\n\nAnyway, I found this sub by searching \u201cmodern games suck\u201d and figured I would give me two cents. It\u2019s odd because I\u2019ve always been an athlete and never had the issue of losing my life to gaming. Gaming was like a reward honestly. Something that inspired me and was a fun experience.

            "selftext": "Hey there!\n\nThis isn't easy for me to admit, but it's been a long time coming and I think I'm finally ready to face my video game addiction.  \nClues have been piling up for a long time. I spend a lot less time with friends, I do a lot less stuff for university and I started caring less and less about what I eat and how dirty my apartment has become.  \nI had somewhat of an epiphany today. Spent today and yesterday with my family. I don't really see that often anymore ever since I moved away from my home town. It was nice meeting them again, but at the same time I felt bummed out and kind of restless the whole time. Took me a while to realize that I was looking forward to getting back to my laptop. I'm just sitting there while my sister talks about her new relationship and exciting stuff going on in her life and all I could think about were different starcraft strategies. Caught myself not paying attention at all. I bet she noticed, too. I felt like a huge asshole. And still I couldn't help wishing I could just play a quick match after dinner.  \nAlso talked to my grandparents afterwards. They're both quite successful in their line of work, and they absolutely love what they do. Even after their retirement, they are still filled with so much passion for their work, it's inspiring. It reminded me of how I felt about my field of studies, before video games took up most of my free time.  I want to get back to that point. I don't want video games to be all I ever think about. I want to feel stimulated by learning new stuff. I want to be passionate about the things I do. I want to actually genuinly care about the people in my life. I want to care about myself.\n\nOn the ride back to my place I had a lot of time to think this whole thing through. The second I got home I uninstalled every single game on my computer.\n\nThis is where I want to draw the line. Day #1 without video games.",

            "selftext": "So here\u2019s the deal: I used to play games a lot. I realized I didn\u2019t enjoy it, so I cut back. Something I also realized is that what I really enjoy is the atmosphere of gaming. I don\u2019t enjoy playing a game by myself (except for VR because the technology genuinely impresses me) so my main driving force to play is when friends are online. If no ones online, I either won\u2019t play, or I\u2019ll play and get off in 15 minutes. \n\nNow in an ideal world i could live by a schedule. \u201cSuch and such friend will be on at 3:00. Ok, I can happily do the things I want to do or need to do before then.\u201d No checking discord to see if people are on, nothing like that. I would feel at peace if it worked like that. But it doesn\u2019t. People get online sporadically and it\u2019s annoying because I don\u2019t want to keep checking to see if people are on. \n\nThis makes it hard for me to focus and do something I want to do: read. I have a lot of books I want to read but the impulse to constantly check discord to see if people are on makes it difficult for me to stick with it. If only I had a set time when I knew people would be on, I\u2019d be able to read longer and without distraction",

The addiction is real, the chemicals involved are real &amp; personally, I found gaming to numb emotional &amp; even physical pain, especially when the adrenaline hit. Gaming has defined much of my life, and my parents had exposed me to it when I was as only 3, which is the age I started playing Counter-Strike 1.6 and Diablo II. I'm underweight for my age (18.5 BMI) because I constantly find myself skipping meals to play all day.  \n\n\nI have no driver's licence, no job, no qualification and am that stereotypical virgin male who lives with their single mother (recently diagnosed with terminal cancer). My life as a gamer has been miserable and limiting to say the least, yesterday I decided to turn that all around. I've uninstalled all my games, gaming platform &amp; even discord (to distance myself away from those friends who tempt to you to play). So far, I already feel happier. My mind is free in a sense, thinking of all the possibilities which life has to offer rather than only thinking about PTR changes. I know things won't be easy out there in the real world for someone who's had the luxury of comfort their entire lives, but I have no choice either way.   \n\n\nIs this something I wish I had done earlier? No. I would've gone straight back to gaming anyway. But certain life circumstances have really forced new outlooks for me onto life, hence why it'll be different this time.",

            "selftext": "Hey, first time posting here. Just need to rant and get things off my chest to whomever out there that is willing to listen. So don't expect this to be worded amazingly.   \n\n\nI'm currently turning 24 and I've gamed all my life basically. It didn't really kick off until i got my first gameboy when I was 6. And I loved it! It was always real fun laughing and playing with my brother during the GBA and DS period and playing a few games here and there on the ps2 together. When I got my first PC at 10, I only played a few games on that to be clear. School had always come first and I loved school. I get into High-School and I'm now in the ps3/360/3ds era of gaming and while I played games quite often during high-school, my study always came first. All study and assignments would be out of the way and then I would game for a few hours until bed. I learnt to play guitar, write really well and I was highly social during high school among other things. Never saw gaming as a problem. I'd only really play some single player games and finish them and that'd be the end of it. Perhaps some multiplayer games here and there online. Immediately after finishing HS I went into University to pursue my dreams of becoming a teacher and to formally recognize my skill in language from all the time I put in personally on my own over 5 years. I was forced to defer a few months in. My life spiraled down.  \n\n\nNow flash forward 7 years after things went downhill. 7 years of time has gone by and I have absolutely nothing to show for it. The whole time I've basically just been gaming to escape from the reality of my life. Partial fault falls on me for not doing anything to get out of this gaming mess. It really went downhill after i graduated. I suffer from really bad depression and have been living with it for almost 12 years now and it gets in the way of a lot of things despite me fronting as being fine. I have no friends aside from one person i talk a few words with maybe once a week, aside from that I'm horribly alone. Haven't used my brain in years because I don't see a point due to all the events that had occurred around me and my mental health getting in the way. Gaming went from something that I found really fun, to playing for 16+ hours a day (everyday I could) to talk to other people about it so I would feel somewhat included and have worth. Which I didn't recognize at the time.  \n\n\nTwo months ago it was like I hit a brick wall and woke up. I remember saying like what the hell are you doing dude? All this time and effort into games that I don't even have pleasure playing anymore. I'm just mindlessly grinding for the sake of it to give myself some sort of feeling of accomplishment.  It was when I tried to stop did I realize i have a problem. At first, i just stopped playing that game. But i went onto another one. When i realized that, i tried to just playing once or twice a day for a few hours at most. But then i find myself just surfing the internet looking at gaming related nothing to stimulate myself or watching crap. So I decided to replace gaming with self improvement. And hey! The first month was great. But my mental health kicks back in and I just don't see the point and i fell back into gaming. Some familiar ground to lose myself in so i don't have to think about how bad my life is.  \n\n\nThe problem is...I want to change. I know I have this intelligent brain, I know I was good at what i used to do. And I know that I should be continuing to exercise and be more productive (I'm only 5kg overweight but I view myself as so much larger and are self conscious over it for no reason)... but i cant stop receding back into playing games to escape. I want to stop, but at the same time I don't. I always enjoy playing pokemon each year for a little bit each day and the same with a variety of other nintendo games but its these huge rpgs and mmorpgs that I know I should stop but cant. I'm wasting my life. 7 years gone when I could have been a teacher by now, mastered guitar further than what i am and overall be a lot happier doing what i love. But I don't understand why I can't just get up and do it and end up going back to playing games :( I'm really lost. Having nobody to word this to doesn't help and knowing I'm much better than this is even worse. Why do I know what will make me happier and still choose not to do it?   \n\n\nI've lost my identity. I haven't been out of the house to socialize in years. Why would anyone want to talk to a nobody about academic things when they already have their own friends? I'm all for going back to finish my degree, but I'm not as good at writing as i was back then. I don't want to fail. All these pressures I'm only putting on myself and I still (knowing its bad) go back to playing games that I'm not getting any pleasure out of even though there's games i do find pleasure in. But i don't play those for some reason. This addiction I've put on myself has taken over my life. I just want out :( I just want to be who I used to be.",

            "selftext": "For me, playing was almost never about the game itself but the endgame, the wins, the high level achievements. My first game I was addicted to was Runescape, I liked it for what it was...at first. Then after a year or two of playing I was only focused on being a good PKer. I was 14 at the time and I didn't enjoy skilling or anything like that. I would only PK. Less than 5% of the game I'd say. I wouldn't even enjoy the fights, I would only enjoy it if I got the kill. That's it. I'd play for 20+ minutes for ONE kill worth of like 30 seconds of pleasure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy next game was WoW, same thing. The leveling, the grind, the story, the bosses? Nah. Take me to the Arena. Again it was PvP that kept me playing, that 30 seconds of pure bliss when you'd win an intense game of Arena. At first I loved the thrill of just playing, but near the end I would just enjoy seeing my MMR go up and the victory. The losses? Boring. The few times where I'd do something besides PvP? Boring. Anything but that 30 seconds was boring. So I quit after two years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen came League. It took me a looong time to come to terms with the fact that I didn't really enjoy League. I was tricked into thinking I loved playing the game but I didn't. I enjoyed laning because I could outplay my opponent, or I could get kills, or secure a dragon or Baron. It gives you tiny wins sprinkled throughout the shit to keep you coming back. The last three years I've played, If I don't get the win the entire game was worthless. I'm not even having fun for the tiny wins anymore. If I'm losing it's even worse than winning. I'm desensitized to hell from the game. I've played for nearing on 8 years and I literally just play because I'm slightly less bored when playing than not playing, my days feel shorter, and I can get away from my problems and not actually do anything to solve them. Even as I type this I want to play, knowing that at the end of the session I'll be tired and disappointed. This is my I don't even know the number at this point attempt, I want to make it stick this time.",

            "selftext": "I have quit gaming entirely for almost two years now. I haven't watched a game or read about games in that time, I've deleted everything to do with games from my HDD, and sold my old gaming mouse, I haven't even visited this sub since the first few months of me quitting. \n\nI used to play lots of CSGO and Overwatch, and when I quit I had vivid dreams of me playing them during the first few weeks, which I figured was a normal part of withdrawal. But what I am struggling with now is that I am still dreaming of playing CSGO a few times a month. A couple of nights ago I had a stupidly realistic dream that was like a whole game of CSGO (pistol round, calling out places on the map, defusing, randoms on voice chat etc.) and it's pissing me off because I don't want to still be having these dreams that feel like a relapse when I wake up. I don't want these stupid games taking up any space in my brain. I thought they would of stopped by now, but it's like this game is seared into my brain. \n\nSo my question is for the people a few more years down the line than me, do the dreams ever stop? And is there a way that I can make them stop?",

Gaming was my escape, my purpose and social life.. it was everything to me. I figured it was soooo toxic and destructive so I decided to quit it. And I made it!!! I went through 90 day detox and not I have built enough self discipline to game casually and not get addicted again.\n\nAfter looking back at my life I am really proud how I've changed and now I want to project that to other people. Now I'm on a mission. My main goal is to help current game addicts overcome the challenges of quitting because I fucking know the amazingness of REAL life and the fulfillment, accomplishment and confidence that facing life eye to eye brings you.\n\nI would be really grateful If you guys would share with me your stories! Feel free to tell me your struggles, what keeps you up at night and why you keep coming back to games. What are your 3 biggest problems when trying to quit? If it is uncomfortable for you to discuss that in the comment section you can write a direct message to me and I'll be more than happy to respond!\n\nCheers good people and keep your head up!",

            "selftext": "Where to start.. \n\nFirst of all, I almost forgot that this sub even existed. It was two days ago that I sat down with my dad to talk about some generic topics and family stuff, when we decided to touch up on technology and hardware in general, thus leading us to the topic of PCs and gaming.. One sentence, led by another, we started talking about my past experiences with gaming and where it brought me today ( I'm 24 and I've been gaming since a very young age. ) My parents were generally strict while I was growing up, but gaming is something they let me have, among other things such as trying out sports, dance etc.. Though, due to my surroundings and friends that liked to game, I stuck to that and gave up on most other activities. \n\nUntil late middle school, I tended to play during most of my free time and gave little to no thought about my future, what I wanted to do or where I saw myself in a few years. Fast forward to University, I had a lot more to work towards, but gaming was still something that was on my mind. Mind you, even if I wasn't gaming as hardcore as some people, I tended to spend the big majority of my free time (4-5h) a day playing video games, thinking about  nothing but my academic obligations and when to eat. \n\nAnyways.. back to me finishing University.. I started to think about what I wanna do in life and figured out that most of my \"skills\" oriented around gaming.. I had very low social skills, anxiety and in general.. I was very analytical and hyper-rational. I had no idea where to begin and I felt like I was miles behind my peers and even people younger than me.. I was lost in life, picked the wrong academic path and didn't have many friends. It was a huge slap towards my self-esteem and a somewhat of a wake up call. But slowly and surely, I decided to make a small change, day by day, month by month. \n\nIt started with me going to the gym (mind you for a month, then not going two months, then going again..) It sucked.. I couldn't make a habit stick but I was persistent enough to make a change.. Slowly, as time passed and I got some confidence back, I started going out with new people (usually friends of my friends) and started working on my social skills.. I would lie if I told you that everything went great.. It didn't.. I was bad at it.. I had no interest in small talk, couldn't get into general everyday topics and didn't have enough experience to talk about events and happenings. I started questioning myself even more and the anxiety just kept coming back. I tried reminding myself that it's better to start now than never.. \n\nBut with me being less anxious about (still am) life. I decided to pick up dancing again due to my friend inviting me to a summer dance camp oriented at tango.. He mentioned that the camp had some nice sight-seeing, mountaineering and food! I gave it a go and it was the best decision of my life. I met tons of people, made friends, connected with like-minded people and started getting better at talking with friends and strangers.. When we got back, I picked up tango and a few other things such as rock-climbing and photography.. Mind you I'm still a beginner at the last two that I mentioned.. It also took a long time for my brain to realize that you can't master everything in a few months and that persistence and dedication is something that, on the long-term, will bring you happiness. Besides the new hobbies, I had my first relationships, heartbreaks, love, hate. I had to go through what most people go at a younger age much later.. It was tough.. Like I was hit with a brick.. I questioned myself some more.. Had emotional withdrawals.. Got passed them, then got them again.. I was depressed, but also happy that I was making all these changes.. \n\nMy point being... Life is hard.. It's shit.. It's the toughest game that you will ever play. Some people play it better than others. But, should you give up on the person you see yourself becoming just because it's a steep climb? Probably not. It took me a long time to realize this.. Hopefully it will take you less time than it did to me.. But even if you are older than me.. That's ok.. You shouldn't be angry or sad about that.. Anyone should be proud of having enough courage to make a change. Now... I could have talked a lot more about this topic, but it would probably take a lot more pages.. This is kind of a... TL;DR I guess. haha \n\nTo end all of this with a quote that resonated quite a lot with me: \"The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, the second best time is now.\"",

            "selftext": "So this is my second draft as I feel I got a bit too all over the place the first time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI contacted the creators of League today, Riot Games, and requested that all of my League of Legends accounts be deactivated. I'm 22 years old, I have no job currently, and Summer quarter for school doesn't start for another month. I've had a pretty fierce gaming addiction for the better part of I'd say 8 years or so. It's gotten so bad at times that I didn't even graduate high school due to the fact that I couldn't be bothered to show up to class or do homework. I'd much rather be playing video games. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd say if you take League of Legends out of the mix my addiction to gaming is less of a \"Oh shit my life is in ruins\" and more of a \"Okay, this guy plays a lot of video games.\" and I have no desire to stop playing video games, maybe just get a bit more control over it. I feel like saying goodbye to League was a big step in the right direction. League was always that game that I filled time with. It's just so easy to get into a game and forget about life for 15-50 minutes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNon-multiplayer/non-competitive games don't really do this for me anymore. I used to LOVE single player games when I was younger. I could get lost for hours playing Oblivion, Fallout 3, and many more. I think League really desensitized me to these sort of games. I don't know how it happened but my theory is that League is such a high intensity game that my brain can't handle not having constant stimulus from more story driven games. It's so frustrating because I don't really know how to explain it... I almost feel anxious when playing games that aren't League. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently tackled this problem by getting a PS4 and buying games such as Fallout 4. I will say it's been really refreshing actually. My goal was to distance myself from League and it actually did a good job at that. I know you may be thinking \"You just replaced one game addiction with another one\" but I actually find that when I play these games my gaming sessions are much shorter. Probably because I do eventually get bored and want to do something else. The problem for me was that the \"something else\" was League. I felt like if I distanced myself away from PC gaming I would have an easier time and honestly it's seemed to work. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I want to do now is become even more \"normally adjusted\". The problem I have is that since I've been so addicted to constant stimulus that I dropped all my old hobbies such as reading, soccer, hanging out with friends, etc. and now that I've taken League out of the picture I almost feel as if I've lost a large part of my identity. Some people go to work or school, have a few drinks with the lads, go home and take care of some chores, work out, read a book, meditate, or whatever it may be. For me it was go to school/work, come home and try to play a game that's not League until I get bored and eventually default to League again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI no longer feel satisfied when I spend day after day gaming anymore. I think what sparked this was having my free time restricted by things like work, school, or relationships with woman. I found that once I started to fill my life with other things gaming became more appealing. Too much of one thing is never good, ay?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went ahead and ordered two books I was interested in and set up a bunch of alerts on my phone to help structure my day a bit better. I still have way too much time though until school starts. What did you guys do when you stopped gaming? I've spent so many years ignoring all the wonderful things in the world that I feel so lost and almost scared to step out into the real world again. I've always been great at socializing when I finally put myself in the situation to do so but I've always had a really hard time getting myself to leave the house. Especially since I no longer have any friends I hang out with. It's hard for me to even fathom what people do that don't play video games. It's so easy to spend hours upon hours playing games. What activities/hobbies can possibly fill the amount of time that gaming can? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHopefully this draft was a bit easier to read. I'm finding it sort of hard to summarize 8 years of addiction. Any and all help is greatly appreciated.",

I was wondering if i should hide my consoles in my closet or sell them to GameStop out right.  Also what are the general thoughts as to reading video game news?  I am going to restrict twitch for sure, but I'm worried that with E3 coming up, I will want to see all the latest trailers to upcoming games.  Do you guys listen to gaming podcasts? should i restrict myself from listening to these?  This goes back to my question of selling vs  hiding the consoles.  Will i be able to moderate after the 90 day detox?  I would love to keep my switch for the Zelda game coming later this year.  Any advice would be great.  Thanks everyone!",

            "selftext": "Hey dear friends, I\u00b4ve played games since being a little one only 6-7 years of age. Went through a lot of good games like stronghold, morrowind, etc but eventually got hooked on LoL (as so many). I spent all my teenage years playing until graduation and after I went travelling long periods of time 2x1,5 years. Funny enough during these periods I barely if at all touched games but as soon as I come home I drift back into the grind playing several hours daily.. with this time being the 2nd time of falling back into these old patterns forgetting all the goals I\u00b4ve set myself all the things I wanted to do when Im back and just wasting away but this time I called quits.\n\nI realize that especially multiplayer games like LoL, Dota, Fortnite fuck with your brain and reward center so much its really difficult to get off it.. every session is different, always trying something, new hoping for some sick outplays, getting frustrated,etc. There is so much action, competetiveness, emotion, adrenaline, dopamine tied to sitting still and staring into a bunch of LED\u00b4s. A big portion of real life doesnt have so many stimuli and can be rather quiet and you have to deal with thoughts and boredom but games are an easy escape... keep you busy,entertained and youre not \"there\". It seems like many things are so mundane and bland that you\u00b4d rather keep playing. Looking at the screen thinking of what to do \"ah what the heck one more round\". Hobbys and relationsships suffer and youre mental state gets worse too everyday fighting against the urge to play and work towards goals. You say to yourself \"tomorrow only 3 games\" \"tomorrow I only play in the evening\" \"I only play as long as I feel like im having fun\". Meanwhile youve installed and uninstalled the game a couple times, tried to give the account to a friend only to ask to have it back a couple days later. It requires tremendous willpower to say: I quit this is it. \n\nAnother form of games namely MMOs, RPGs and sorts also hugely play into escapism where you can be the hero and live your fantasy dreams, you can be someone, you can see amazing worlds but in the end youre just stuck behind a screen not seeing the real marvelous world our earth and not working on any real life skills. \n\nAnyways enough of that I also wanna talk about what I think might help getting off games and how to deal with the time after. \n\nI think its important to keep busy and if you have to scrap the bottom of the barrel find something to do call up some friends, read a book, make plans for the upcoming day/week, find things you wanna learn and hobbys you wanna get into, set yourself some goals. Its hard to fill a void like that after years of habitual gaming so everyday requires dedication to not fall back into it but it will only get easier with time you just gotta break the routine.\n\nDont know  where Im going with this anymore..probably some thing I forgot to mention or wrote a bit wack but maybe someone can get something out of this so Ill just post it. \n\nPeace",

I apologized for my bad english and bad sorting in conversation\n\n   So I been gaming since i was 10.I started gaming with my brother in online game called C21. mostly we play only online games cause it's free and we don't have to use our parents money\n\n   When i enter an pre-engineering school i feel underpressured all the time i feel like i have to challenging all the time and cause of that i feel a hatred toward my classmate and i think i got depression and anxiety \n\n   Recently i feel unmotivated to play game but i still play it because it will be waste to my money that my parents work hard for sometimes it even cause a headache for me.I think that i might be bored of PC games so i considered buying nintendo switch about two weeks ago  (in my elementary school my friends got gameboy colors  and i borrow him play and it was amazing) i didn't think about which game i'm getting and i just buy botw since everyone so hype back then and now i'm 40 hours on botw and i feel like i feel it worth my money so i think i would get more games.\n\n  But then i thought.All this time am i having a great time? or i just keep grinding on the things that died off me many years ago and i still missed them?\n\ntoday im 18 yo and i feel a little bit depressed i not considered to go see a doctor or something like that in my country we considered depression as  a inexistance things they say all tbe things is up to your heart and you will be fine\n\ni tried to talking to my mom many times as i can't count but i can't really speak what's my mind is now just like this post \n\nI'm really sorry for bad grammar and confusing words\nbut i feel hopeless now and i don't see any exit",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone - I am so inspired by the posts on this board.\n\nI've played World of Warcraft every day - even on family vacations - for something like 5 years. Even when expansions grew stale, I checked in and found something to grind. Why? Because I really like my guild!  Like when long-time guild members left for whatever reason, I actually felt sad and mourned a little. We'd had exciting and hilarious adventures together in Azeroth, after all - friendships felt so tight although really, I don't know these folks much beyond the game.\n\n  \nThis is Day 8 for me not logging on.  I've uninstalled the game and last night, got rid of Discord. It is time to get out there and make real new friends (not sure how yet but I will figure it out) and find real life adventures. I am hitting the gym more than before and eating healthy and sleeping SO MUCH better (earlier and with less wind-down time needed).  I just feel a little lonely...\n\n  \nAnyone else feel like that ever?  What did you do? (I'm not in school now and work people are great but not for hanging out; most have families and responsibilities after work).\n\n Thank you!",

            "selftext": "So, just a quick review. Well I played starting in 2016 after I had a bit of a break down and alienated most of my friends. I had a lot going for myself, even hung out with really pretty women. But you know shit hit the fan hard and I started to hide in League of legends. I developed this very unhealthy relationship with the game and it's community. This game evoked so many emotions in my, I can understand why so many people make a big deal out of it. It even cost me 1 uni semester. Now I'm working on making up for it. It's been 6 months since my last game and I can honestly say my life has improved, at least now I have order. I study now 8 hours per day and play 1-2 hours on my mobile phone. It helped replacing LoL with Arena of Valor (a mobile MOBA). Now there are rumours that LoL will come to mobile (Fuck you Riot Games), but I will ignore that game. So yeah, do yourself a favour and stay away from this game. I've seen many students throw their life away over this unhealthy shit. I hate these people on r/leagueoflegends who claim their life is perfectly fine while still playing 4+ hours a day, fools! This game is cance and I'm glad I cut it out. It took me many attempts though, I re-installed it like 30 times at least. But now well, if you keep at it you can get away from it. Just remember that his game is holding back your progress in life.",

            "selftext": "Yesterday I decided to quit playing video games.\nI've been playing league of legends for over 9 years. And accumulated over 250 days of playing without a break. \nIf I had spent 1/10th of the time on thing It would be 400 days of 1.5h activity that I like. I'd be an expert.\nWhy?\nWhen I was young I read about 1 book in 2 weeks. I couldn't stop reading, but then I bought my first pc from my savings when I was like 10-11.  I spent less and less time on reading and after about a year I just stopped, I wanted but I always had an excuse.\nSometimes I pulled an all-nighter like every games does, and didn't care about my hygiene.\nMy grades fell from one of the best in class to one of the worst.\nI'm speaking like an animal cussing every second word, I don't even notice that I cussed, it's like a breathing.  \nI even stopped going to the gym, the thing I loved.\nI could go on and on.\n\nI read on this sub to quit it for 3 months, if u still want to play just do it if u don't. Just don't, but don't play video games for 3 mothis.\n\nIf I didn't sold my monitor to my brother yesterday I would have played this morning, it's so strong, when I'm writing this post I'm literally shaking because I want to play. But something tells me it'll be better, that it has to be that way.\n\nI have a shit ton of things I want like I want to perfect my English although I think I'm fairly fluent in it, I want to learn Japanese, socialize more with people. I want a lot and in order to do that I have to quit gaming. Someday I want to move out from Poland to Japan and live there, it's my dream.\n\nMy family, friends don't believe in me, they think I'm be too weak for that, and they may be right.\n\nTo be honest, I don't believe in that and I know I'm capable of doing great things, I just need to take this one step.\n\nI'd love some support from anybody. I had to write this publicly to encourage myself.",

Problem is that reinstalling steam was such an easy thing to do. For the next 2 years, I was on a loop of uninstalling steam, waiting a few weeks, then reinstalling it for 1 week. \n\nThis was problematic. Thankfully, you can request steam to permanently delete your account and all your associated games. You will have 30 days to change your mind and stop the process. \n\nThis is a good way to help you stop. I just lost more than $2k in games. This is a pretty good incentive to not reinstall steam since I know have to buy all the games I would want back.",

I came to the point that **I know that is bad** and that I know I should simply quit it but... for some reason in my mind it doesn't feel so natural to me.\n\nIf it was any other game I think I could stop normally but with this one there is a *catch* that disturbs me: the gaming group I want to leave is the group I created. To make it worse, an entire gaming community was built around this group and the ideas and the game aspects I created and all that were supported by others and eventually brought to the game itself. I tried to limit the time I spend with it but I always end up going back anyways because I simply can't let go.\n\nI feel like I have strings attached to me and the group. I've been playing with them for too long and every time I'm about to leave I end up just taking an **absence period**, implying that I always return and I always... do.\n\nI've put things in perspective: my studies, my social life, my family, it is all being affected by the game and I know it needs to stop! But I keep having this internal struggle to leave it and never look at it again. It's crazy that I'm aware that this game has absolutely no truthful value to my life and it is actually damaging it **and still** I ignore it and go back to play the damn game.\n\nI **need** to leave it... but I'm too addicted.  \nAny suggestions to bring this fallen gamer to his sense are more than welcome...\n\nThanks for reading.",

I have friends, but none of us are close because I'm not interested in things they're interested in (aka i really only care about gaming right now), I get nervous around people mainly because I have no clue how to talk to people. If I quit gaming, what are some things I could replace it with, and also how do I enjoy these activities?

            "selftext": "Before I start, yes, this is a throwaway account because I am sort of known in the gaming community (not a streamer/pro), and I don't really want people in my life to know how much this addiction has affected me. So the game I played is League of Legends for about 7 years now. I am a high rank in this game (always diamond/master+, this season even challenger). I have played this game for 5+ hours every day for the last 3-4 years. In the beginning I wanted to become a pro, and later maybe I continued to play it because it was really the only thing/skill that I was really good at compared to others. However I was thinking to myself recently and I really only now realized that I am seriously addicted. I don't have any other hobbies. I don't hang out with friends. I barely talk to my family in the day. I don't leave my room. I think I may be depressed and playing league was/is a way for me to cope with it. But I have gained a lot of weight, my grades in college are slacking, and I just don't even enjoy league of legends because of its toxic community now. I believe I had signs of addiction from even 2016 when I went out of the country for a month and would constantly watch twitch on my phone or try to setup league there even on a computer that couldn't run it (bad server too). I have uninstalled the game and reinstalled many times and recently it has gotten really bad because in the last 4 days, I would play in the day, uninstall at night, and reinstall the next morning and do the same thing again. (13 uninstall/re installs in last 2 months). The people in my life don't understand that video game addiction is real, and I discovered this subreddit today so I decided to share. Today is the day I am planning on just quitting this game for good and discover other hobbies, work on getting fit again, making plans with old friends that I have lost touch with, getting a job, and many more goals I want to work on. I also used to play on my university team so I was thinking on what to do when it comes time to try out for the league team, or if friends invite me to play on LAN tournament with them, or watch their streams. Also can I watch LCS? Should I just completely remove this game from my life for forever/ or until i have accomplished some goals then I can play only a little bit? So many questions I have that bother me. Any advice or comments that could help me be successful in this is appreciated. Sorry for the long post and thanks for reading this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Too addicted to league and finally decided to seriously quit today. Would appreciate any advice.",

            "selftext": "I'm just gonna start out by saying quitting gaming is not my goal. My goal is to reduce the time I spend gaming (play in moderation) and get more satisfaction from playing less. I think this is very much possible as I know a lot of people in my life that are able to lead balanced, productive lives while still gaming. So far I think I've actually found some success with this goal from changing some of my expectations/perspectives. \n\nSome of this might pertain to the specific genres of games I tend to play, but I'm sure there are other similar perspectives others might have developed that I'm really interested in hearing about. Some of what I'm about to say is copy pasted from one of my earlier comments, so just a heads up. \n\nI tend to play MMO's, not exclusively, but mostly. A little LoL moba on the side. They have the reputation of being very time consuming. And they definitely can be depending on how you play them. I've found that changing my perspectives and expectations has me playing less and feeling more fulfilled with the time I play.\n\nFor instance in the past I used to feel pressure to have the best gear, and do absurd amounts of grind to obtain it. Only to end up having to replace it and restart the cycle several months later... But since then I've come to realize that one doesn't need the best gear to play 99% of content in games. Skill goes a lot further and is transferable to other games. For PC games that means learning things like keybinding, mouse turning, rotations, etc is a much better time investment than having the best gear. And you'll often outperform those people with the best gear, with your average, easily obtainable gear.\n\nI'm also no longer opposed to spending a little bit of money to support games I like to play (so long as they don't use push really scummy sales tactics or p2w). I used to feel proud about penny pinching in games that gave you the option to do ridiculous grind instead of paying money for stuff. That might have made sense when I was a lot younger and didn't have much money, but had a lot of time. But now that I'm older and working, why would I spend tens or hundreds of hours to save maybe several dollars worth of something, when I can make that much money in under 1 hour at work. My former mindset was just stupid.\n\nIn games nowadays I also very early on try to understand the Auction House, player trading medium that goes by different names depending on the game. By learning what items have value and researching what is obtainable in game for the least amount of time investment, I'm able to make tons of in game currency easily these days selling those items, instead of grinding activities that gave little return on time investment. \n\nIn mobas like League which I've played much less, I used to feel pressure to be a higher rank (I was a bronze scrub). And I felt bad about my standing and how difficult it was for me to climb despite my best efforts to learn and improve. I just realized I was being too hard on myself by comparing myself with the top players, or even some of my friends who were higher ranks. As all these players (my friends) had invested significantly more time in playing the game, many playing for years. Was it fair for me to expect to reach their level of skill in just a matter of months? Same with a lot of the Youtube pros. A lot of them had been playing since or shortly after launch. Some also had experience playing other mobas even before League came out. So it's only natural that given their time investment and amount of practice, they would be much better than me.\n\nSorry for the long wall of text, but this is some of what I've learned and changed my perspective on and I'm wondering if any of you have come to think the same way or in some other ways that help you. Thanks.",

            "selftext": "I didn't know about this subreddit, just searched in google for some help and I found it. I hadso many goals to accomplish, I am losing my marriage just because I don't give enough time to my family, I don't go to Church anymore or to social events because I get anxiety that I am using the time I need to play... I am depressed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3 days ago I told God (I was desperate), please help me I can't control myselft... And suddenly I stopped playing, I didn't feel anxiety anymore and I promised that I will stopped playing for 40 days. (Sorry if it sounds ridiculous).\n\nNow 3 days later, I started to believe that I told that myself, why God would help for something so stupid like playing video games?... And not I am feeling that anxiety again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am gonna start reading all the post and the quick start guide so recover my hope, so please I need a good advice about completly stop playing. I am adictied to Rocket League and I am sometimes playing Red Dead Remption 2. I want to start playing Red Dead just because is online... But sometimes I feel that I need to finish the name NOW and it can't wait.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the other hand, I want to thank the person who wrote the following post: \n\n \n\n&gt;Offline games are probably less adictive because they lack the sociability, a basic human desire.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If  you are playing online with friends or acquaintences, you can lie to  yourself and say \"well, it is not that bad because I am also bonding  with people\".  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So you play for hours and  hours, so you sleep porly, so you can't focus that much in your studies  because you are tired and thinking about the game, so you won't go out  with your friends because you just arrived home friday night and is  kinda of tired. But it is all justified because you are bonding.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I  can relate very much with your story. I played more than I should, I  thought I was better than average, I believed gaming was the most  pleasurable activity in my life and was unable and unwilling to stop.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It  didn't crippled my social life or carreer: got into the top Public  Administration in my country with a Scholarship; always had pretty  girlfriends; had a lot of friends; graduated with good enough grades;  got a great job and so on. I was surely not a loser.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But  I knew something was wrong. Deep down, I knew I gamed too much; I knew I  could have achieved more if I had focused on other things; I knew I was  feeling an undesirable anxiety because of the game; I knew I sunk  thousands of hours into an activity that game back very little; I knew I  was procrastinating to do other things; I knew gaming was an escapism  that I used in order to avoid to confront some of my inner demons.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;What  do I have to show for the time and energy I spent with gaming? I can  type a little faster? I learned a little bit of English? What else? How  did it improve my life, if at all?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If I  had expent 1/10 of the time I gamed with any other skill building  activity, like cooking, playing a musical instrument, learning martial  arts, I would be an expert in any of these things.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I  tried moderation; I stoped competitive gaming; I went offline. They all  seems to work VERY well in the start. But eventually they stopped  working. Eventually you are back to playing hours and hours; you are not  reading literature that much anymore; you are feeling again that  anxiety to rush to finish other activities because you must use your  free time to play.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I really think that moderating is harder and way more exhausting then stopping cold turkey.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;You  said you are unable to stop gaming. I thought so too. But the fact is  you don't have to make the decision to stop playing forever now.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Why don't you try a 90 day detox, no gaming at all for 90 days?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;You  can learn more about how is your life without games after doing so.  Will I improve? Will I pick up new habits? Will I be happier? Will I  have a higher self esteem? Will I be bored out of my mind? Will I see my  friends more often? Will my grades improve?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;You  will not know for sure unless you try. And what are 3 months of your  life comparing to the possibility to learn more about yourself?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Half  a semester without playing, it is not asking yourself too much. The  possibilities of benefits are too great to not even try it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Cheers!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease give me a reason why I should completely stop playing games, If I am addicted to online games why I can't just play offline games? I mean, is there a way to just control myself??? I feel there is not a solution for this. The post above gives me hope, but how do I know that I can't control myself and just play RDR2 1 hours every two days?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI apologize if this post is hard to understand as English is not my first language, also I didn't mean to sound like a kid... But inside, I feel like one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading my post.",

High school, college, employment, friendships, family, hobbies, self, all wrecked or damaged by years of addiction and zoning out to play on the computer or phone. When I play I drink so they're kind of tied together but even gaming by itself puts me in a bad place. I ignore everything for fleeting comfort and then hate myself for it perpetuating a cycle of hiding and regret. I'm beginning to think all of my problems are related around addictions \u2014 hiding \u2014 from the tough work of untangling my emotions and taking positive action in my life. This morning I was ignoring my beautiful  daughter to play Peggle. Fucking Peggle. And when she snatched the phone out of my hand and said it wasn't time to play it was time to go to the store, I lashed out at her. I'm more of a goddamn child than my 5 year old. So I'm done. I don't want to set this example for my children. I don't want to ignore their lives like I ignored mine. Deleted every game and client from my PC and phone. Today is day 1.\n\nTl;do, I've wasted over half my life on gaming and other addictions and today I got mad with a child because she interrupted a dipshit casual phone game. Deleted all my games and mean to start living well in the real world.",

I wasted years in that game and now I'm just over it. I want to live my life and be amongst society and nature. I love the rain, but I haven't felt it touch me in what feels like forever. I've only left the house once so far in 2019 and that was to go get an orange soda and talk with my roommate at his restaurant. I am a shy person with ADHD and I used call of duty as a way to fade out everything. It was my escape from the world. But now I am proud to say that I haven't played COD in a week and I asked my roommate for a part time job at his restaurant as a night cleaner. I think having a job, even if it's just one 3-hour shift a week, will help me get out more and give me a sense of pride and hope for the future. I've never had a job before so I'm nervous but excited at the same time. Wish me luck!",

Recognizing all the negative emotions I felt playing these and the fact that I felt almost no positive emotion made the brain realize how useless these games are.\n\nBasically, I was not actually enjoying these games - playing them  was just a habit.\n\nBut there are games that I genuinely enjoy playing - they bring me positive emotions all the time.  \n\nFor example, couple of weeks ago I played multiplayer Minecraft for the first time. I've never played multiplayer, when I was a kid, so this sense of novelty intrigued me, and honestly, I love the every second of it. I love talking to people, I love exploring, I love building. \n\nBut then I realized, that I'm putting to much time into it and decided to quit. \nBut quitting these games is harder, because your desire to quit is not strengthened by the negative emotions you felt playing it. Motivation suffers - why should I quit this game, If I genuinely love playing it?\n\nHave you been in a similar situation? What mindset is needed to tackle this problem? I would be happy to hear your suggestions.",

            "selftext": " I have been addicted for a couple years to MMO games on mobile(SuperCell games, etc.), and I have tried again and again over the last couple months to make progress quitting, to focus on school. I delete the games, but I always end up reinstalling them. \n\nFor the last couple weeks, what I've done is deleted all other games and stepped down to an arcade game called Crossy Road, that is still played on mobile. So every time I have the urge to play, I can still partially relieve the urge, but I end up playing less, since this game has less obilgations(no online friends, no multiplayer, no daily/hourly challenges.). Another advantage is that the game gets boring after about 20 minutes, so that you don't end up losing a couple hours before you know it.\n\nThe reason that I believe this works is because of my understanding of willpower. I have spent countless hours wondering why I am unable to quit, why I don't have the willpower like some of the people who post stories of quitting on this sub and the NoFap sub. I believe that you have a changing amount of willpower. The reason that you relapse is that at that moment in time, your willpower was not high enough to overcome the addiction. By partially relapsing everytime I play Crossy Road, I am using some of my willpower to stay away from the high addiction, but still allowing myself to play the low addiction game. \n\nThis may sound pointless - \"You're just getting addicted to another game\". This is what I thought everytime I thought about it, but there IS a range of addiction for games(just like drugs - Fentanyl, Heroin, Cocaine, Weed) , and if you aren't able to step off completely, take a step down, because it truly does help.

For two years I wasted my life making fake friends online and pushing away all my real life ones. About four months ago I really got burnt out to the point where I couldnt even look at the title screen without wanting to turn it off the only thoughts going through my head \"Fuck I'm wasting my life sitting on my ass and Ill never get this time back\" I wont say gaming is bad because it isnt but with everything if you do it in excess it isn't healthy. The thing is if Im watching a movie I'm always multitasking I either draw or try to build something it could be anything so I don't feel that \"waste\" of time. All in all I can honestly say these past months of self improvement to my confidence etc. have really been the best in my life. However my friends still invite me to psn parties and text me to get on over and over again since I stopped so I tried playing something and I've never had the urge to just sell everything in that moment. Maybe I'm just pissed off because I'm bored but I really just hate video games now. Maybe someone can relate.",

I tried investing in other hobbies but they cost money, being 14 i cant get a job yet. My parents think most hobbies are useless and just tell me to study instead, theres no hope there gonna finance anything. My dad tried to push me into sports, but i hated every single moment of them.

I barely played with anyone in my family, besides my brother, who I played video games with, and he's definitely a video game addict, (and probably wasn't the best role model) and didn't really have any friends, so I grew up playing video games any chance I had. This has really affected my social skills and education. I realized that I have a gaming addiction a little over 3 weeks ago when I kept looking up expensive upgrades for video game hardware and games for the entire day that I knew I wasn't going to get anytime soon, and then I thought about how much time I've wasted playing video games. I've been trying to improve myelf over the past 4-6 months and help around the house, but the majority of the time, video games have still ran on my mind. I've been cutting back on video games quite a bit since the last 3 weeks and I try to only play video games on the weekends, using the weekdays to find other hobbies. I've found that I like drawing, baking, playing music, and LEGO pretty well as those things are all creative, relaxing and require focus. I still intend to collect and play video games, but I plan on having 30-60 minute play sessions, and I prefer to play older stuff like arcade games.",

Until today, I didn't have any idea this existed.\n\n So, I'll tell a little about my history and ask a few questions for you, sucessfully game quitters (or on the way to it)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I'm 23 and I've always played videogames, probably because I've always been a shy person, so gaming always distracted me. It never really interfere with my edication when I was at school or college because I kinda had a self control to know how to study, only with my social life, but I didnt bother too much due my shyness.\n\n But now its different, from where Im from, there are tests to get into Public Servant, which is very good, stability, more money compared to private sector, but some of them have up to 15 different subjects, so its a lot to study, and completly different from school or college, because now its a long term preparation.\n\n So, Ive been studying for about one and a half year, and during this time gaming have always been present in my life, sometimes more, sometimes less (in the beginning of this year I stayed like to month without playing anything), but yesterday I just did one of those tests and I did not very good, so now I want to/must quit for good (I do not have control to play less, moderately, if I start playing I get easily addicted).\n\n From the beginning of this year I was able to stop playing ps4, steam I would say Im good too,  even though sometimes I watch a few videos and want to return gaming. The problem now is a mobile gaming, Im really addicted to it, now its been almost 50 days since I started it, and cannot control myself because, well, I have a few nice team players, its about war, so there are lots of events and stuff to do.\n\n So, what you do to stop playing and keep it? Because one big problem I have is like after a week/month I start searching for a new games and BAM, addicted to it for another month or so. Do you think start learning an instrument, or stuff like could help?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Thanks",

( when they come over to my house i hide the computer and pretend its getting fixed)\n\nover the time they notice whats happening, im not into that crap anymore ( thats what i hope from this final attempt, im barely getting started) \n\n( i dont have the balls to straightforward tell them i wanna quit this crap , though im sure i would be 100% more effective to tell others what you really want)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ONE ANECDOTE**  \n\nThis actually happened to me some months ago when i was very excited explaining a jarvan 4 baron outplay i made to a friend. after i shared this play with him, he told me , well, actually, i quit lol, idk why but i dont find it funny anymore and there is no way in hell i would play that crap again.  to me it fell like he was kicking my balls or punching my face. that shit really hurt specially because I was so much into the game. And thats what my friends are going to feel once me ( the best player in our group) let them know that im gone for good, they will notice it as the time goes on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nplease let me know your thoughts on this post\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthis is an invitation to be challenger in real life, because im platinum 4 in lol, but my real life is bronze 4 ( fucked up grades, 0 relationships and little friends, no happiness of productivity)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthanks for reading",

            "selftext": "I'm continuing to update the lot of you on the state of my game quitting as I go along, so here comes another installment in the series.\n\nThe last I posted I was around day 35 (I think?) or something. During that time I was doing pretty miserably for a few reasons, and cravings were at their absolute worst. I'd say days 30-45 are when cravings are worst, but it's been much better since then.\n\nI'd say that my cravings are near nonexistent in the moment. Occasionally I'll become nostalgic, though I can dismiss those thoughts relatively easily. Rather, the hard part of what I'm dealing with now is trying to define a new identity. It's somewhat tempting to go back to gaming because it's what I knew, and my friends liked me better when I gamed, and they now consider me somebody who is trying to be a morally superior asshole, even though I rarely even talk about the issues with me quitting. They just think that the act of quitting is me trying to seem smug and superior to everyone else. I am currently in the process of finding new friends.\n\nI've gotten a lot done since I quit though. I've been ferociously practicing conducting and my audition for school drum major is on Tuesday. I think I have a pretty good shot, and would have never dreamed of getting the motivation and confidence to do that if I were still gaming. I've also since been getting back into learning Esperanto, and I plan to go to some local meetups for that soon (I'm rather nervous), but I've definitely found things I enjoy doing to substitute gaming. We'll see where this takes me in the future but my prospects are looking good.\n\nAs I continue this journey I think the next step is to work on my work ethic/study habits next. I'm taking the SAT again in August and hoping for at least a 1450 but that's going to require a lot of studying, but that's what the summer is for I guess. I also should probably start working out/running some, but I'm a little busy with all my finals coming up now. I plan to jump on that train starting around June 10th, when school gets out for me. \n\nOverall, things have improved, and I'm really glad I finally made it to this point. Thanks for reading, I felt like getting this out to someone at least.",

            "selftext": "Hi! I have dabbled in this forum from time to time. This is my first post, I am hoping for some advice, and just wanting to share my story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm in a really good place right now that I feel like I might lose if I don't take this opportunity to quit. I am 27, live with my parents, just graduated with a computer science master's degree, and I start my job very soon. In the last year of my degree, things got boring. I picked up an MMO to cope with how dull school was. Somehow, I maintained my GPA because I finished all the weed out classes by the time I didn't care anymore. My school work DEFINITELY suffered, and I stayed up super late gaming every night. Right now I'm trying to wake up at a normal time to prepare for work and I am constantly tried.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wanted to ask you guys, were you depressed when you stopped gaming and your online friendships suffered? Do you think online friends can be real friends? I feel like I gave up all my real life friends, and stopped hanging out with them, to play with a very small group of people. Now I'm not as interested in the game because I played it so much I burned out, and am already distanced from my gaming friends because of an argument, so I feel as if I have no close friends outside of family. I used to be very social and have a lot of friends, but gaming just seemed so much more important, so my close friends got demoted to acquaintances. I think I'm in the perfect spot to quit - I can make new friends at work, which  has many people my age, and work will fill my days so I'm no longer bored and want to play MMOs. I think I have it very lucky, and maybe an early start on quitting gaming. I really only spent about a year devoted to my MMO - my worst gaming addiction ever - so I have to break the habit before it becomes long term. I have been successful so far, because an (unrelated) personal argument with my guild just completely drained me and left me with no desire to play. This is what caused me to question what I want out of life, and if I should really be spending any time at all in a situation that is so draining when things are bad - despite being like a high when things are good. So, I reduced my time down to almost zero on the game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I just feel depressed right now. I already miss my gaming friends, who I hung out with for hours every single day. I let all my hobbies go while gaming, so the only thing I can think of to do is hang out with my parents and walk around the neighborhood. I think I'm having withdrawal. Is anyone a social gamer who had the same problem? How did you cope with the sudden loss of your online friend group? If you aren't a social gamer and have advice on withdrawal, I'm also happy to listen. Thank you for reading!",

He is single, he tells me how making friends is really just a waste of time (I am his only friend, really and that's only because I check in on him every few days). I know he isn't satisfied with his life and I know it's more comfortable for him to isolate himself gaming than to actually socialise or pick up a hobby. He also failed his theoretical driving exam because he was gaming rather than studying for it. \n\nToday he told me that he knows he has a problem, but he doesn't see a reason to change it since he doesn't really have anything apart from gaming. I think you guys can see the cycle here, his gaming isolates him and he won't stop gaming because he is isolated.\n\nI just want to help him, but I had no better ideas than saying \"Uuh, pick up a hobby\" and offering to accompany him to meetups.\n\nHow can I help him? He is a good person, he is great with kids and I know he would make a woman incredibly happy. He is very creative, too.\n\nIt just really hurts me to see such a great, talented person go to waste. I'm thankful for any advice.",

Since masturbation gets boring after a while and I don't make enough money to fund my workout plans. The only thing I can do is study something and since I have one week til the start of summer semester I started to learn front-end web development again (working on portfolio).\n\nToday I thought to myself if I  even want to go back to gaming since I'm more happier, productive, and focused in life.",

            "selftext": "Hello, I  am new to the community.\n\nI had never seen gaming as a problem in my life, mostly because I'm pretty moderate at it and it doesn't affect my performance anywhere. When I have objectives,  I am perfectly capable of pursuing them and ignore gaming. One problem that I also have, though, is anxiety, and this comes to bite me in the ass when I can't have an objective that I can work on. That is because there are two options then, I either get bored and try to find satisfaction externally, such as by gaming or watching tv, or I try to create a new objective for me to pursue. The second option is very problematic though, because as many of you who have anxiety must know, creating artificial objectives and deadlines is a very unhealthy characteristic of type A personality that can easily compound with anxiety to make you feel really bad. I used to do it, and I was a much unhealthier person then. Therapy helped me to stop doing that.\n\nThe overall outcome of this is that, for me, only one option is available, and that is trying to deal with my boredom somehow. This is where gaming comes in. During these periods of time I will be extremely tempted to start gaming. \n\nI'll usually start by googling \"best games\" whatever year it is, and then I'll read a bunch of reviews. 9 times out of ten I will decide that most of those games aren't worth my time, but the gates of hell have already been opened. So I'll go into a game I have played once in my life that satisfied me, remembering my time playing them with rose tinted glasses. \n\nThe game is usually a mmorpg, like WoW or Runescape, and I will start playing. It will make me happy for a while, but then I will start feeling this emptiness, this lack of purpose. They never fulfill me for too long because I don't feel as much pleasure playing anymore and I don't see the point on getting the rewards.  \n\nRegardless of that, I will keep playing, I will keep establishing little objectives I can attain. I will keep on pursuing that next goal and that next goal and that next goal.  The end result is that I spend lots of time doing something that doesn't make me happy, and although this doesn't affect my personal life objectives because I only do that when I have free time,  I feel this sense of emptiness on what I am doing. \n\nI wish I didn't feel like that, that I would be fine with being bored and that I wouldn't want to pursue these empty goals. I actually wanted to be able to feel good gaming, so that this problem wouldn't be a problem at all and I would be able to play games when I'm free, but it seems like I can't, so maybe if I quit it once and for all at least one of my problems will be gone. \n\nDo you guys understand my situation? Have any of you been in a similar situation? What did you do to quit and what do you do when you feel bored but you can't establish random objectives for the sake of your own mental health?",

            "selftext": "So as the title says, I haven't logged on to WoW in a week. It might not sound like much, but I've been playing wow ever since I was only 6 years old (I'm 20 now). This is a really big thing for me, and this actually might be my turning point, I haven't felt the need to log on anymore, and I somehow stopped caring about my dailies and weeklies (I played on a wrath of the lich king server, for those who know). \n\n I've spent my entire childhood, teens and even now just gaming, all day, all the time. I had no idea I was even addicted and I'm only now coming to terms with it, and seeing just how wrong things are. I wanna stop this thing in time and moderate my gaming, I don't think I ever want to stop? I love gaming so much and it feels like the only right thing to do, which is exactly what scares me, but I don't want to stop it, I just want to be able to force myself into a good routine in life, with a job and everything and learn how to prioritize that over gaming and turn it into a hobby that consumes much less of my time.\n\n All my life has been a routine, wake up, turn on the pc as soon as I get out of bed, go take a piss, sit at my pc and play or chill until I can eat, and just go back to my pc until I'd get so tired I just \\*have\\* to sleep, because otherwise I'm staying up with my friends gaming away. When I was in highschool I'd lie to my friends who would wanna meet up or hangout just so that I could rush back home at the end of the day, log on, and just play until I'm forced to sleep. \n\nThis whole deal made me sloppy on my grades, made me look away from my friends just so that I could play for another 3-4 hours that day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAre there any other people here like me? who literally let a computer consume their entire life? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess my point in all of this is that I'm proud of myself. I might finally be at a turning point and change things around. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you're reading this and you're younger than me and this sounds like you right now and your life, I just want to say that it might not seem wrong to you now, and like I used to do, you'd simply brush it off and say, yeah but I'm not like that, I can just stop, it's nothing big I'm just having fun, it doesn't REALLY have an effect on me, etc. It blinds you, and in the end, when you get that slap in the face of realizing that it did blind you, you feel stupid. \n\nI realized how productive gaming made me feel, and specifically World of Warcraft. \n\nIf I logged on that day and farmed that extra bit of gold I've been wanting, or got that piece of gear I've been waiting for for weeks in a raid, I'd feel productive, but then comes the moment when you turn off your pc, and you go to bed around 4-7am, and you feel great about how much you got done today. In reality, you're not really gaining a single thing in life and it won't get you anywhere. No one is going to give a damn irl if I downed the Lich King on a 25 man heroic raid and if all my gear is BiS (best in slot), and that's the sad truth that really hit me. I spent all my life gaming and grinding for all those things ingame, but at the end of the day, I'm nothing, gaming just made me feel like I'm doing so much and that I'm being so productive and useful. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAn important note is that I'm not rid of my addiction yet, far from it, but I'm at the first step I believe. \n\nHas anyone had a similar experience that they can share or give me any tips of how to get my life going into a normal routine if my past seems similar to yours? any opinions, advice or questions are appreciated, thank you for reading :)",

            "selftext": "I have been gaming throughout the last 20 years of my life(I'm currently 25). Started with GameBoy, went on to playstation and then pc. I always prioritized gaming over everything else. I put it before family, friends, social events, going out and even put it before multiple girlfriends. It affected my personality, it made me less social and made me struggle in a lot of social situations. It was even worse while i was gaming because i would become very toxic and angry at everyone, even if i was winning a game i would flame my teammates. It ruined my motivation to improve my self personally, socially, athletically and achedemically, basically killing all my dreams and goals. Everytime i started working out i would stick with it for 6 months at best and then i would start gaming instead of going to the gym. Every education I've been on I have started out with determination and focus and then after a few months i would start gaming and prioritize the games instead of my education. Even when i was forced into social situations, my attitude towards it would be very negative and before meeting new people i would already have decided that I didn't like them. I was never willing to participate in any social events with my girlfriend and even if I did, I would barely talk to anyone and leave early so that she wouldn't want to bring me in the future. I was a selfish, arrogant, nonsocial, stubborn and angry asshole that would rather isolate himself rather than be with other people.  \n\n\nMy current situation is this: I dropped out of university, i have no job and no money, i stopped talking to most of my friends and I severely neglected my girlfriend to the point where she broke up with me and because we broke up I'm now also without a home(I live in a small room in my dads apartment until i get back on my feet). At first i didn't even realize what went wrong and i actually agreed with her that we should break up until i started thinking and reflecting on the situation and for the first time in my life I saw that i had a problem and i was willing to admit it and take responsibility for my actions.  \nI stood there, in the ruins of my life and realized why everything was destroyed. It was because of me. Because of my gaming addiction. I started looking back at every situation in my life that had been affected by gaming either directly or indirectly. I thought about the day where my girlfriend(now ex) was in the hospital and i didn't visit her until 05:00 PM the next day because I chose to game all night and sleep 10 hours. Back then I didn't think much of it and when i finally went there and she cried and said \"Why didn't you visit me until now? Multiple of my friends have been here already but not you?\" I just brushed it off as if she was overreacting. Looking back at it now i feel like I committed a crime against her. And the worst part is that it didn't just happen once, but twice. She was put in the psychiatric hospital for 4 days because she has a depression and she had lost the will to live and once again i pulled the same stunt. I didn't visit her until the next day and I didn't stay for very long, and even while I was there I wasn't really there. My mind was at home, thinking about playing World of Warcraft and thinking that I didn't like being in the hospital because it put me in a bad mood. I never once stopped to think how she felt despite the fact that it was her, who had to sleep there and stay there 24 hours a day for 4 days straight. I was so selfish and selfcentered because the only thing that filled my mind was my game.   \nThese are just two examples of terrible decisions I've made because of my addiction out of thousands but they are the only two that i will never forgive myself for.   \n\n\nFast forward a few weeks i have now deleted and uninstalled every game on every device i own. My desktop, my laptop, my phone etc. have all been wiped for anything that resembles a game. I've started working out again and started focusing on my personal goals. I'm preparing for university by learning a few programming languages(I'm gonna study Software Engineering), I'm becoming more social and i started talking to a lot of my friends again. I'm looking for a job for the first time in years and I also started searching for a place to live. I still feel empty inside sometimes, because i lost the 2 things that has taken up the most space in my life the last 2 \u00bd years: my girlfriend and my gaming. Although gaming was always my top priority she was still a huge part of my life. I wrote her a letter telling her about my realization and the actions i have taken so far to rid me of my addiction and i asked her if she wants to go for a walk or a coffee so we could talk. I told her in the letter that she didn't have to reply today, tommorow or within this week even. I just really want to talk to her, not to get back into a relationship but just to show her how much my mindset has changed and how much i have improved in such a short amount of time. She hasn't replied and I don't think she ever will and I honestly don't blame her. She would probably have been my future wife and the mother of my future kids if i had just realized all this, just a week sooner than i did. But that's probably too late now. The last time we spoke she told me that she still loved me but the romantic feelings are gone.\n\n  \nHowever, despite all that my life is not over and my chance at happiness and a great life is not gone. I have chosen that i will never play another video game again in my entire life. Even though it's hard and I'm only 2 weeks into it i know that i will never go back to that life. The person i become when I play games is not the person i want to be and it's not the person I truly am. The life I lived with gaming is not the life I want to live. I chose to stop gaming and I'm gonna stick to it no matter how hard it is. At least it's not gonna get any harder than it is right now, being on my own without the person I love. It's tough and it sucks but at least I'm on the right track with everything in my life excluding my love life.   \n\n\nI thought I had lost everything, but instead I found myself.",

            "selftext": "Good morning everyone from /r/StopGaming,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's summer already, the sun wakes up early, the temperature is perfect and I slept really well compared to the last 2 weeks where I binged a few PC video games. I decided last week that enough is enough and that I would quit, but of course I only listened to myself 2 days ago and, with some effort of will, did not touched my games. Go me!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Where it all started:**\n\nLike all of you, what brings me here is my video games addiction. My history with video games date from when I was 4 or 5 and started playing with a friend of mine. I got addicted very quickly and at age 7 I finally received my own console and beated my first game. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friends were addicted, not I. I never thought I was addicted.  I wasn't the one playing up to 4 am in the morning. I wasn't the one trowing a tantrum when I couldn't play. I never yelled at strangers over a game or fought my friends for the remote. I was only ever midly annoyed. I played only during weekends. My parents were stricts on that. So instead I would read, I would daydream a LOT compared to other kids. That is because I was picked on heavily in elementary school...or maybe I was picked on because I daydreamed a lot and was an easy target? who knows... but video games, books an my imagination helped me escape my reality. My hero was a video game character. I would dream about games, draw, imagine and think about them during the day. I was not addicted of course not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always used games as an escape from reality, but they never were the only things, so idk how well my journey will go into being a better me, but I think its a step in the right direction!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**High School and beyond**\n\nI had my first girlfriend in high school, we dated for almost 6 years and life was good. I would play video games later in the night because I needed to make space for her. My grades suffered the consequences. The beginning of university did not go well and I choose to switch career orientation. She left, but I was happy with my choice, I still am. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI met my next girlfriend on internet playing the same game I did. it was a long distance relationship, but I only had 2 years left to my degree. Meeting her by traveling there took me about 16 hours every time, be it by car or train and plane were way too expensive for us. So we would spend every hour we could on internet. It was an escape from reality yet again and I was isolated from my life more than ever before. We would fall asleep while the connection was still on with headphones on our head. It was complete madness and very toxic for both of us. Social interaction, love, sex, video games made it really addictive. It was hard to keep up my normal life and I ended up depressed, burned out and always very anxious. Our relationship ended badly...it was catastrophic for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The end**\n\nThat was 3 years ago. Now I finished university, got a job and a place to live....and a damn computer with games that took the last 2 weeks from me. Not anymore. I used gaming as a way to entertain myself, as a way to challenge and get rewarded for my struggles. I gamed to make friends, gamed to fill my need for social connection. I gamed to learn more about many things. I gamed to escape my reality, my life, to drown my anxiety, failures and fears. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGaming will swallow me whole. I need to turn around from my monitor and face my reality so that I can start to live finally.",

It caused my grades to slip, I spent less time studying and more time gaming. It caused my sleep schedule to suffer as I would play games late into the night. It caused my social life to be based on playing games on the weekends instead of real activities with friends. It even stopped me from going to the gym. Well not anymore. I shoved that thing into the attic and pulled out all the wires. I\u2019m taking my life back. It\u2019s time to finally achieve my goals and stop being hindered from that stupid box.

            "selftext": " For a while now, I have been addicted to a video game. I have hated it for a while. Nevertheless, I could not stop playing it. It was just so much easier than doing any other hobby. \nBored --&gt; GAME\nSad --&gt; GAME\nLonely --&gt; GAME\n \n For the past year, I've been telling my self that I'm gonna quit. But only last month did I finally manage to stop..\n Strangely enough, it wasn't a slow gradual stop. I just very abruptly stopped all at once. \n These are the main reasons I think that allowed me to quit:\n- I got myself busy. Like very very busy. As I said before, the first thing I would think of doing when I had nothing to do is game. Last month, exam period started. I studied really hard, such that I had very little free time and did not game.\n- I uninstalled the game off my computer. I find it's hard to resist when it's just there in front of you. So get rid of it. Even better, desactivate your account if you can.\n- For the first 1-2 weeks, you're gonna feel reeeaal strange. So you need to find new hobbies to replace gaming. I've gotten into sports, especially calisthenics. It fills my time and is much much much more rewarding than gaming. You feel better, you look better, and there's no guilt afterwards. Of course it would be stupid to spend all of your free time exercising, cus you'd probably seriouslt hurt yourself. I found myself reading a lot, and being more social.\n\n- IMPORTANT: I have many friends who are also very into the same game. At first, I thought gaming would make me feel left out or I would be judged. But after I quit, I realised my friends also wish they could quit. Trust me, there are many many out there who just like you want to but can't stop. Besides, who knows, if you quit, they might feel motivated and follow.\n\nHope this helps!",

Something that would be too crappy to play games on but would still be decent enough to watch a movie.\n\nI was watching the Roman Empire on Netflix last month, it really got me wanting to play Rome Total War again. I've been having a hard time the last few weeks and I've been looking for an escape, I thought of how nice it would be to go back to Azeroth, maybe get some of that new heritage armor.\n\nIt's funny though if I still had a PC I would be right back into it. Today I was actually thinking about blowing my savings to buy a cheap PC and start playing again.\n\nThen I had to ask myself, do I really want to undo six months of work, and blow my savings for a pixel fix that I'll regret in a couple of days? \n\nAnyone who tells you computer gaming is not an addiction is a damn idiot.",

I've tried to quit so many times before and ended up cracking and coming back. It's mostly single player games for me. I will just sit and play for hours the fun tinged with guilt and self hatred. When I game I feel like I am choosing to be a loser, and the warm fuzzy blanket it wraps around my brain stays there when I tear myself away from the screen and fogs up my mind. I'm sick of it.

            "selftext": "I am typing this because I need to go all the way again retrospectively. To understand why and how games affected my life. It turned out to be 10x times longer than I thought, but I have TLDR down there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Long**[**-**](https://xkcd.com/37/)**ass autobiography**\n\n**Elementary, when I was just a normal child**\n\nSweet memories, I remember how my father played Spider Solitaire. I liked fireworks at the end.\n\nElementary school. Though my class was pretty nice and friendly I didn't find any real friends there and have never meet with anyone outside of the school(also i was on extended day through from 1 to 4 classes, so most of the time I communicated with people so it wasn't that bad). I spent adequate time on videogames. Like short sessions sometimes. Few games, I remember NFS: Underground and Starcraft.\n\nMy family spent summer in small town in our house. I was alone there until at 8 or 9 yo I got acquainted with few children who went there on summer, too. Our relationship wasn't strong and despite it lasted through all my school I hanged out with them only at summertime. We were from the same big city but have never met there.\n\nOn summer between 4 and 5 grades my parents decided to move to another town nearby the one where we spent summers. I spent most of 5th grade after-school time in the \"summer\" home, playing Lego(real life, not video games) and reading books, but also a lot of time I played GTA:VC, NFS: Underground, Sims 2, Sonic Adventure DX and also surfed the net.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**From elementary and through middle, when I felt like an outsider**\n\nAfter I switched schools for the first time I was that outcast guy. I wasn't scapegoat but more like stranger to almost everyone. Like, \"he is just some guy but I know almost nothing about him and have never hanged out with him and guess don't want to\". Nothing more than classmates. What didn't help my confidence and also to connect to new people and especially girls(though I didn't have a serious crush on someone) is that until I went to 10 grade I was the shortest in class. Of course I was self conscious about it. For my voice, which started to break after my classmates', too. Only in university I saw guys in my group who was below my height. I think I was surprised a bit like *oh shit, I'm not the shortest? Is this real?* Well, I'll talk about uni a bit later. Now back to school.\n\nAt 5 grade when girls had to sit with me they were like \"ok but maybe not with him\". At the end of this grade we moved to the town where school was. At summer I went to a camp where I met a guy who lived 10 minutes walk from me. We haven't become friends, but we sometimes played together after school. Not only outdoors, but also we played HoMM 3 and Postal 2. I played M&amp;B(original and Warblade after it was released).\n\nSituation at grade 6 started improving because finally I lived in the same town as my classmates and sometimes we went to our houses(few guys lived nearby) together and I started connecting with people(through talking about games too).\n\nBut my parents decided to go back to big city. So at 7 grade I had to start everything from scratch. Because till 4 grade I had an extended day and on summers I had gone to another town, I hadn't spent time outdoors there hence I hadn't known anyone in my neighbourhood and my district was terra incognita, too. I met few guys with whom I talked in school, and with one of them we call each other friends till today(but our friendship was based on games to a large extent).\n\nAt New Year Eve I got new PC with MW2 and first AC. I dropped AC series on Revelations which I haven't even finished, heh. It was powerful enough to run most of the games(not on high, true) and more importantly I installed GTA 4 there(my previous PC couldn't do even this, after endless process of installing it refused to run). I tried some MMORPGs but dropped them pretty early(PW on \\~20-30 lvl, others I don't remember). But then I read books(mostly sci-fi classics), parents used my PC to work, so my time on games was limited.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**High school, when it all went worse**\n\nI switch schools again, connect to a guy from old elementary school(thx social networks). Mostly we play games. BF3, Planetside 2. New peers through games. I found out Minecraft. That's where shit hit the fan. Because I didn't have real friends outside of gaming circle and I could get nice grades without spending much time(unlike one of my peers who slipped to bad grades and got punished by parents, and it was hs, lol) on it I fucking lived Minecraft. And when I went multiplayer it worsened everything.\n\nMC lit up something in me. For a second. I wanted to create mods. I tried Java. I created my own block and it worked. And than I dropped it and just continued playing. Once the server where we played got wiped so admins could add some ridiculous mod packs and destroyed mine and my friends' \"work\"(it wasn't beautiful). We switched few more servers. We played on small local server. We tried to create our server, but than we dropped it and just continued playing. Mainly by inertia. Another server wipe was last trigger and we left MC.\n\nI played it a bit later. But that stage was definitely over.\n\nI stopped playing so much. I found Stephen King. I read a lot of him.\n\nIt was high school, it was a year before graduation one I found steam. That's when shit really, *really* hit the fan. I played fucking much. Graduation year started, and I still played much. I didn't know what do I want. Oh, wait, of course I thought I could be programmer and make games. Because games are cool, right?d But in fact I didn't ask myself whom would I liked to become. I don't think I thought about the future. I got games and they gave me the illusion that they gave me everything what I needed.\n\nI tried drawing. The next day I dropped it and just continued playing, because it was unexpectedly and time-consuming.\n\nMy parents decided I needed training courses before exam(smart move); there were many new people, and most of them went outdoors on break for social smoking. I didn't smoke. I stayed in class, and teachers spoke to few who remained or we just stared at phones. There was one girl who stayed in class always. She was just... Normal. It wasn't attraction, she just was comfortable to talk to. After the last class at the course before exams we went outside together speaking some light themes. I realized that I see her last time and this is the last time I can ask her for contact(at least fb). I didn't ask. We literally went to different directions after just \"bye\". I was okay with that. I went back to games. I played on one of community servers that time.\n\nAfter the course but before the exams I came to that building where we had courses again due to some organizational issue and met one of young(\\~25 yo) teachers, and we spoke a bit. He said he played Dota a lot, but stopped this. From what I remember, the main idea that he tried to explain to me is that games are just... Games. That I don't necessarily have to drop them but there is whole world around me and I should try live life outside games, too.\n\nI came back to home and continued playing.\n\nI passed the exams with good grades. I didn't try to do my best. I didn't learn it as good as I could. I didn't want to get at cool uni. I didn't want to become someone. Without the courses I would fuck it up I think because there I was forced to learn.\n\nI didn't know which university should I apply. My parents helped me to choose one, but mostly I didn't care.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**University, when shit continued but then I made a right turn**\n\nI got into uni.\n\nI didn't found any friends there.\n\nBecause I didn't try to.\n\nProbably if someone started to befriend me I would.\n\nI stuck to one guy who was \"ok\". Also he played games too. I played some of them. Sometimes we played together. We sat together and chatted about stuff.\n\nOutside of uni I met him two times.\n\nWhen I came home I played on that community server and some other games too. After some time community server closed. I created mine. Its life was short, and it wasn't a good one. Because I couldn't force myself to invest time and understand how it works well.\n\nMy grades were very meh. Studying wasn't easy. Because I played almost all of my free time. I had to force myself do something at home and usually I failed. I did all assignments at the last date. Few of them were done from zero literally at the night before. My maximum was to learn something few days before exam(which resulted in meh grades on exams). I encouraged myself with games(few days without games, but after exam you will play any time you want!). Sometimes I played instead of learning the day before exam.\n\nI wanted to create a game. I knew I could. I started it.\n\nAfter first evening I dropped it and just continued playing. As usual.\n\nI read rare.\n\nMy fuse to my server burned out after few months. It lasted further only because few people who became admins were interested in it. They asked me to add or implement something. I didn't give a fuck at that point, but sometimes did what they asked for. After some time average online was 0. I closed it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Turn #1**\n\nI realized that not only I am at the middle of course that I am totally not interested of; I have to start working soon, and I don't know a shit; all my gaming peers are not interesting for me, because most of them are interested in games; I don't have non-gaming peers; I am not interesting, because last years I was interested mostly in games and a bit in IT, but I almost didn't listen to music, didn't see most of the classic and modern films, read almost nothing; I got used to not thinking and not solving problems; what is more, I haven't experience many, many things I could, instead I experienced repetitive gameplay; I felt empty. Why bother when you can just play and get your comfortable pleasure?\n\nI decided I need to read more. I decided I should go to gamedev as a developer after uni, but now serious. I stopped gaming. I came back. I decided to drop online games, I wasn't interested in them anymore \u2014 they needed much more commitment I could gave after that realization struck me. I continued playing roguelikes. I felt pleasure when playing.\n\nThere were this group of my classmates who were interesting people. I thought it was too late to become friends with them. I haven't tried. It was wrong decision. Even if we won't become friends I should.\n\nI continued playing single-player games. I couldn't join the smooth flow of studying. I haven't improved till the end of uni. I thought about game jams. I haven't tried. I read a bit more, but still a little. I watched some films. I listened to some groups.\n\nI could have found new peers in real life through uni since I didn't talk to most of my gaming peers anymore.\n\nI started to get bored of roguelikes.\n\nI finished uni.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Turn #2**\n\nI took my time, forced myself to learn programming language to be better than \"Hello world!\" level. I found a job as a junior developer. Sometimes I still feel empty; I think it will stay with me forever.\n\nI realized that reading books and watching films is interesting. You just need to choose what you read. That good literature and cinema requires effort from your side too to interpret and process it. That good music could bring joy.\n\nI realized that gaming is dull. It is constructed for you to enjoy it. You have to play by the rules. Gaming gives you pleasure. But it don't give you many, many things. It is masturbation, only worse, because it gives less pleasure and need more commitment. \n\nI didn't want to play video games anymore since they were just boring to me.\n\nI didn't want to create video games anymore not only because I learned more about dark sides of gamedev(crunches, monotony, dirty hard work, etc.) but mostly because I didn't want to create such horribly deceptive content.d \n\nI deleted my steam account \u2014 I don't need it. I lost these years of my life and wish I did something else but luckily for me I am at the start and have enough time not to miss my youth(22 yo now). I have goals now. I am moving forward to them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion and TLDR**\n\nAt elementary I was a normal child but I didn't have any real friends(friends friends). At middle and high school I had difficulties on making new acquaintances. Partly because I switched schools, partly because I was self-conscious about my body and appearance. Partly because after some time I didn't want to anymore when I got seriously involved into games. Yes, games. From middle to high school I played more and more, until at high school it peaked and started to eat almost all of my free time. If I got interested in something and tried to do something, I dropped it shortly after because:\n\n* I needed to invest my time in it;\n* I won't get a result immediately;\n* Games gave me pleasure with little effort from my side;\n\nAt the end of high school I was trapped: my rl peers were bonded through games such were my gaming peers and we I mainly played with them in my free time, and I haven't tried to find new peers because I thought I have many. When you play it looks like you don't have time on anything else \u2014 not on films, books, walking around or people. At the same time when you play all you experience is gameplay(designed specifically to pleasure you), while life goes forward. And it's a shame not to try rl at least before escaping from it. Which I did \u2014 just escaped instead of living.\n\nAt uni I realized some stuff(turns #1 &amp; #2) and quit gaming, at fist turn I forced myself out from online gaming, second turn happened by itself when I realized that I spent so much time on masturbation-like(but worse) thing and also when games became just boring to me.\n\nThis is my story. How is it compared to yours? What is your gaming path and is it over?",

            "selftext": "I have not played any games for the last few days but started having a inner-debate about gaming. My coworkers and friends who do not play video games all talk about shows and movies they watch. I realized that ultimately TV and the like are essentially the same thing in terms of the principles and issues raised as to why I wanted to stop playing video games. I have not gained any appreciable skills from my hours of gaming outside of that specific area, but watch movies and shows are even more time wasting if this is the barrier that is being used to say why I should quit playing games. I would only play games for a few hours a week and never watched shows as I always felt worse about sitting down and doing nothing for two hours whereas with gaming I at least had a return of in-game progression. When you stop gaming do you also stop watching TV or movies too? Or are the two activities equally unproductive and it's an either/or situation? I'm curious as to what others feel on this matter.",

I'd love to start playing again.\n\nEverything in my life is going really well and I have a fair bit of free time available to me. I'm about to graduate with a BS in Mechanical Engineering, and have a pretty sweet relationship going with someone I really love. I feel like I am in a good place, and have enough free time to play games. \n\nGaming has always been a big part of my life (sometimes too much so), and it feels somewhat wrong to leave it behind forever. Right now the only thing keeping me going on my stopgaming streak is that I set myself a goal of beating my previous stopgaming record (\\~540) days.\n\nThat's why I feel like I want to game again. Without reverting to cliches like, \"well you posted here so that means you have a problem\", please tell me why I should or shouldn't play some PUBG.",

            "selftext": "Hi guys,\n\nI'm new to this subreddit but would like to post my story just to get it off my mind and get to sleep. Its 3am here and I just got off a LoL binge. \n\nMy relationship with league has always gone like this: I know I'm addicted to the game, but would just delete it from my computer and hop on every few months generally after exams or on holidays. I'd play with the regular people I found on league but then would keep playing until they went to sleep. Most of the time I'd play til late and delete it again, or at most keep it for 2-3 days. I feel like I've just got that addictive part of my brain deep down I can't get rid of.\n\nThese last few months have been particularly bad tho. Internet has gotten way faster in my area these days, at uni I can re-download in about 40min and at home about 3 hours. Also, I recently started doing a lab-based honours project that has given me a lot of anxiety (cell lines contaminated, constant waiting and trouble shooting). I guess this year I rediscovered the anxiety part of my brain that had been lost deep down until this year also (the last instance being the social anxiety I got pretty bad when I started uni 3 years ago now). Anyways, I guess today the anxiety from labwork was pretty bad, so I reinstalled as a coping mechanism I guess. I have played about 11 hours in the last 24 hours, which is way out of control.\n\nAnyways, I'd appreciate any advice/insights on how to quit LoL. My brother deleted his account permanently and it worked out for him. In the meantime I'll try to get some sleep.",

There's a video game I've been playing for the last four years and it's began really impacting my life. \n\nI find it really satisfying and calming, but it's gotten to the point that I'll play for 10+ hours without eating, drinking, or using the bathroom. So far my grades haven't suffered and I've managed to tear myself away for the really important things, but I'm now meant to be writing my dissertation and I can't motivate myself.\n\nWhenever I'm away from home, I think about going home and playing, my attention span is shot, if I play for too long I begin struggling to string sentences together - it's starting to impact my other hobbies and interests. \n\nI keep thinking it's okay because I can still go out and do things, but if I'm spending time with someone I'll literally be thinking, 'ok, since I'm here with a friend the gaming isn't so bad, because if it really was bad I wouldn't have come out at all.'\n\nWhat should I do? I deleted the game and am now thinking i'm just overreacting, but is playing for even a few hours a day really damaging if I get this hung up on it? Should I just completely remove it from my life, or is there a way of finding a balance?\n\nI obviously really enjoy playing it but struggle to find a way to balance it with the rest of my life. I've always known I have an addictive personality so I've avoided alcohol, drugs, cigarettes and more, but now this has crept in and I'm feeling very uneasy.",

I\u2019m that stereotype with an unruly beard, getting fat so quickly I\u2019m getting stretch marks, and everything else in my life has fallen apart, broken, or I\u2019ve given up on because I\u2019d rather spend 16 hours a day gaming. I\u2019m living off a decent inheritance in a house my mom left me. I have no job, no friends, and no responsibilities so I spend every waking moment gaming or eating fast food and getting high. I sleep when I want and however long I want, waking up whichever part of the day and just sit on the couch playing Xbox. \n\n5 years ago I was doing the same thing and life hasn\u2019t gotten better. Life is meaningless and I\u2019m always on edge and shaky because I play competitive games literally every waking hour. February of 2018 I quit gaming for a month then started again once March started. It was hard and I simply replaced games with Netflix. This time I want to do better and make it permanent. \n\nI need distractions from the boredom that comes with quitting so I\u2019m going to start cooking meals, learn guitar, and exercising. I want to start reading books and train my dogs better. I imagine the next few months will suck so I was hoping for advice and suggestions on hobbies and ways to fill my time. So, so much time to fill.",

I hv been trying to get rid of this hobby for atleast 3 years now but never been able to get past detox plan of 90 days uptil now. \n FOUND A NEW HOBBY IS THE KEY TO SUCCESS\n Although i relapsed couple of days back, but i enjoyed reading novels more than i played games . \nAlso i want point out that if u hvnt fiind a new hobby , dont go back . Its very probable thar games wil suck u back in . I observed that when i left games, i left them out of boredom, but during my couple of days with games, i enjoyed them but i again leaving them, not bcz of boredom but bcz of other hobbies i hv  adopted now . And i know if i hvnt adopted new hobbies, i would be sucked into this world once more . \n Leaving games alone wil not solve it, finding new and healthy hobbies is the key",

Currently, they are just sitting on my desk, unplugged (my Nintendo Switch and Xbox One X). The problem is, after I finish my homework every day I usually just chill and watch youtube, but I keep wanting to go back and like check out some of the new updates to my favorite games. I think the problem may be that I still watch other people play the games I like, which makes me want to play them too. Should I just sell my consoles to get over these urges or is there another solution? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS: I have these every single day where I get really close to plugging in my xbox and connecting it to a monitor but I always stop myself and idk what to do so if you guys could help me that would be great.

I always get nostalgic feelings over fun moments I had on the game that aren't even that old.

Let's just not play anymore.\n\naccording to the time wasted on lol website I wasted about 176 days of my life to play League of Legends and I'm here to stop it now.\n\nI didn't really look through the stuff on this subreddit, but the few thinks I saw was that people struggle with things to do other than Gaming. I don't think I'll have this problem. I have a lot of books I have to read, I need to do a lot of stuff for Uni that I keep procrastinating away from. \n\nLet's just hope for a new beginning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know if and how long I will keep this up, but since it's an evening wish I guess it's not gonna be that long. I'll do my best to hold it as long as possible.\n\nAs with any other addiction, I know going cold turkey is kinda... difficult. But I'm confident I can make it. There's a lot of things to keep me distracted so I'll be looking forward to that.\n\nPray for me if you're religious because I'm not and there wouldn't be any prayer if you didn't pray for me. You know?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone feels like joining me, because he just red this post and realized or whatever, I'd be glad. :)  \nIf you too started to stop or want to but didn't manage to do so. Try it again. At some point it will work. Take small steps. Don't be an idiot like me. Or just be dumb enough to actually do it. Because I hope I'm the latter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading my random rant with a wish",

            "selftext": "I play videogames like it's a full time job. I've played average 8 hours a day for the past year. \n\nI graduated from law school last year in May, and have since failed the bar exam twice. The first time I took the exam, I stopped playing cold turkey from may-August. I mean not even one minute. I completely lost interest because I was so focused on studying. \n\nAfter I took the exam in May, I had to wait until November for results. I suddenly found myself with a ton of free time. It was super hard to find a job after I took the exam because nobody wants to hire an unlicensed law grad with a super uncertain future. So to pass the time, I played videogames every day all day. I took breaks to hang with my gf and friends, but I spent most of my time gaming. November came, and I find out I failed. \n\nThe next exam was in February. This time, I continued gaming while I studied. It became a problem because I wanted to rush studying to get back home and play. I rationalized it in my head that I had done enough, but now I failed again so apparently it wasn't enough. \n\nI am planning to quit cold turkey again so I can study again, may-August. But what happens after? I don't want to be bored as hell with nothing to do, and I don't have the finances to go places or do things that require too much money. \n\n\nTL;DR: What do I do with my spare time (besides gaming) if I'm hopelessly unemployed waiting for exam results for months?",

            "selftext": "  \n\nJust my thoughts on competitive games and why they are so enticing for some of us. These are games like LoL, DOTA, Overwatch, CS:GO. Pretty much anything with a ranking system.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPretty much all of us have a natural competitive drive built into our personality. This is the drive that makes us want to improve at something, to be better than others.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor me, it was the same competitive drive that made me sink 8+ hours into League of Legends everyday while I was in university so that I could get diamond. Looking back on it, it is so easy to see how the game slowly and insidiously took over my natural competitive drive which I should have channeled into real life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe worst part is these games are designed specifically to do this, they are designed to be more appealing than real life. Think about it, the more time someone plays the game, the more likely they are to purchase skins, cosmetics, etc. Game developers are companies, at the end of the day their purpose is to generate as much profit as possible. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUltimately, we must understand that these games are basically meaningless. Unless you are striving to go pro and turn your competitive gaming into a real career (Which is not the case for 99.99% of us) these games are offering us nothing more than an easy, flashy way to expend our competitive fire. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently read a post on here (Titled: How do you play anything competitive without feeling like absolute shit?) and have had pretty much the same experience as that person. This being that I have quit multiple times (ranging from 2 weeks to 3 months) but always come back to competitive games thinking I can handle them. However, this ALWAYS leads me to playing more and more trying to climb up the ranks and improve at the game. Now I think I understand why I cannot play these competitive games in moderation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe problem with competitive games is that they offer an instant-gratification way for us to expend our competitive fire. If we wanted to compete in real-life arenas, such as business or sports, it would take much more pain, hardship, and uncertainty. With games, you play a ranked game and see the results right away. Your rank goes up or down instantly. Not to mention, gaming its self is an extremely stimulating activity that is constantly providing us with that sweet dopamine. So not only do we get to compete, we get to feel really really good while doing it. See the problem?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn real life, everything becomes so much harder. For example, lets say I want to compete in the realm of business and create a successful online store. Not only is it uncertain if I will even be able to make a single sale, but it is going to require a ton of work that is going the be mundane and repetitive (creating a website, finding/sourcing products, creating a marketing plan, etc.). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot to mention, in the initial stages of building the store, I may feel even worse than I did before, because I will have to face the reality of my inexperience in that business arena. I will basically become the \u201cnoob\u201d, the person that in games we often chastise and ridicule. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo not only do I have to face my ego, I must accept the reality of real life that not everything is gamified to be more pleasant, exciting, and dopamine inducing. Oh, and not to mention the tens or even hundreds of hours I must put into the store before I get my first sale, the first inkling of positive reinforcement. Whereas games are providing this positive reinforcement literally constantly to keep players hooked. An example of this comes to mind in League of Legends. Even if you do not kill a single enemy player and overall have a terrible game, you are still being positively reinforced by all the flashy colors and sounds the game is bombarding you with. Something that always gives me that dopamine hit is the noise and animation when you successfully last hit a minion to earn gold.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, as you can see, it is not hard to see why competitive games are so enticing to us over real life goals/activities, and why we tend to gravitate to these games *every single time* when given the choice. And the more competitive the individual is, the more they will be attached to the game. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay, that is all great and all, but how do we overcome all these obstacles and rise above the games? The first step is realizing that your competitive ranking in these games is pointless. Yes, I know it hurts. For me, I\u2019ve spent over 4000 hours playing League of Legends, so it is literally painful to say those 4,000 hours and shiny diamond icon/border are completely and utterly worthless. But that is reality, and we must accept reality no matter how painful it is. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce you come to this realization, and I mean TRULY believe this, you will have no problem quitting the games. However, now you must face the hardest part of the whole process, and that is finding out a new channel for your competitive fire. The only way to do this is to experiment, try out everything that you have ever had an interest in. Eventually something will stand out. Now its not going yell out to you \u201cHERE I AM YOUR LONG LOST PASSION\u201d but something will be more interesting than other things. Simply start investing more and more time into this activity. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRemember, its going to be hard at first. You are going to be a \u201cnoob\u201d and you are not going to see results right away like you did with gaming. But, if you keep investing more and more time and energy into something, if you stick with it long enough, you will start to see progress. And over time, with each decision that you make to not game and to pursue this new competitive activity you will slowly find it easier, more satisfying, and more rewarding. The key is to reach the point where your replacement activity for gaming starts to positively reinforce itself, so you feel like doing it over and over again, just like you used to feel with gaming. Let\u2019s use the same example of an online store. You want to reach the point where you start generating sales and money starts flowing into your bank account. For most people, this would be enough positive reinforcement for them to continue building the store, even when faced with the decision to game!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust an example of something that I have decided to focus on to replace gaming is stock trading. For me, it started with an interest in poker and blackjack, which I explored until I eventually came upon stock trading. Something about staring at graphs for hours a day to make money interested me, and as I explored the field further I found myself growing increasingly passionate about it. Just like gaming, I found myself automatically putting more and more time into it, and so far I am very happy with the overall result. I could go into more detail of why stock trading is so great for former gamers, but I will leave that for another post  :) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo those who read this entire thing, I hope you found it of value. Competitive games can grip us like no other, but if you re-channel your competitive energy into other activities you can have truly stunning results!",

            "selftext": "My brother used to have a social life and have friends and talk to them. Then around the age of 14-15 he got into LoL. He became addicted to gaming overall. Fast forward 5-6 years later, we never see him. He stays in his room 24/7, only emerging for food. We go days at a time without seeing him. All his jokes, videos that he watches, conversations with other humans are all video game related. I can\u2019t remember the last time we had a real talk.\n\nHe made friends on some games and now only talks to them through discord. Some of my irl friends are in the discord, but none of them are as addicted as my brother. \n\nHis health has started to deteriorate. Image a 24 something guy having to have surgery cuz he killed the tissues in his butt from sitting forever. He goes to bed at 8am and sleeps till 5pm. There have been numerous times he\u2019s almost missed work had I not been there to wake him up. He\u2019s also become outrageously overweight, to the point that it\u2019s just disgusting.\n\nNow he\u2019s moving out and I\u2019m worried as to how his life will deteriorate even more without me or my parents there to help remind him of important things he has to do. \n\nI know my brother has depression (he\u2019s been diagnosed) but I\u2019m trying to help him. What are the best things I can do to help? I know his life will soon go to shit if nothing is done. Worst off, he doesn\u2019t even realize he\u2019s addicted. Hours go by and he doesn\u2019t even realize the time. The concept of reality has become warped in his mind. I genuinely think this addiction will ruin his life soon.\n\nAny advice is helpful, thanks!",

            "selftext": "On uni break, I feel like a void opens up and my life becomes consumed by video games and other crap, as I have no structure. Even if I have summer classes and am going to start a job, I have skipped most of the lectures so it doesn't do much. Not only that something about this season makes me the laziest out of all year. \n\nOnce exams were over I had plans for summer. Go out have fun with money from work, work out, etc. But what I have done so far is fuck up my sleep schedule waking up at 2pm, go to gym at the very last hour of the night, and become consumed in fictional worlds. I am not a traditional gamer in that I focus more on the roleplay aspect of it but it still fuels my escapism to the max. I know this is the stereotype of that I'm not a real gamer because I'm a gamer who focus on the roleplay aspect but it still affects my life just as bad. \n\nI love writing fictional characters, creating long plots and back stories. It's been a primary coping mechanism for life struggles over the years But this quickly gets time consuming, and so addictive that I can stay glued to my chair for over 8 hours. Usually in summers past I was on international vacations sponsored by my father, but as divorced recently, I've come to realize with no one forcing me something to do I become rather useless.\n\nIt doesn't help my other parent endlessly compares me to other women and complains why I can't be like them. The women who have every weekend nights out and are bubbly loud etc. (especially in my culture) I do realize I'm abnormal - sometimes I lose hope and wonder if I'm too far gone, because although I look fine on the surface once people get below that they realize I'm off.\n\nI realize my biggest problem is that someone else had always taken initiative for me, whether that be my father berating me for not being disciplined, friend forcing me to be more outgoing, etc. Once that is gone I have no will of my own and become apathetic, reverting to... well, whatever this is. \n\nThe times in my life where I HAVE been successful were because I had competition, like high school, but since I already got into the good uni I slipped back into laziness. And become this. Don't know how someone can easily spend weeks wasting away on the computer mostly but apparently I've accomplished just that.",

Also with my Origin, uPlay, and other ones that are very well known to all of you. I just don't like playing anymore, maybe when I was younger it was all good because it's an entertainment that I can rely on to if I needed to escape from reality, I had just turned 20 last month and I feel like shit, I feel like I am left behind from the people my age. Gaming is just making me to hate myself for not being able to do anything productive. Maybe I'll get back again once I get my shit together but right now it's not the best. I can not change myself for the better if I won't be honest with myself and that means acknowledging what I want to change. Hopefully this doesn't sound too cringy to y'all but it's something I have been thinking of since the start of the year, now it's already May. 5 months have passed and yet I'm still stuck. Also gaming is making me depressed because it reminds me of the better times when I was younger, and maybe I only thought it was the better times because I was younger and innocent so I did not really care about reality other than my happiness. I will make it through a month and I will come back here and hopefully post a little update.",

He played Diablo for years IIRC.  Now he\u2019s the foremost thoughtleader on how to gamify tech startups\u2019 UX.  \n\nThe book is so interesting because he breaks down all the various mechanics of a game that make it addicting.  He\u2019s literally reverse engineered what makes games addicting and for those here I think it might help to see their relationship with games from a dissected angle.  It might help you understand the mechanisms that keep you hooked, and if you can understand those mechanisms you might better be able to escape them by recognizing them for what they are.\n\nHis model is called Octalysis, which you can search on google images for a visual breakdown of what it is, but it basically categorizes all the various game mechanics into sections like \u201cblack hat\u201d and \u201cwhite hat,\u201d extrinsic vs intrinsic, etc.  \n\nAnyways, if one person finds this interesting or helpful then good stuff. Cheers and good luck to you all!",

Been playing games on anything since 7, now 15. At this point i realise that although this hobby was enjoyable a couple years ago, now i just play because i \"have to\". I play because im used to it, and now i rarely enjoy the games i play, i just rage and swear a lot. This also has an impact on my school results. Although im nowhere near hardcore in terms of a student, i tend to neglect many important assignments which can affect if i pass the year. The assignments are there in my head but i just keep on playing. And today, i am going cold turkey for the 3d time. And this time i want it to count.\n\n\n What are some of the strategies you guys use to avoid relapsing and thinking \"maybe my addiction wasnt so bad afterall\"\n\n(most of the times i failed because i convinced myself that videogames didnt play an effect on my life when they did)\n\nThanks for reading",

            "selftext": " \n\nHello,\n\nI have little ..not a problem per se it's like question/dilemma on my hand. Little background story. Now like most of people of my age (mid 20) i am in gaming most of my life. Never had serious issues with addiction but i use to spend a lot of time years back sitting at PC or TV gaming. First time i become aware that it takes a lot of time was in WoTLK *(Wraith of The Lich King - World of Warcraft)*, after that realization i just stop playing games. Middle school ended, High School started and then i played a COD 4 *(Call of Duty Modern Warfare)* in ,,serious\" competitive mode. That was a first time i found out about real competitive games. After that LoL *(League of Legends)* and then *(Now)* Overwatch. It's not that i ,,need\" that competitive side of games, it's just matter of fact that every online friend i had/have was playing some of those games. So i just went with it. It was fun, sure, but as soon i saw myself getting mentally tired of them, i either quit or stop playing for some time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow thing is i didn't know back then, but after some suicide attempts and living that depression is my default state, we found out that i'm bi polar. Then things changed. I started noticing bad patterns in Online gaming *(competitive mostly)*that it's bad for my state. Tilting, ,,salty\", getting mad over MMR.. just to name a few made me feel bad in real life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, after 11 seasons in Overwatch i believe it's enough stress for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThing is, i like playing games. Now i've read people who had issues with gaming and that their lives suffered, but i'm not in that problem. Gaming was just one of those things where i either read a book, play a game or watch an anime. But i've been so much and so long into Overwatch for example that i don't know what games i can play now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI enjoy Single Player games with puzzles like Tomb Rider and hack/slash Devil May Cry/Castlevania series..on PS3 *(friend borrowed me his)* i played The Last of Us, God Of War etc.. so question: **What and how i can see what games i can run with my now old PC..and how to research about specific genres? Is there any site?** Now simple ,,GoOgLe GeNrE luLlU 4Head\" is not exactly best because there is a lot of Mainstream games i either can't run or they are all about Online competitive or grind, grind, grind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCpu: i5-3570\n\nGpu: Gtx760OC\n\nRam: 8 GigaPickles\n\n1080p 60hz\n\nPlaying on Low Medium is totally fine with me.",

            "selftext": "One year ago I complained on this sub because of short attention span, generally low energy and overall no interest to focus on thing at at time. I played fleshed out games with bright colors, games which have a ranking system, tournaments on livestreams and games which had no end. To name a few, these would be Starcraft 2, Fortnite and similar games. One day I started playing an old classic, Zelda Link to the Past. After the first 5 minutes I couldn't really be patient enough to play the game. Solving puzzles, walking is slow, no flashy points, kills or exp. Just an old school game. That was when I came to this sub and complained that okay my grades may be trash, or I don't go to the gym (bad enough) - but now I can't enjoy regular games anymore. It always has to be *quick, easy. mindless and rewarding.* This is the sad part.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShort after that realization I played less and less because of upcoming exams. Around a month ago I knew I would have more free time this summer and installed Steam. Since I don't have a gaming PC anymore, I was only able to play really old games on intel graphics. I installed games like Fallout 2 / Baldurs Gate which are super slow paced, combat is not really \"fun\" rather tactical and most of the time you are *reading text*. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would never have thought of this but now I play these games daily. It seems like I recovered attention span and my ability to focus while I had a break free from games. Well, now I play these slow paced games daily for *around a hour.* Which is kinda bad, because the gained abilities could be used for other tasks. At the same time it's *funny*, because first I was spoiled with these modern dopamine pumped games and hated slow paced games - but now after a break I enjoy them again and play them daily.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWill I go cold turkey after this? Most likely, because I start reading up on the lore of these games and it really takes up space in my head. There are guides, blogs and wall of texts of games which are heavily based on story/lore. There must have been some really hard nerds who explored every nook of these games - which is not easy. Instead of understanding and learning all the ingame stuff, I could use that time and focus to improve in coding (or any other skill). \n\nThis is just my story which I wanted to share :)",

Talking to friends of mine and knowing my rank is higher than theirs makes me feel better\n\n- There are many aspects of my life that struggle because of this habbit\n\n- I haven't played for 2 days and want to stop",

            "selftext": "Just wanted to share this with you all here. \n\nSo yesterday was finally my graduation ceremony. I wont acctually know if I gratuated (I dont think I did) for another two weeks or so till I get my grades, but thats not important for the story.\n\n Before comencement started O talked to a buddy of mine that I used to constantly play a certain game with online. Hes moving away for at least the summer but was saying hed have his computer with him so we could game sometimes and he became pretty heartbroken when I told him that I made it impossible to get into that account anymore. \n\nLater when I was sitting through the ceremony I was thinking back on the last few years of college and reflecting on how I thought my journey went. Listening to the super successful students on stage, and presentation about honors graduates and such, I realized I had so many regrets. Now dont get me wrong, I know its not good to be so hard on yourself, and I wasnt hating the four years and being a downer. I was thinking that there was alot I would certainly like to change and do better. I want to focus on my social relationships that I threw away gaming, work hard on whats important every day, and build a real life thats successful instead of a virtual one. I resolved that I would work my ass off  every day from that point forward to become the best version of myself.\n\nThen an hour or so later while they were taking forever calling everyones names, I glanced at my phone and scrolled through a reddit page. I didnt even see a reference to a game, but saw an image that reminded me of a game. And suddenly I had all these panic feelings rush in that I should try and recover my game accounts and stop them from being deleted, and how now that school was done I would have more time anyways, and how I would miss my play time with my friend, and how I could control it. A million thoughts came rushing in about me needing the games back. \n\nAnd then I looked up to see an honors graduate getting special recognition in his degree, and having so many more friends than I had there cheer for him from the audience and grad pool. I realized that just 20 minutes before I had decided to exemplify extraordinariness and yet gaming was already fighting me trying to steer me from that path. All those thoughts of getting my accouts back faded away and I realized that if I wanted that on stage, I cant have fake fun in a computer. \n\nIts to shocking me how much control and influence this \"hobbie\" has over my life. Remember to keep the demons at bay and remind yourself of what you want most. Each day theyre gonna try knocking you off track but you need to remember why you quit in the first place. Its time for a better future free from virtual control.",

            "selftext": "I think it was a year or two ago that I took a stab at not gaming anymore. I made it a few weeks before I settled on taking a more moderate approach to gaming. That may come off as a failure to kick the habit, but I learned a lot from that few weeks. In fact, up until very recently I've done a (mostly) great job of balancing gaming and the important things in life. I developed much healthier relationship with gaming than I had before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what's changed that makes me want to try it again? Well my wife and I are expecting twins (boy and girl if anyone's wondering! EXCITED!) in August and there's literally no way I'll be able to game even moderately with all that going on. I suspect the urge to game simply won't be there when I'm up to my eyes in diapers and screaming babies, but I still want to curb my gaming appetite a bit in the meanwhile. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, lately my ability to keep gaming to a minimum has failed. I've been really getting into Fallout 76, which despite the rumors is actually quite fun for what it is. I've got a million things to do to prep for these babies and I'd rather hum \"Country Roads\" while shotgunning mole miners in the face. I have anxiety, depression, and ADHD and as you can imagine gaming has been a great distraction from that. Especially now when there are two massive sources of stress heading my way. But when relief comes at the expense of important things in your life, maybe you need to reassess things a bit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also feel immature playing games like I do. I don't really know anyone my age (30s) that plays like I do, but then again most of my friends have had kids since their 20s. I don't know if that really *does* suggest an immaturity in me or not, but the feeling is enough to help compel me to quit. And if I am immature to an extent, I can't imagine that's anything two adorable babies can't fix.",

Sometimes it is really tempting to grab the controller or start up your PC and play a game after a while, but you just have to force yourself that playing video games isn't the only way you can get enjoyment from. After I quit gaming on the first day I looked for new hobbies since I was getting bored and didn't know what to do. I started a new hobby. Arts, and I really enjoy it now! I feel more refreshed in a way after quitting video games. I spend more time with my family and I have more time to study. I want to thank this reddit community for helping me get past my very bad addiction. I will update you guys after another week.",

I've been reading a few of the posts on this subreddit and it has motivated me to quite gaming for 2 months.\n\nI'm an artist and sometimes it is difficult to start a new piece of work. It's even harder when I have a very time consuming gaming problem. I can remember countless times I have sat down to start a painting or a drawing and gave up to spend the rest of my day gaming. Activities that make time fly without getting much done I call \"Time Machines\". Gaming has definitely been a time machine for me as has YouTube and Netflix. I hate how far I have come and done so much less than I could have. This is why I am going to stop time traveling. \n\nOn the 20th of May (my birthday) I am going to be reborn in a sense. I will be someone who no longer cowers away from my passions to sit back and watch others do them. For the next 60 days I will watch no Netflix, no YouTube that is not educational, and no Video Games at all. Thank you all for inspiring me to be the best I can be in this life. \n\n                                   - Brendan",

            "selftext": "Hey all. Today marks day three of my no gaming lifestyle. It\u2019s been going mostly great so far: I\u2019ve been eating healthier and in less amounts, and I\u2019ve been going to the gym everyday now. I did binge watch a TV show yesterday which I\u2019m not proud of, but only because I was finishing it up so I can start a new show at a much slower and smarter pace. Anyways, despite all that (and starting some new books), I do still feel an emptiness. Gaming has always been a significant part of my life, and by putting that away my mind wants to start something else where it can dedicate a lot of time too while still being a healthy habit. So I\u2019d appreciate it if anybody could mention their favorite or recommended hobbies/activities. I\u2019m underage and don\u2019t have any close friends but do have a car, if you\u2019d like to consider those things.",

            "selftext": "Hi guys\n\nSo one of my biggest hobbies and things I do in my free time is gaming (with and without friends) and I mostly game online games like League of legends and Overwatch at the moment.\n\nThe thing is once I get into a game and know all the mechanics and stuff I start to take it too seriously and I just can barely enjoy it anymore because I am too hard on myself and I also really wanna win. So when it doesnt go well I just get pissed off and sometimes really angry. This leads to me being super tensed up in my chest for example and I occasionally get some heartburn even.\n\nI dont know why once I know almost everything about the game I'm playing, I just start to not enjoy it as much as when I was a noob. It was the same when I started playing heroes of the storm, it was super fun while I was learning. And now this time, with Overwatch, playing it and learning it was super fun.\n\nNow I know all the heroes abilities and stuff like that and I just barely enjoy it.\n\nIt sucks and I feel confused because I dont know what else to do and if someone asked me what I like to do I would say gaming among other things.\n\nMaybe I should stop gaming, but then I just have nothing to do, and I will also wanna game, because when I am not gaming I tend to forget that I dont really enjoy it once I play it.\n\nAny words of wisdom to me?\n\nAnything is greatly appreciated. Thanks guys",

            "selftext": "I posted here when I first stopped gaming, but I've deleted most of my post history so it no longer exists. My tl;dr story is that gaming played a part in ending my relationship (there were other issues, but I used gaming to run away from my problems instead of confronting and fixing them). I just wanted to post to update a bit and hold myself accountable.\n\nIt's been 2 months + 2 or 3 weeks of no gaming at all. I do often use social media/smart phones to waste time as well though, so there is still some tech dependence. I just deleted most of my social media apps and am going to start turning my cell data off when I'm not using the phone for directions or something else useful. I deleted the apps once before though and obviously it didn't last. Hoping this one sticks a little while longer. I only just realized turning off cellular data still allows you to send and receive calls and texts, so I think that added barrier of having to turn that on will help in making me realize I'm about to waste my time.\n\nAs for as gaming goes. I haven't had the urge to play at all until this week. It seems to coincide with my roommate starting to play some game that seems mildly interesting. I didn't have an urge to play that one, but been itching to want to play some games I've played in the past. \n\nI used to always be mostly a console gamer. Had a macbook air so there wasn't a lot I could play on that, but I have a newer, more expensive CPU I bought for programming that could definitely handle some games I would probably be interested in playing. I'm hoping that I can kick that itch, but we'll see what happens. Right now the main thing stopping me is I know I am far too busy to be using time playing a video game so there's no chance I'll let myself buy anything until my workload eases up.\n\nAnother thing I am only mildly worried about is my roommate has VR. It won't be set up for another couple weeks, but it's something I have yet to use and I will probably give it a go and like it quite a bit. I'm not overly worried about it though because there are 2 barriers to abusing this. 1) it's his system and I'd have to bug him to use it anytime I want to play it. And 2) it being VR I likely won't want to play it for prolonged periods of time (because motion sickness and activity, etc.) I do recognize though that this could lead to a problem down the road as VR is improved and becomes more common (I'm near certain that the next gen of consoles will come with VR out of the gate), so I shouldn't rely on it for a mild amount of gaming because it could grow to a problem again in the future. \n\nOverall kicking the addiction has gone pretty well for me, but I am nervous about my recent urges, which, as I said, I haven't had up until now.",

Who is going to tell a grieving child to stop doing the only thing that brings a smile to their face? Well, the years went by and I learned that if you show people you are happy, and keep up with responsibilities, they wouldn't ask about grief or gaming. I could play in secret as much as I wanted-- But I could never play enough.  \n\nWeekends, weeknights, early morning, skipping school and work: even while playing I felt dread at the need to take a break from gaming to take care of real life. \n\nI'm in my last week of college. I thought by this time I'd have my life figured out-- at least the next step. But for the last 19 days I've been playing upwards of 10 hours a day. Sleeping two, maybe three hours a night, sometimes with an afternoon nap. I'm ragged. These should have been a beautiful last few weeks with my college friends, but now I have one blurry memory of hundreds of hours sunk into a game. \n\nI think this is my fourth time quitting on r/stopgaming. It's the seventh or eighth time for me IRL. I can't do this alone. Thank you for reading.",

I read that games like chess, scrabble, sudoku etc. can be great brain exercise, develop problem solving, a bit creativity etc., just they are good exercises for our brains. I haven't time to learn techniques, tactics etc. etc. in chess that I wanted to started playing scrabble (physical, on board, not online, on computer etc.) and to solve sudoku, also physical, on paprer. I don't playing games, I stopped gaming time ago and I don't want to return to that, but I'm worried about playing scrabble and mentioned sudoku, are they enable, it's productive occupation, because of my dopamine levels and many others benefits that are stream from dropped gaming. Can I \"play\" them or these are also games, and I should avoid them? I \"playing\" scrabble with myself, I treat that as a brain exercise, what about if it'll become addjective for me, it's possible? Sometimes I feel some fun. Or sudoku?",

Your just projecting your feelings on a bit of coloured pixel, it's not very healthy. Getting caught in loops of saving the characters over ..and over...and over\n\n It's a bit different when it comes to books because you can stretch your imagination a bit, but at least you know with a book you are more grounded in reality.",

Well..let me explain before dismissing me outright.\n\nI'm 25 and have finally cut video games almost entirely out of my life. A life long addiction of 14 hours a day, destroyed relationships, missed opportunities, ect.. and its over.\n\nI had tried everything with no success from ages 20-25. Nothing worked until I made a hard rule for myself. \"If I game, it has to be VR\" and so I play roughly 6 hours a week of VR games. Most of that time is spent improving my driving skills with Sim Racing games. (simulated racing with a racing wheel, pedals, and shifter, games like Assetto Corsa, project cars, ect..)\n\nThis combo still lets me run my businesses, hit the gym 6 times a week, go to university, ect.. My life has never been better and my girlfriend agrees.\n\nIf it is financially feasiable, I feel like VR is a great weaning off tool for those trying to quit. It can be healthy, a more \"real\" hobby, and less time consuming.\n\nI have always had a hard time getting addicted to VR because of the energy it takes to set it up or just swing, jump around, ect.. even though I am pretty physically fit. \n\nIf it worked for me, then there must be something to it because I used to be bad off. I hated myself for this addiction and now I am cured.",

            "selftext": "I've been playing video games for a long time now, approximately for 20 years. I mainly played single player games and I honestly had a blast with some of them and really loved them for their stories, worlds and characters. These were like immersing myself in a great book or movie.\n\nI play less now that I'm a working adult but I still find myself playing more than I really should. I realized a few days ago that most of the time I'm not playing because the game really grips me and I find it to be of high quality and entertaining but because I got used to playing (there are a very few exceptions though). It's like playing is the default activity for me whenever I have free time and I have no urgent tasks. I find myself actively seeking the next \"thrill\", the next game to get lost in and usually end up with games I'm not really enjoying, they are mediocre and I just play because  it's relaxing, it's my hobby and \"what else could I do\"... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI decided that this needs to stop because otherwise it will go on forever, I can always find a game I didn't play so far or have already played and could replay again (and we are talking about \\~100 hour playthroughs). I uninstalled my \"filler\" games on my PC, and limited myself to 1 game at a time on my PS4 which I'm playing usually on weekends (not all day, just 1-3 hours) and maybe 1-2 hours weekdays, so finishing such a game takes weeks which I'm completely okay with. The rest of the time I spend with my girlfriend more actively than before, coding and working on a side project and also planning on starting going to the gym again. I have also changed the way I spend time with my friends. Unlike before I actively make the effort to meet them not only every 3-4 weeks during weekends but more regularly and also on weekdays as well and I can't believe why I didn't start socializing more before (I consider myself a social person)   \nAlthough I honestly don't consider myself an addict (sometimes I go days without playing and I don't actually miss it) I feel a lot better now and more in control of my life. My life and trying to make more out of it has literally became my new hobby.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my message to everyone who finds themselves actively seeking the next game to play and get really into: \n\nJust don't do it.  It will never end. Most of the time you'll not genuinely enjoy playing and will find yourself playing just for the sake of playing because \"that's your hobby\" and \"that's who you are\".  \nInstead just think about what else you could do which you'd also enjoy, make you better in some way and is real, and JUST DO IT.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck and all the best to everyone!",

I'm trying to reduce/stop my gaming time (not sure what would work best right now), but I have been struggling with other activities such as reading or watching something, as they don't reward me the same as a game would.

First thing he responds with is when you\u2019re going to \u201cplay overwatch with me?\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s the first time where I didn\u2019t crave it, my thoughts answered resoundly \u201cI\u2019m not\u201d. \n\nGaming does not feel like my identity anymore and it\u2019s power over me has massively subsided. \n\nLike if a friend invited me over and we played Beat Saber VR I\u2019d be totally cool with it and I know it wouldn\u2019t make me suddenly want to reinstall all the games and binge.\n\nI also want to point out that it\u2019s multiple things for me:\nNo Sugar (or very little - yogurt, occasional treats, occasional fruits) \nNoFap (no porn, masturbation, orgasm for 120+ days) \nNo gaming - whatever my counter says (though in reality I did semi-relapse for an hour or so on three different days- but it didn\u2019t make me binge - it made me realize how vain my addiction had been). \n\nExercise 3-5 times a week\nEating more protein &amp; fat than carbs (I\u2019m a big proponent that carbs are the enemy - we don\u2019t need it to survive- but we needs fats and protein)\n\nAlso I want to point out my life improved massively with all these changes but I also went to therapy every two-three  weeks and I was diagnosed with ADHD in 2016.\n\nI took Adderall for a bit but it had so many negative side affects I self medicated with coffee for a while. \nI\u2019ve since quit all caffeine since I get anxiety after 1 cup of coffee. \n\nHowever a two and a half weeks ago, I was started on 18 mg concerta and it\u2019s helped me a lot too.\n\nI\u2019m trying to comprehensively list everything so you can see where I\u2019m at and how I got here. It was no miracle, it was hard work and a new mindset. However, definitely the hardest was the first three months and I completely understand why both NoFap and StopGaming have 90 day challenges, as that\u2019s when you truly start becoming a new person.\n\nHappy to answer any questions you may have!",

I love the competition, the winning, the figuring things out, the cool events, reaching high ranks, new content, new patches, new expansions, etc.\n\nBut it all makes me feel so fucking terrible.\n\nStress, tension, anxiety, mood swings, sleep depervation, withdrawl from the real world, terrible hygine, eating poorly, spending tons of money on cosmetics and worthless garbage, etc, until I'm total brainwashed zombie that's absolutely useless to society.\n\nIt all fucking snowballs until I end up RIGHT BACK HERE - out of control and pissed off that I can't control it.\n\nHow does anybody do it? How can anybody do this as a hobby? How do people balance it? How does anybody that *truly loves this stuff* control their impulses? How do you focus solely on the real world for 90% of the day and then come home from work, play competitive games for a few hours and then go to bed without insomnia or the immense feeling of \"just one more game\"? How are you not thinking about new DOTA builds/strats at work, or slacking off watching Twitch when you're suppossed to be being productive? How is it possible to completely clear your mind of all your likes/addictions for part of the day and then dive right into them during your down time?\n\nIt's just not possible to turn it off. I've been doing this for the better part of the last 5 years. It's RUINING MY LIFE completely. I'll go on detoxes where I'll quit every type of game that involves other *real players* completely for a month or so, and my life will improve 5,000%. Everything improves. I am even able to literally get off all my anxiety meds and antideprescents EASILY. The withdrawl from not having gaming in my life is STRONG, but once I break through it(usually after 1 week of detox) I feel like a new human being. I sleep great, I eat amazing, my mind is always clear and focused on my job/friends/family, my social life is great, my relationships are great, I'm back in the gym 5 days a week, etc. It's mind-blowing.\n\nBUT THEN I eventually feel so amazing, I tell myself \"Hey, I bet you could handle it again this time!\", and I'll download something stupid like a Mobile Game, and in the beginning everything is fine and I'm able to balance gaming and real life easily. Then I'll eventually re-install something competitive like League or Overwatch or DOTA and *even that* will be fine for the first couple of weeks.\n\nBut then *eventually* the tides start to turn, and instead of spending a few hours a day playing or thinking about it, it will become more and more, until I have all my games back reinstalled into my library and I become a full-fledged addict again with insomnia, stomach pains, stress, anxiety, etc. Work will eventually become too hard to handle and I'll either quit completely or work less hours. It's the SAME SCRIPT every time. It's the SAME RESULTS every time.\n\nI don't want to quit for good, but it may be time. I just can't do it. I love this stuff more than life itself and I can't balance it. I feel like I'm a stupid moth attracted to a huge flame and even though I know this flame is going to kill me I still keep moving towards it.",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nThis post might be kind of long but here we go anyways. \n\nI\u2019m a 16 year old high school student, and I have a job as well as attending a school with very high standards of education. Last month, I found this subreddit, and last week, I took down my entire computer setup, because I wanted to focus more on my homework, my social life, and overall well-being. \n\nThe first few days went great, I started working out again, better sleep schedule, and just felt better overall. However, I found the weekend very difficult because that\u2019s where I have the most free time. I still made it though, thanks to a lengthy electronics project I resumed. This week however has been difficult. I\u2019ve found myself having nostalgia of random games I played when I was younger and just wishing to go back to it all. Summer vacation is also coming up fast so I\u2019m pretty nervous about that as well, and my computer just seems so lonely tucked away under my bed with the rest of my gear.\n\nI read the guide and I replaced the games with learning German, electronics, and some drawing. Should I sell my PC for good?",

            "selftext": "\\- \\[This post is part 4 of 4 of my attempt at an 'All-in-one guide to get motivated and quit gaming'\\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/bm9u2c/allinone\\_guide\\_to\\_get\\_motivated\\_and\\_quit\\_gaming/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/bm9u2c/allinone_guide_to_get_motivated_and_quit_gaming/))\n\n\\- Note this is a republished, renamed version of the 'Extended list of things to do when you stop gaming'. This was done so to go along with the other posts and as a whole in the guide above.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[Image\\]([https://bit.ly/2WDfAnz](https://bit.ly/2WDfAnz))\n\n\\- After you quit gaming, you'll need to find other things to fill your time with. But they don't just have to be 'hobbies', and especially not ones you desperately chose out of boredom;\n\n\\- Firstly, have you any areas of life that need fixing? Maybe your addiction interfered with your real life relationships, or you may have a sibling you didn't dedicate enough time to.\n\n\\- Gaming can be an escape, and a form of procrastination - were you putting something off for the temporary 'pleasure' of gaming? It's time to get back to it, fix it, finish it, to do it.\n\n\\- Maybe games interfered with your education or work? Now you've got the time, catch up on the revision, find a job, look for an apprenticeship - whatever, it may literally 'pay' off.\n\n\\- Look around you - see any clutter or mess in your room/home? Probably, and it's probably time to deal with it. Cleaning/decluttering will take time and effort, but should be worth it.\n\n\\- It'll clear the physical space in your home, but also the mental space in your mind. If you're quitting gaming for good, why not look for any tempting or guilt provoking leftover items?\n\n\\- Try improving your diet for long-term benefits and something to fill the time. Just because any convenient junk food is 'good' for the time being, side effects will set in over the years.\n\n\\- Alongside an improved diet, exercise is good too, especially if you're trying to lose weight. It again improves your physical and mental wellbeing, and both of these things will pay off.\n\n\\- No one is asking you to do 1000 pushups at the gym - start with a personal minimum or a goal. There are plenty of no-equipment exercises to do at home - or you can do running.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Health, relationships, environment and wellbeing are all great, but we like to balance work with a hobby; but finding one can be hard, especially if you never thought about it much.\n\n\\- Therefore, below I wrote a list of inspirational hobby ideas to help you if needed. I've tried keeping it real - you're not realistically going to climb a mountain the day you quit gaming;\n\n\\- There's a mix of indoor and outdoor activities, although depending on your interests and local area, many probably won't apply to you. Sometimes it's good to try something new.\n\n\\- It's also good to have a look at anything you did before gaming absorbed the time - maybe you have an old hobby to get back to, an unfinished project, or a skill to further develop.\n\n\\- In general, some people may find a routine planner useful. Remember, getting into a new lifestyle or routine is hard at first, especially if it's completely the opposite of the 'usual'.\n\n\\- Gaming could have more or less affected things like your concentration or willingness to do other activities, but if you keep trying, things will slowly but surely improve over time.\n\n\\- If you're worried you'll be overly bored after quitting gaming, it's also good to prepare and get an idea of the stuff you can do; at least for the time being - even through the planner.\n\n\\- Also try not to replace gaming with another (worse?) addiction e.g. gambling; or another useless way to waste time online, e.g. Youtube, surfing the web, social media overuse. So;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- You're ok to catch-up on a TV series or some movies, but try not to spend all your time in front of the TV instead of gaming. Use everything in moderation, especially technology.\n\n\\- Got a computer, maybe a good one left over from gaming? If you still prefer the digital world, you could try some design, animation or digital art, coding, or even blogging, etc.\n\n\\- Get social and active by joining (recreational) clubs or classes. Try the gym after a while, learn to swim, try yoga class, martial arts, and see any other general sports you may like.\n\n\\- If you can, why not travel and explore your local area or even the wider world? Or, you could learn a new language with free online courses such as Dualingo. It could help you.\n\n\\- Maybe you can go from online to traditional gaming? Card games, chess or scrabble are just some ideas of games you can play with friends or family on a rainy day or evening.\n\n\\- Although getting and instrument and any paid classes can be expensive, learning the guitar or keyboard could pay off and turn into a pleasant hobby (or even 'job', e.g. school bands).\n\n\\- Get stuck into a larger puzzle, and even hang up and display your finished masterpiece like a portrait. Knitting or sewing could also benefit you if you're into these types of things.\n\n\\- Who said LEGO is reserved for kids? There are plenty of creative adult collectors and builders - these little bricks are full of possibility, and bound to get your creative side going.\n\n\\- Talking of creative, art is another big thing to do - drawing, painting, doodling, colouring and so on. Or, you can catch up on a few books, go to a local library or listen to audio books.\n\n\\- Writing is a great thing to do if you're into this stuff, whether on paper or computer. You can also get a journal to write down your thoughts, and even try writing articles or blogging?\n\n\\- If you're into Do-It-Yourself, why not attempt a few (bigger) projects - and same goes for mechanics etc. It could even turn into something useful and beneficial for you/your home.\n\n\\- Or downsize to papercraft of varying type and complexity - try the art of origami, start doing holiday cards by hand, or make a 3D architecture model by folding paper/cardboard.\n\n\\- Get social and active, and explore your area - go for an urban exploration and see all there is to offer, such as the theatres, cinemas, and restaurants, or any landmarks in the area.\n\n\\- Photography is a great creative hobby and way to document the world around you. With some work on composition, lightning etc., you can make beautiful photos easily yourself.\n\n\\- Like the idea of the great outdoors? Try going further out to the rural and doing hiking, spending the hours fishing, and walking and cycling more in general to get out and about.\n\n\\- Or, go out closer to home - there's gardening, and anything other that needs doing around your home, running and exercises, or just relaxing or sunbathing, depending on the seasons.\n\n\\- Charity work and volunteering can be a way to pass time doing something beneficial - or even a part time job. And if you're tired after late game nights, why not just catch up sleep?\n\n\\- You can also see tutorials or classes on cooking if needed, or just go right into the kitchen, and make a healthy dinner, or chocolate dessert - even that will be homemade so healthier.\n\n\\- If you're nostalgic or just like exploring, you could visit a museum or see through the dusty attic. For more self-improvement and general benefits, you can practice meditation or yoga.\n\n\\- You can also see what your friends or family are up to for ideas; or if you're in school, see any extracurricular activities available; or check back at r/stopgaming for general inspiration.\n\n\\- Look online for other ideas and info, such as [www.quitlol.com](https://www.quitlol.com), and on [www.nosurf.org](https://www.nosurf.org) and [www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/wiki/activities](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/wiki/activities). NoSurf is similar to StopGaming but more general.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- If you know any helpful links to websites, ideas for hobbies or other information to add to this, please share with others in the comments; and I might update this post sometime as well.",

            "selftext": "\\- \\[This post is part 2 of 4 of my attempt at an 'All-in-one guide to get motivated and quit gaming'\\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/bm9u2c/allinone\\_guide\\_to\\_get\\_motivated\\_and\\_quit\\_gaming/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/bm9u2c/allinone_guide_to_get_motivated_and_quit_gaming/))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[Image\\]([https://bit.ly/2V4Trg8](https://bit.ly/2V4Trg8))\n\n\\- In many ways quitting is all about the realization. You should realize the problems associated with gaming, and the problems that led you into gaming/are keeping you away from quitting.\n\n\\- For many, gaming is an escape from life or relationship problems and responsibilities, which is understandable - but hiding from these unavoidable problems will do no good to help you.\n\n\\- Quitting gaming is a big step, but it should be done when things get out of control. It will require great self-discipline, but once you hit rock bottom you can 'restart the right way'.\n\n\\- Don't treat quitting games as restricting yourself. If you really want to quit, you'd have realized the downsides, and found gaming to be the restriction - from fixing life and chasing its benefits.\n\n\\- Gaming is ok in moderation, as I'll expand upon later, but when it consumes too much while giving back little, it becomes a problem. So to quit, here are some preparations to consider;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- The sunk cost fallacy often prevents quitting. You're chained to your progress/achievements, not wanting to let the hours played waste. That's understandable, and there are ways around.\n\n\\- You could just leave your games and accounts and just quit, but this seems far too simple, and usually ends up in being an easy temptation to come back, 'just for that one more game'.\n\n\\- One way to let go would be simply deleting your accounts - especially for the games you don't like or have made little progress in. But for the high-level accounts, this can be harder to do.\n\n\\- If you feel you aren't ready to fully let go of the progress, there are other ways to consider. You could preferrably uninstall the game, but leave the account and progress saved 'in case'.\n\n\\- You might take a few screenshots or record a clip of your best achievements. Or, give your 'pre-loved' account for someone else to use by replacing the account email to their one?\n\n\\- Then there are the gaming communities, like Discord or Reddit. These can fuel the need to compete, get rewards to show off and keep playing, or make you feel left out of the 'fun'.\n\n\\- The sensible thing to do is quit them. The main point of all this is to get rid of triggers.  But while gaming, many people end up having their main 'friends' online, in such communities.\n\n\\- You're ok to keep in touch with these people if you want to, as long as they can understand your choice to quit and can talk to you outside of gaming and without fueling the addiction.\n\n\\- You could add these people as friends on a single app, e.g. Discord, although be careful as this one's gamer-based. Just a way to keep in touch; although remember real life relations await.\n\n\\- You should also stop following any gaming-focused streams, websites, subreddits etc. about the games that you're planning on quitting anyway. You know you could use that time better.\n\n\\- Lastly, you could physically make the device you game on hard to access or set up. Unplug, hide or put it somewhere uncomfortable to reduce temptation to turn on and game so easily.\n\n\\- You can get someone, usually a relative, to help you. They could motivate and support you in general if they are willing to help you quit the unhealthy habit. Your relations could improve.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Whatever works for you, you'll eventually have to quit the habit of gaming. When you're feeling ready - or have had enough? - there are 2 main ways people have quit gaming. They are;\n\n\\- Firstly, you can go full-on cold turkey - one day just cut off gaming and try not to look back. The second method seems softer and involves gradually cutting back your time online.\n\n\\- Some people also game in-between periods of breaks, but this isn't really quitting, and can end up with them taking a longer break then coming back to full-on all day gaming sessions.\n\n\\- Gradually reducing game time can be good and less 'noticeable', but I think continuing to compete/progress at a game isn't necessary the way to quit, and requires much more discipline.\n\n\\- If you actually delete/prepare your accounts and games, then a cold turkey would be the way to take since you'd have gotten rid of many gaming triggers. But - are you prepared to change?",

            "selftext": "I have finally hit rock bottom in my life and its all thanks to video games. My identity has been wrapped up in being a gamer since I was 3 years old and after recently turning 29 Im starting to see the hobby that helped me through hard times for what it really is: the source of all of my problems. Thats the TLDR version. To give some context to how deep this problem runs, here's my life story that I irresponsibly stayed up all night typing on my phone:\n\nAlright... So I am addicted to gaming. I have no doubts about this. The problem, is that being a gamer is the only life I know and I have no idea what to do or how to change. My parents bought our first console: The Super Nintendo when I was an infant. From the time I could hold a controller at the age of 3 (in 1993), I was hooked. My earliest memories are of me watching my mom play Super Mario World and when I became obsessed with the movie Aladdin, she bought me the Aladdin game. That was the first video game I ever beat and I vividly remember finally beating snake Jafar because I was so excited I ran around the house screaming. That was the first time video games gave me that rush, and for the last 26 years I have been chasing that high.\n\nAll throughout my childhood and adolescence, I centered my identity around being a gamer and as I got older, my interests narrowed and narrowed. When I was 9 I had brain surgery to drain an arachnoid cyst. The procedure left me with ADHD, mild short term memory loss, and tourettes syndrome (tapping tick). The ADHD really made my gaming addiction infinitely harder to control. Hell, it's probably a contributing factor to why Im STILL addicted. It became the only way I could interface with other children and when kids started growing out of video games I was left behind on a social level. I became completely unable to hold a conversation that wasnt about video games. It was all I ever thought about. All the kids in the neighborhood that I used to play with started to grow out of Pokemon after Gold and Silver released and the thing I used to rely on to make friends started getting me ridiculed. I was subjected to endless name calling because I still played Pokemon despite Jr. High being right around the corner. I went from having a long list of friends I could call to play video games with to having almost no friends at all.\n\nWhen I was 14 I stopped playing the violin (despite being 4 years ahead of everyone in my class) and I eventually stopped baseball around the age of 16 because I tore my rotator cuff (causing my shoulder to dislocate any time I threw anything) which was the only thing I enjoyed besides gaming. This freed up all my spare time to just sit at home all day, because besides baseball and music, the only interest I had left was video games. This came at a time when online gaming was just starting to become mainstream. This was the end of my ability to pass classes. This was around the time I realized Im gay and started using my geeky personality to hide the fact I was obviously flamboyant and eccentric. I took this geeky persona to such lengths that I celebrated Winter-Een-Mas at school. Yes you read that right. I walked around high school wearing a burger king crown, a towel cape, and a controller scepter. Needless to say I was mocked. \n\nI was so addicted to gaming and my ADHD magnified it so much that I was lying to my teachers, parents, and psychologist about losing my homework. I would literally get home from school, run to my room and play Halo 2 until midnight, get to school the next day and feign ignorance about my homework to not have to deal with the consequences. I went from a B Average to a D average the second I joined World of Warcraft a few months before the Burning Crusade came out. I joined it because my best friend was holing himself up at home with his entire family to play it nonstop so I felt like I had to play it to keep my best friend. Turns out they were so addicted his parents stopped going to work and their house was forclosed on.\n\nMy social life in High School was god awful. Most of my friends were gamers as well, although their lives seemed to be a lot more balanced than my own. I was bullied a lot and was constantly getting suspended for beating up my bullies. I never minded suspensions because that just meant I now had an entire week of vacation to spend playing video games nonstop. I became emotionally dependent on video games to not have to process the pain I was experiencing from school and home. It was a bandaid that just made things worse.\n\nShit got even worse when I turned 16. Growing up, my gaming library was very limited. I maybe got 1 or 2 games a year. 3 if I was lucky. So I would just play those games to death. But the second I was able to get a part time job I applied at every single store at the mall with the intention of using any money I earned to expand my gaming library. So instead of having just Halo 2, Final Fantasy 9, Super Smash Bros, and Kingdom Hearts I went bananas buying everything I wanted. My first paycheck I bought a 360 and a whole bunch of games. Halo 3 became my new vice and I played it so often that I was level 50 in every ranked matchmaking, with the exception of Lone Wolves (I was 46). I was so obsessed with gaming I opted to go to a trade school for half of my high school days to learn 3D Animation. A program that was effectively a huge waste of my time and resulted in me being held back a grade because it caused me to have too many elective credits once they changed the graduation requirements half way through the program.\n\nEnter adulthood. I turned 18 right when the housing market crash and recession began. I did my last year of high school graduating at 19 with nothing new. I spent months looking for work, but nobody was hiring. I would spend all day riding around town applying for jobs on the bus, but nobody was hiring. I would get home and be scolded by my drunk abusive father for being a useless parasite who wasnt trying hard enough. I buried myself further and further into gaming because it was better than snapping and getting the cops called on me again for talking back and lashing out. I would play Rock Band on vocals because it felt good to sing the pain away. This is probably why the only non-gaming interest I currently have is karaoke.\n\nI finally found a job at a Valero gas station part time. From there I was rewarded with demands for more money than I was earning, despite my father earning six figures and not even needing it. I offered to pay 1/4 of the utilities and would buy my own groceries but that wasnt enough for him. My dad just absolutely despised that I was gay and hated having me live with him. This is at a time when the news was reporting that 3/4 people under the age of 30 were living with parents because entry level jobs disappeared. One night I came home super from working a double shift when the graveyard guy didnt come into work. I quietly sneak in and I go to get a glass of water before passing out. Thing is, I dropped the cup on accident and it woke my dad up. He stormed out of his room threatening to beat the shit out of me and when I told him I would defend myself, he said if I did he would have my mother lie to the police. She refused to lie and my dad moved out and left my mom over it. I still blame myself for my parents divorce.\n\nAfter a few months I moved in with this guy I had been dating all the way across town. He offered to let me live with him, knowing Id have to quit my job because he wanted to help me get out of that horrible situation with my parents. He didnt mind that I couldnt find work because he understood how bad the job market was and he had a lot of supplemental income as a software programmer for amex. He and I played World of Warcraft together for years and I would try to add value to the relationship by farming gold when I wasnt looking for work. I spent 6 hours a day job hunting and the rest playing World of Warcraft. I finally end up landing a job with Subway, but I fucked up my shoulder and had to quit when I had surgery. So it was back to being unemployed and playing world of warcraft. Once I got better I started looking for work, but my boyfriend stopped being sympathetic. He became abusive and started cheating on me, so I buried myself in WoW to null the pain. He eventually assaulted me and I left him the second I landed a new job.\n\nUpon leaving him after 5 years I realized something... I no longer had any friends. The only friends I did have moved out of state or refused to talk to me over petty drama that I wasnt a part of. Anyway, I resolved to go out and make new friends only to learn that I'm literally socially retarded from my years of gaming. I honestly wouldnt be surprised if Im autistic because in my first month of trying my hand at social events, I realized that I literally couldnt tell if people hated me or liked me. I made one friend, who really was just hanging out with me out of pity so he could help me learn what I was doing wrong. He and I would go to gay bars and he helped me work on my anxiety, and it worked for a time. People still thought I was weird, but not as weird as when I started. Sometimes mid conversation I would freeze like a deer in headlights because my anxiety would paralyze me. After enough exposure therapy I could finally go clubbing without having to run outside to breath every 15 minutes. My confidence was a little higher and I ended up landing a better job as a parts driver at a car dealership.\n\nAnd then I met the most wonderful man. Or at least I thought I did. He was a gamer and we would spend all our time together playing Pokemon and Yugioh and we eventually got hooked on Overwatch together. Things were great and I eventually landed a promotion that more than doubled my income. Thing was, he cheated on me several times. However, because my self esteem was so low because I was effectively socially retarded, I felt like I deserved it. I concealed my hurt by burying myself in video games again and in the course of this 3 year on again off again relationship I gained 100 pounds. My work suffered and I was let go as a result. The final straw being on december 1st of last year when I found his car parked at a bath house/sex club. I moved back in with my mom to take care of her because she had end stage COPD, but she died\u00a0 at hospice two weeks after my breakup just a week before Christmas. December shattered me.\n\nSince then I have been doing nothing but squatting in my mothers house doing nothing but playing video games and eating my way to an early grave for the last 5 months. And I have to admit... This is the lowest I have ever been. Im not happy with my life and I need to make drastic changes. I have no idea how to change or reverse the damage video games have done to my life. This shit has been my life, but it is destroying me and I have no idea what to do. How do I abandon the only identity I have ever had? How do I cast aside the one thing that has comforted me all my life? I feel so hopeless... Please help.",

            "selftext": "I've been a gamer for over 30 years. I'm 38, married, 1 child, and 1 more on the way in a few months. Like many people who post on this reddit page. I felt that I had a problem letting go. Now not so much. Mostly due to being busy raising a family, and working.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI used to get stressed that I wouldn't have time to play until my wife and and daughter are asleep. If I stayed up an extra hour or two, I would pay the price the next day for it for a lack of sleep. I've almost ruined the relationship with my wife when we were dating in 2007. At the time I was playing Final Fantasy XI: Online for 5 years. I made the choice the delete my account because I was obsessed with the game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter getting married and having our daughter, I knew the responsibilities I have, and yet I was stubborn to admit I have a problem. I would try and sneak in some time on single player games where I knew I can pause it in case something came up. Money and bills became an issue, but not from the gaming.\n\nI was working 2 jobs while my wife took care of our daughter and we were barely getting by. I left my city job and other job to work for USPS as a mail carrier. The plus side, more hours, and A LOT of overtime during the holidays. The negative side: the health insurance isn't very good. A normal work week is 8 am - 4:30 pm, 6 days a week. So you could work a lot of overtime, but that means you'll have less time after your shift till the next day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nComing home in the dark wasn't great because the day was over and my daughter 5 years old, would want to play. We take walks or go to the park depending on the weather. But I thought on a day of bad weather, I would let her play a few video games on my pc or xbox one. I honestly regret it. My wife warned me against it, and I wish I listened. My daughter and I would play Castle Crashers, and sometimes Goat Simulator. The one thing I refuse to let happen is the xbox be in her room. We keep it in the living room. And limit her play time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I thought I would try to get into live streaming on twitch as a second source of income. But due to being so busy at work, and then at home I decided to scrap that idea. Overtime I became less interested in gaming because I'm tired after getting home after a long day of work. 9 out of 10 times I choose to go to sleep instead of attempting to squeeze in time to game. Growing up, I used gaming as a way of escaping. I try not to live with regret, but I regret a majority of the time I spent gaming. The wasted time and guilt of it all, makes me feel like taking a long break till both my kids or in school, or just stop completely. The past few nights when I my wife and daughter were asleep. I was thinking about this: I need to not let the mistakes I made happen to my children. I love my wife, my daughter, my other daughter who isn't born yet. They are my world and I must protect them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you made it this far, thanks for reading.",

            "selftext": "Let's be honest: the act of playing too many video games is an addiction.\n\nThis is coming from a former gamer, and the impacts gaming had on my daily life were terrible.\n\nI am over 2 months out of it and don't want to ever go back.\n\nI played over 8+ hours a day of video games (mainly Rocket League). I started out waking up, going to class, coming home and playing until bedtime. Then I found myself staying up until 3 in the morning every night when I had 8 a.m.'s, which then resulted in me skipping some classes all together.\n\nI quit towards the end of the Spring semester, but unfortunately it already left an impact on my grades. I ended up failing Calculus, but no biggie! I will take it over the summer and pass! Other classes I didn't do so well in either. I became very depressed after quitting, but now I have a positive outlook on life.\n\nIf you are planning to quit, I recommend planning your future. You have to find something to fill the gap that was left. I took on tinkering and making stuff with implemented technology such as automated machines and smart devices.\n\nI struggled with, and think I am still struggling with wanting to go back. Thankfully, the Rocket League season just ended. But, I played alloootttt of Minecraft growing up, and a part of me wants to go back and play a little. But I will not, I'm stronger than my addiction.\n\nUnfortunately right now it seems it isn't any easier choosing not to go back and play. However I believe in time it will.\n\nI made this post to tell you there is a life beyond gaming. I wish you all the best in your journey to quitting the addiction.",

            "selftext": "I know that a million posts like this have already been made, and that mine won't offer too much extra info or advice to anyone, but I guess I want to still make it for my own sake. \n\nI am 22 years old and I have completely thrown my life away. Four years ago if you would have asked anyone what they thought my future would be like, they would likely say something along the lines of, \"hes got everything going for him and has a bright future ahead of him.\" Today this is no longer the case. I have a number of different issues I need to deal with but one of the primary ones I have had for some time now is an addiction to the internet, and more largely to gaming. I spend hours a day staring at a computer screen rather than doing anything to improve my life. I spent hundreds of dollars on virtual cosmetics and stat boosters just to make those hours in front of the computer screen more efficient. To make matters even worse I do this all regardless of the fact that I know my life is slowly falling apart and I need to stop. \n\nI lost the love of my life because she couldnt stand how I was incapable of pulling myself away from video games. I am 100 thousand dollars in debt with nothing to show for it because I am failing the classes that money went to, and even though I know I am failing I still couldn't resist going on to play more games. Quite frankly I already know its too late. I have a test in a day that I am no where near prepared for, with no chance at getting prepared for since I missed most of this semesters classes, and so I know I am going to fail. Once I do I wont be able to try and go back to finish my degree since my parents warned me that they will no longer help me with classes. Quite frankly even if I did, the degree I got coupled with the grades I have gotten over the last four years leaves me with literally no job options. So I will have 6 months to figure out how I am going to pay back 100k (closer to a quarter million stretched out with interest). My one final chance it the military, but there is a good chance they wont let me in for a medical reason. Therefore it looks like I am stuck trying to survive on a food runners job. The future is looking bleak to say the least. \n\nI guess one good thing that came out of this all is that I finally made it impossible to access most of my game accounts (by using throw away emails and random passwords) and am just waiting on the last one to be deleted now. To be honest my heart was pounding the whole time I was going through with this and I didnt know if I would be able to, but I did. I now feel a little like a junkie who is realizing that I just made it impossible to get my fix any more. I know this is good but I cant help but feel a little dizzy and sick. I only wish I had done it four years ago. Maybe then I would be graduating with honors and that same bright future still ahead of me. \n\nSo for anyone who chances upon this post, don't be like me. If you feel like you might have a problem with this addiction than you probably do. Take what ever measures you need to in order to beat it. Delete your accounts and make it impossible for you to ever game again. Do it fast without thinking and dont look back, I promise you will be a million times better off for it because you wont end up where I am now. \n\nIm gonna go sit in a shower now and think about all my life choices.",

            "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have always played games, from the age of 5 or 6. I started with Minecraft, which turned to Counter Strike since 2015. I have racked up 1376 hours in csgo, of which roughly 1000 are in-game. I am not proud of this number, as it is equal to about 1.5 school years. These are basically the only two games I have played for long time periods. I have clashed numerous times with my parents over the years, as I am a huge underachiever, coming from the combination of procrastination and video games (mainly just CSGO). I'm not too dumb, so I can keep up with school work easily, but video games and procrastination stop me from being anything above average.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRight now, I don't see gaming as too big of an issue, but upon accidentally finding this sub, I have realised this needs to stop before it gets to the stages I have read about from other people. From what is often discussed, I noticed that the question is always: Does this give you joy **and** value? and thinking about it, this is not the case for CSGO. I get bored, but play out of the obligation to prove myself to others by ranking up. Most games, I realise that I'm not actually enjoying myself. I am 16, and start Sixth Form (last two years of school, v. important) this September. I want to finish High School (that's what it's called i think?) with very good scores, and want to study at a reputable university. I have the goals, and should have the motivation. However, I have 3 questions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) Procrastination doesn't magically improve when I stop playing games. What works for you?\n\n2) I still play Minecraft with friends from time to time. I really enjoy this. However, does it help to just go cold turkey and stop all games?\n\n3) Should I stop watching videos and streams? I enjoy these from many different games, but this probably doesn't help me, right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for giving me inspiration, my goal is to start with 100 days of no games. I will post an update, to see how it's going, if anyone is interested.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you guys,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nvice",

            "selftext": " \n\nI think this is something that belongs on [r/offmychest](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest) but I still need some guidance on what to do in my situation. If anyone could offer guidance in the comments or wants to talk to me on Discord I'd be happy to.\n\nI'm sorry for my long post I'll include a TLDR at the end of it.\n\nEver since I was 5 years old, I got my first gaming console - a Wii.\n\nI still have my Wii. I loved it back then and I still love it. I was a happy child at 5 years old, like extremely happy. I loved playing on my Wii as well. School was going great. Life was awesome. Essentially my point here is that at this stage in my life, I was only a child and video games never had a detrimental effect on me.\n\nI continued to play on my Wii until I was around 9-10 years old, this is when I got my first PS3. I started to play games such as Skyrim and Infamous. Everything in life was still going great but I remember that I used to have many nights where I'd play hours on end (like 8+ hours) with minimal breaks. This is where the addiction started to take place. Now here, even though my addiction began I was still very contempt with my life, still happy.\n\nWhen I was 11, I made a deal with one of my gamer friend: we both enjoyed playing different games and we decided that I would try his game and he would try mine. The game I had him try is irrelevant since he never got into it. The game he had me try was League of Legends. This was really a breaking point in my life.\n\nI really enjoyed this game. So did my friend. I began to play hourlessly with my League of Legends friend group: I'd come home from school to play this game from 3:30-8 o'clock doing barely anything else. This is also where I started to view porn. I progressively began to become a worse and worse student, I let video games become the center of my life.\n\nI felt video games and porn were used to cover up the fact that I've been lonely since that point in my life. All the original friends that I used to play league with quit. I hardly have any friends that I stay in touch with regularly.\n\nI don't know what else to say. Every since 11 years old I've been addicted to the game League of Legends and I've had a porn addiction:\n\n\\- My work ethic is significantly worse regarding to my academic life\n\n\\- Even though my work ethic is worse than it used to be in grade school, I still manage to maintain a high average due to my naturally good memory\n\n\\- My dopamine reward system is fucked up\n\n\\- I hardly spend any time with family and have drifted away from friends\n\n\\- I'm depressed and borderline suicidal: I lack purpose\n\n\\- I have poor friend groups - my main one at the moment consists of very unmotivated people who are similar to me, they also have horrible work ethic\n\n\\- I sit in my room all day, every day when I come home from school\n\n\\- I feel extremely isolated, I am stressed and anxious\n\n\\- I don't have a mentor to look up to in life or anyone to guide me\n\n\\- I have a shit diet, I don't eat much and when I do it's the same constant foods. I don't have that much physical exercise, I struggle to run and do physical exertion\n\n\\- I have many insecures especially regarding my physical appearance which has constantly been made fun of my entire life through passive-aggressive comments\n\n\\- I hate living in my house completely: my dad is constantly stressed out since he has to take care of my autistic brother and my grandma who has mental issues. My mom constantly nags at me. There is a lot of yelling in my house. I wouldn't consider myself 'abused' though. I am 15 and I plan to move out once I reach University where I will then have to be self-sufficient. I don't like my household.\n\nI've been trying to battle my addiction for the past two months but it's been really hard. It's really fluctuated in terms of my video game amount. Since I have a great memory I am able to have a lot of free time, so I've tried to enroll in different activities:\n\n\\- Kung Fu 3 times a week for 1hr (kung fu is a martial art)\n\n\\- Guitar for 30mins a week - I will increase it to 1 hour a week starting this or next week\n\n\\- I am taking a lifeguarding course which is 1 time a week for 3hrs\n\nI am struggling in these extracurricular: I am unmotivated. I constantly make excuses in order to not go to Kung Fu. I do not practice Guitar for 15-30 minutes like my teacher recommends, I usually practice like 1-2 a week for this amount or less. I am hardly passing my lifeguarding course since my endurance is horrible and am not striving to improve.\n\nMy porn addiction has always remained.\n\nMy plan to fix everything:\n\nThe two methods to overcoming addiction which I have heard of are slowly progressively disengaging in the addiction and going cold turkey.\n\nCold turkey works better for me. I am planning to quit video games and pornography as a whole.\n\nI plan to fix these extracurricular by:\n\n\\- Going to Kung Fu from now on\n\n\\- Practice Guitar every day for 20 minutes\n\n\\- Practicing my Swimming endurance by going to the pool every weekend on Sundays and swimming\n\nI understand that even if I do these things I will have free time, an excessive amount. I will enroll in Jiu Jitsu (Martial Art) and learn Chinese once I have managed to fix these extracurriculars.\n\nI'm sorry this whole post is just a rant. I honestly expect downvotes. I'm stressed writing this out and my life is a mess. I really need guidance. Am I doing the right thing? What do you recommend I do?\n\nPlease comment any info you need in the comment section. Apologies for grammar/spelling mistakes.\n\nTLDR; I am addicted to video games and porn which has caused my life to go downhill. I have an unhealthy dopamine reward system causing me to lose motivation. My academic performance has reflected this. I am attempting extracurriclars but am lacking motivation. I am planning to quit video games and porn cold turkey. Looking for guidance.",

I am thinking about gaming for that single night once a week.\n\nI think playing one video game at a time will also help.  Sometimes I switch up video games when I get tired of one.  But if I only play one and get the desire to play something else, then I will just stop playing completely instead.  I have a vast amount of video games on my hard drive, but if I only have one installed i think it may be easier to moderate and control.\n\nThoughts on playing just one video game at a time one day a week?",

            "selftext": "For me, gaming used to be extremely important and i would play any game with utmost dedication. I took games very serious and i would spend a lot of time and effort to make sure i was playing at my best, that i was playing in the most efficient and correct way possible. I aimed for the best time, accuracy, and so much more. I aimed for the top, whether it was a single player or a multiplayer or even mmo.\n\nAny new game consumed me and i had to learn as fast as possible how to play it and how to beat it, which has become a more and more complex task now with the newer games (or mmos). Any hardcore gamer will know that to be good at a game you actually need a lot of knowledge of the game which usually involves spending a lot of time on it's wiki page, spending a lot of time on forums, watching others play.\n\nSo that's what i've been doing for almost 20 years so far. I'm now 31 yo and i managed to ignore all of my life's failures by getting more successful as video games.\n\nThe worse my real life was going, the worse my future was looking, the more I played video games and the bigger my desire to be the top/the best was. \n\nThe thing with gaming is that it just gives you the feeling you HAVE IT. Whether it is virtual money and amassing more, items, properties, fame, skill etc. You get the reward you need, even if it's an illusion. Your brain can't tell the difference, it just gets it's need met. \n\nSo many times I read about \"gamers lacking motivation\" as if it was a \"bad\" side-effect of gaming, but that's just not true at all. It's just a natural consequence of your brain getting satisfied. It's obviously bad, but it's also 100% logical. You get anything you need and more from games, there is no reason whatsoever to put in any effort in life to get it.",

I'm 17 and have a whole life to live so I'm thankful that I'm giving it up now, before I got deeper into it. For the past couple years I've been playing in amateur leagues for R6S and other competitive shooters. I THOUGHT that I wanted to go pro in something because who wouldn't love to play video games all day...turns out *I* wouldn't. Games made me toxic and angry, and I never got off in a good mood.

            "selftext": "Short backstory: I've been thinking about stopping gaming for a while now, probably good 2 years. I am going through on and off stages, where I don't touch my gaming pc for few weeks and then spend whole weekend on it. I've been wanting to make changes to my life, I am not very social, spend my weekends indoors, even though I love being outside. I try to get out and go for a walk, but as soon as I get back and no one is home my first instinct is to play games. I played Battlefield 1 for 4 hours yesterday, I was doing well, mostly in top 10, couple of times in top 3, and got some achievements, however as soon as I stopped, none of it mattered. Nothing in my real life changed, I haven't gained any valuable knowledge or skills, didn't even feel relaxed, if anything I was more frustrated and tired than before.\n\nI didn't realise that I had a problem with games, that they are my escape until I thought about stopping completely. I felt anxious, my heart started to race, I felt like I was about to have some sort of panic attack over something that doesn't contribute to my well being. Yet, it is hard to let go of them. I am not blaming gaming as source of my problems, however I do feel like they are making easier for me to procrastinate.\n\nSo today I am finally going to break free. I have a Windows PC dedicated to just games and a Mac for everything else. Problem is my PC is always ready to play whenever I want, which doesn't help with stopping. I thought about selling it, but it's at the age where I wouldn't get a lot for it, so I prefer to keep it. \nHowever, for a while I've been wanting to get back into Linux, and I think this will be a good chance to do both, stop gaming and get back into it. \nI've been wanting to learn more about Docker, Kubernetes, AWS and other new technologies to advance my IT career, but I never got around to do any of it, because gaming was the easier way out.\n\nI am about to install Manajaro KDE on my gaming PC and I know gaming on a Linux is a thing, however having Linux OS as daily driver will hopefully push me into more interesting projects rather than gaming.\n\nHopefully this will help me break other bad habits and  swap time spending on getting achievements in games for getting achievements in real life.\n\nWish me luck!",

            "selftext": "(Note:) This is Part 4 of my attempt to put everything on stopping gaming in one guide; [reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/bm9u2c/allinone\\_guide\\_to\\_get\\_motivated\\_and\\_quit\\_gaming](https://reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/bm9u2c/allinone_guide_to_get_motivated_and_quit_gaming)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- After you quit gaming, you'll need to find other things to fill your time with. But they don't just have to be 'hobbies', and especially not ones you desperately chose out of boredom;\n\n\\- Firstly, have you any areas of life that need fixing? Maybe your addiction interfered with your real life relationships, or you may have a sibling you didn't dedicate enough time to.\n\n\\- Gaming can be an escape, and a form of procrastination - were you putting something off for the temporary 'pleasure' of gaming? It's time to get back to it, fix it, finish it, to do it.\n\n\\- Maybe games interfered with your education or work? Now you've got the time, catch up on the revision, find a job, look for an apprenticeship - whatever, it may literally 'pay' off.\n\n\\- Look around you - see any clutter or mess in your room/home? Probably, and it's probably time to deal with it. Cleaning/decluttering will take time and effort, but should be worth it.\n\n\\- It'll clear the physical space in your home, but also the mental space in your mind. If you're quitting gaming for good, why not look for any tempting or guilt provoking leftover items?\n\n\\- Try improving your diet for long-term benefits and something to fill the time. Just because any convenient junk food is 'good' for the time being, side effects will set in over the years.\n\n\\- Alongside an improved diet, exercise is good too, especially if you're trying to lose weight. It again improves your physical and mental wellbeing, and both of these things will pay off.\n\n\\- No one is asking you to do 1000 pushups at the gym - start with a personal minimum or a goal. There are plenty of no-equipment exercises to do at home - or you can do running.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Health, relationships, environment and wellbeing are all great, but we like to balance work with a hobby; but finding one can be hard, especially if you never thought about it much.\n\n\\- Therefore, below I wrote a list of inspirational hobby ideas to help you if needed. I've tried keeping it real - you're not realistically going to climb a mountain the day you quit gaming;\n\n\\- There's a mix of indoor and outdoor activities, although depending on your interests and local area, many probably won't apply to you. Sometimes it's good to try something new.\n\n\\- It's also good to have a look at anything you did before gaming absorbed the time - maybe you have an old hobby to get back to, an unfinished project, or a skill to further develop.\n\n\\- In general, some people may find a routine planner useful. Remember, getting into a new lifestyle or routine is hard at first, especially if it's completely the opposite of the 'usual'.\n\n\\- Gaming could have more or less affected things like your concentration or willingness to do other activities, but if you keep trying, things will slowly but surely improve over time.\n\n\\- If you're worried you'll be overly bored after quitting gaming, it's also good to prepare and get an idea of the stuff you can do; at least for the time being - even through the planner.\n\n\\- Also try not to replace gaming with another (worse?) addiction e.g. gambling; or another useless way to waste time online, e.g. Youtube, surfing the web, social media overuse. So;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- You're ok to catch-up on a TV series or some movies, but try not to spend all your time in front of the TV instead of gaming. Use everything in moderation, especially technology.\n\n\\- Got a computer, maybe a good one left over from gaming? If you still prefer the digital world, you could try some design, animation or digital art, coding, or even blogging, etc.\n\n\\- Get social and active by joining (recreational) clubs or classes. Try the gym after a while, learn to swim, try yoga class, martial arts, and see any other general sports you may like.\n\n\\- If you can, why not travel and explore your local area or even the wider world? Or, you could learn a new language with free online courses such as Dualingo. It could help you.\n\n\\- Maybe you can go from online to traditional gaming? Card games, chess or scrabble are just some ideas of games you can play with friends or family on a rainy day or evening.\n\n\\- Although getting and instrument and any paid classes can be expensive, learning the guitar or keyboard could pay off and turn into a pleasant hobby (or even 'job', e.g. school bands).\n\n\\- Get stuck into a larger puzzle, and even hang up and display your finished masterpiece like a portrait. Knitting or sewing could also benefit you if you're into these types of things.\n\n\\- Who said LEGO is reserved for kids? There are plenty of creative adult collectors and builders - these little bricks are full of possibility, and bound to get your creative side going.\n\n\\- Talking of creative, art is another big thing to do - drawing, painting, doodling, colouring and so on. Or, you can catch up on a few books, go to a local library or listen to audio books.\n\n\\- Writing is a great thing to do if you're into this stuff, whether on paper or computer. You can also get a journal to write down your thoughts, and even try writing articles or blogging?\n\n\\- If you're into Do-It-Yourself, why not attempt a few (bigger) projects - and same goes for mechanics etc. It could even turn into something useful and beneficial for you/your home.\n\n\\- Or downsize to papercraft of varying type and complexity - try the art of origami, start doing holiday cards by hand, or make a 3D architecture model by folding paper/cardboard.\n\n\\- Get social and active, and explore your area - go for an urban exploration and see all there is to offer, such as the theatres, cinemas, and restaurants, or any landmarks in the area.\n\n\\- Photography is a great creative hobby and way to document the world around you. With some work on composition, lightning etc., you can make beautiful photos easily yourself.\n\n\\- Like the idea of the great outdoors? Try going further out to the rural and doing hiking, spending the hours fishing, and walking and cycling more in general to get out and about.\n\n\\- Or, go out closer to home - there's gardening, and anything other that needs doing around your home, running and exercises, or just relaxing or sunbathing, depending on the seasons.\n\n\\- Charity work and volunteering can be a way to pass time doing something beneficial - or even a part time job. And if you're tired after late game nights, why not just catch up sleep?\n\n\\- You can also see tutorials or classes on cooking if needed, or just go right into the kitchen, and make a healthy dinner, or chocolate dessert - even that will be homemade so healthier.\n\n\\- If you're nostalgic or just like exploring, you could visit a museum or see through the dusty attic. For more self-improvement and general benefits, you can practice meditation or yoga.\n\n\\- You can also see what your friends or family are up to for ideas; or if you're in school, see any extracurricular activities available; or check back at r/stopgaming for general inspiration.\n\n\\- Look online for other ideas and info, such as [www.quitlol.com](https://www.quitlol.com), and on [www.nosurf.org](https://www.nosurf.org) and [www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/wiki/activities](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/wiki/activities). NoSurf is similar to StopGaming but more general.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Please share any thoughts or ideas for improvement, or criticize anything, as I'm no certified expert here.

            "selftext": "I had been a competitive gamer for 13 years. Since the beginning, I always thought online gaming was great because when I first started I met a lot of awesome people, some of whom I still talk to today. After a few years, I got very invested in the competitive side and wanted to become a professional gamer. At that time pro gamers barely made any money, but I loved the thrill and got a high after winning an intense match. I got fired from a couple of jobs and dropped out of college to pursue this dream, but what I didn't realize was that I was using it as an escape. Online gaming was drawing me away from the real world and into a world of isolation and loneliness. While I appreciate and value the friendships I have made online, they were not quality friendships. I went through several competitive games over the years and was highly ranked within each game which gave me a false sense of confidence. My dream to become a pro gamer eventually faded but my addiction to gaming didn't. As I finished college (finally) and got promoted at work (miraculously), I realized more and more that gaming was holding me back from my full potential. Once I quit 3 months ago, I felt like I could see clearly for the first time in 13 years. My flaws became evident as I was no longer occupying my mind constantly. It was very hard at first. I couldn't find things to do. I was bored. I had very bad anxiety from the loneliness caused from being isolated for so long. I didn't have gaming to comfort me or distract me anymore. So, I started working out, going for walks, journaling, meditating, talking to people, and going out on dates. I filled my time with activities that I knew would benefit me in my quest for change. After a month I met a girl and we really clicked. This fueled me even more to continue breaking out of my shell and going outside my comfort zone. After awhile I realized that I don't even want to play video games anymore because I realize how much of a waste of time they are. I would rather use my time to get real life achievements rather than in-game ones. I have been with the same girl for 2 months now and I no longer feel lonely or as anxious. I still have trouble being around people but it is getting better. 3 months ago there was mold growing on the dishes in the sink because I just didn't care, today my apartment is much cleaner. I just wanted to share my story for anyone out there that was sucked into gaming for as long as I was, you can get better if you put your mind to it. If you put as much energy into real life as you put into gaming then you can achieve anything you want. If anyone wants to message me to talk then feel free. It can be very confusing after quitting so it is nice to have a community to talk to. Thanks to this community and thanks for reading.",

            "selftext": "Currently 21yo, I've been gaming ever since being handed a PS2 controller and playing Dark Cloud back in 2001 (what a classic ;) ). In high school this became a problem where MMO addiction, while not to the extent of skipping school, resulted in me getting below average grades even on a repeat final year (I'd historically done well in school).\n\nMy parents have always been somewhat passive to my laziness. This is partly as during my teenage years I self-studied Japanese and passed my JLPT N2 and took a few self-funded trips through part time work earnings. However don't take this the wrong way, it took me years to get to that point, a point I should have reached years earlier - I started at 13 so it's already been 8 years and my commitment to study these days is dwindling more than ever despite the fact I do want to improve further.\n\nI've talked with my friends once since finishing high school. If I'm not at work, I'm gaming with my online friends - I'm very good at avoiding social events where I can. Today I woke up at 9am and spent 13 hours gaming and I just cringe at how empty my life feels at the end of the day.\n\nIn the past I wanted to be an artist, then I also got really into 3D art and programming. I've dabbled in all of the above over the years although never to a committed level. Once upon a time I dreamed of owning a game company but reading the posts on here also gives me moral conflict, are games wrong? Is the thing I want to spend my time on just ultimately a time/life drain for others? Am I denying them happiness, or taking another poor soul down the path of addiction. I wouldn't feel proud dedicating my time towards that.\n\nI feel like I should be so much further on in life than I am, that I could be so much more If I didn't waste around 50+ hours a week gaming/online.\n\nWhat are everyone's thoughts around the morality of creating games? Is the onus on the individual or the creator? or both?\n\n\nAlso what recommendations do people have for less game time, more study time. Unplugging altogether is a challenge for me as game creation is quite an aligned space.",

            "selftext": "Some of the things I would change would be go back to the original roots of video games. And what do I mean by that I mean have game complete and that it. NO side quest, No online multiplayer, no collectibles, no in game purchases, no early access, no more dlc it just the game and completion.\n\nThe second thing I would change is instead of saying Game over, I would say the end. There reason behind this when you die in video game or complete a video game you see the word game over which in reality triggers you like you might have failed and you keep playing to the next game because game over means we failed the game even though we completed the game therefore causing the addiction to continue. This why if you read The end instead of game over you know the game has ended and you don't feel obligated to get the next game in the series.\n\nNow what I would do is make video game that is designed to collect things only to complete the game nothing more nothing less, because over the years the dlc and collectibles have increased drastically, This would have no online function and complete single player game but only get the tools you need to complete the game then once your done, you say the end. e therefore causing the addiction to continue. This why if you read The end instead of game over you know the game has ended and you don't feel obligated to get the next game in the series.\n\nI would use the same method to complete the game that it. I know games are fun and all I do know this stopgaming but I would like to hear your thoughts on this matter and how would you improve the indursty to make less addictive in the comments below?",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone. I'm utterly new to this sub, almost at least, and I wanted to introduce myself with something I've been seeing more clearly about myself recently.\n\nI really didn't think I had a problem with gaming until a little while ago, when I found myself playing a game without even enjoying it and started thinking how odd it was that I was doing that. And how familiar.\n\nIf you've been over on nosurf, you might already know me from there. I was a serious social media addict the last few years and have gotten much better since about last summer. Looking at my social media addiction, I could identify a component I also recognized in my gaming behaviour recently: That the behaviour became kind of automatic. A mindless, mechanic distraction; my go-to activity for the evenings.\n\nI started thinking how that has been the case almost all my life. I played my first videogame at 4 years old and have never really not played games. As a child I was already glued to screens quite often, as I was as a teenager, these times of heightened consumption obviously always interspersed with times where I was otherwise occupied. But the times when I was more consistently not playing videogames or consuming content on screens were sparse, and I know that there was an episode in my teens where I lost contact with some of my best friends over wanting to do nothing but play MMOs on Steam whenever school was over. Heck, there was almost an entire year after I completed my finals where I had very little contact with people IRL and would spend most of my week online on Steam. Not on games, but still online.\n\nNow, I try to be mindful of my tech consumption and I have managed to dial it down quite a lot, but recently I've been feeling very stressed about various aspects of my life again and started noticing how I'm tempted to withdraw into games again. The difference, however, being that now, I realize what I'm doing in trying to escape, and how unsatisfying it really is. And yet there I was again, just a few weeks ago, playing, all the while wondering why I was even still doing this.\n\nThe thing is, I realized at this point, that I don't really know how life without videogames (or generally using tech for distraction) feels and I'm super tempted to try it, but also afraid of not finding ways of dealing with the feelings, crises, conflicts etc. I will most likely be experiencing if I do. It is already hard to realize that I have spent most of my life distracted by and dependent on technology.",

            "selftext": "This is probably the weirdest question I've ever asked, but I need ideas and experiences. I mean, sure, we all think about things that happen in our lives and most of us probably have some escapist fantasies, but there're times when you mind moves to its background comfy mode - when you do physical work, do cleaning, washing, stuff like that. Or maybe when you're stuck in a queue or at a very boring meeting. There's not much to think about in what you're doing, you can't mentally work on anything serious, you don't want self-reflection, cause you'll lose physical focus, but human brain can't be vacant either.\n\nFor a longest time in these moments my mind has been moving on to think about gamings. I would think about the current game, my gaming plans, the upcoming games, people and topics from gaming sites that I read. It's prehaps the biggest impact of gaming on me atm. So I need to get rid of it. And I don't know how to think differently. I mean if I don't muse on games - do I actually think about solving my irl problems all the time? do I replace gaming with another hobby? How does it happen for people who are not gaming addicts?..",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone!\n\nA few days ago I made a post about how quitting gaming was only getting more difficult as the days went on. I checked my counter and I'm currently on Day 39 for context. I'm now somewhat realizing my problem, and the real reason I quit, and it's not necessarily gaming related, though games definitely were part of it.\n\nBefore attempting quitting this time around I made a paragraph to myself to read if I ever wanted to relapse, and frankly I have wanted to do that on several occasions thus far, and I've read it multiple times. This is what it said:\n\n\nThese have essentially become the sole focus of your life. They have become the default activity to turn to when you\u2019re bored. You spend so much time on them, and you can\u2019t stop thinking about them. You now no longer enjoy other activities because of the fact that you\u2019re so fixated on gaming. You have no creative outlets, and when you do relapse, the ones that you have go away. It\u2019s also a massive timesuck. And playing them for hours at a time makes you feel depressed and sometimes suicidal. If you relapse, yes, it will take the edge off, but only for a short time. Then the depression kicks in and you\u2019re back to wanting to quit again. You\u2019ve tried moderation, multiple times in fact, but it has never worked. When you\u2019re on them you just want more. They fuck up your reward system, and the only way to fix that is by quitting.\n\n\nLooking back on this paragraph, it is clear I had a very strong reason to quit, that being that I wasn't happy with gaming, yet I would do it anyway. I assumed this was just me being addicted, and it very well could have been part of it, but a new problem has arisen.\n\nI decided to go back to my old hobby of conlanging as soon as I quit, which seemed like a fun idea. And, for the record, it was. I ended up being totally enthralled in it for the first three weeks or so. I loved every second of it. But now the joy is gone. The problem is, I don't know what to do, so I just conlang more since I have to pass the time somehow.\n\n\nThis is likely why being off gaming is so soul destroying now for me, at least from personal observation. I immediately fixate completely on something else, and just default to it, even when it's not enjoyable. I also did this when I tried to quit gaming about a year ago, except with trombone playing. I played so much that extremely painful zits formed on my lips and I would get nosebleeds from playing high notes.\n\nMy question is, how do I stop this behavior where I default to things even when I don't enjoy them?\n\nAt this point, my view is I'm going to continue abstaining from gaming, until I have this defaulting behavior under control, at which point I'll add them back into my life.",

            "selftext": "Hello!\n\nIm a 23 year old man who've spent most of my teenage years playing computer games. At times, gaming was the only thing I could put my mind to. I have felt the frustration of wanting to quit, but not knowing what to do instead. I have felt the emptiness of spending days and weeks grinding online, without really developing anything in real life. \n\nAbout one year ago, things started to change. I got into a serious relationship, started a business and am now getting married in two months. Now, I can finally say gaming is no longer is an issue in my life, but I know it is for many others. \n\nOne of my biggest frustrations were that nobody really understood me. My parents wanted me to quit, but they had no idea what I could spend my time doing instead. To me, gaming seemed to be the only entertainment in the world. I was sick of all the guidance from people who had no clue - gaming wasn't an issue when they grew up.\n\nWhat I want to do is write a book to people who struggle with gaming addiction. I'm not sure whether I should focus on people who want to quit, or inspire gamers in general to consider quitting.\n\nI would love to hear any input you might have on this case. Below you'll find a few questions that my mind is currently pondering.\n\nNOTE: I'm not gonna say gaming is ONLY bad. I mean, it can be great entertainment! I just want to let people know there is more to life than a virtual world online. \n\ntldr: I want to write a book to help teenagers understand there is a better option than gaming all day. Then, maybe they won't have to waste 10 years like I did. To do that, I need your input.\n\n\nQUESTIONS \n\n- I understand that a 13 year old wants to play all day. I mean, why not? Its fun, stress free and your brain has a dopamine party. How do you tell teenagers there is a better option, without sounding like a clueless parent?\n\n- Do you have ideas for important topics?\n\n- What should I avoid saying?\n\n\nThank you for reading this far!",

            "selftext": "I'm a social guy. Or at least I was. I actually enjoy talking with people and having friends. I used to have a lot of friends. Until I got obsessed with games.\n\nIn November 2014, I bought CS:GO on Steam. I played a lot. By the end of the summer, I almost had 1000 hours. I could have had a lot more, but I had school which back in the day, I hated because it kept me from playing the game. \n\nMy friends always called me and asked me if I want to hang out, but I always found an excuse or told them the truth (that I'm playing and I don't want to go outside). So they moved on, found new friends, and now won't even talk to me. \n\nIn the 8th grade I had to take an important exam that decided your future high school. My mom always told me that I need to study more, and I always told her that I have enough time. I hadn't had enough time, so my grade wasn't high enough for the high school. I ended up in a bad high school, where I couldn't make new friends. I wish I could rewind the past 2 years and take that exam again, knowing how important would actually end up being.\n\nEven now, I preferred playing video games instead of learning for tests, so I can move to the high school of my dreams. I even failed math last year and had to take a summer exam to promote the class (which I did, thankfully).\n\nSo now, I want to change. My goals are to learn more to move to a better high school, reconnect with my old friends (if possible) or find new ones, find a girlfriend (which I never had because of games), go to gym more than I do now (instead of 3 times a week, everyday), learn how to actually socialize again (since in the past few years I only socialized with people I already knew and with online \"friends\") and most important, NEVER PLAY VIDEO GAMES AGAIN IN MY LIFE.\n\nWish my luck. I'll come back in a few months with an update to let you know If I did it or if I failed and started playing again.",

As a third step, people may benefit from installing a program like K9 Web Protection or OpenDNS in order to block any blizzard domain that may be carelessly visited in times of withdrawal, to prevent reinstallation. There are also desktop programs you can use to block the use of programs. I personally use FocusMe, which allows you to set specific limits on which programs you can even open.\n\n**Concept 2: Not so \u2018Social\u2019**\n\nI think this is very important. The thing that has kept me tied to gaming for so long hasn\u2019t been the games themselves, but the social aspects. I have made online \u2018friends\u2019 and have \u2018social\u2019 interactions with them on a daily basis. The reason I put these in quotes is not because I don\u2019t like these people, but I don\u2019t think the relationships are organic or genuine. They are usually based on someone I work well with to compete at a high level in the game, or someone I barely talk to and sort of latch on to in order to avoid real life socializing, thus furthering my own anxiety about the outside world. I think it is essential to delete all online friends; of course taking them time to pull aside individuals and telling them why you are doing this is appropriate if you are very close with someone. If they really do care for you, they will understand. It will still be possible to stay in touch with them through other methods, if you so wish. \n\nGo through all your online platforms (Steam, Battle.net, Epic, etc.) and remove your friends one by one. This may seem extreme at first, but all it takes is one casual message from a person you love playing with to bring you crawling back. What is at first hard to do will become cathartic. This will prevent relapses in the future, and will give you a clear mind about leaving your games behind. Don\u2019t forget to remove people from other places you may have them added (Snapchat, Skype) as I have found this as well causes me to rationalize coming back, even though I know it isn\u2019t good for me.\n\n**Concept 3: What am I doing?**\n\nWe\u2019ve all had that moment when we find ourselves reinstalling our games and smack-dab in the middle of a lobby. Once we finish a huge gaming session 7 hours later, we always ask ourselves, \u201cwhat am I doing?.\u201d I fundamentally believe this comes from a place of not understanding why we are gaming in the first place. If you do not have a strong foundation or reasoning for why you are quitting, the cold turkey phase will not stick. What I suggest is writing down in a journal or personal diary of some kind the following things:\n\n1. Why am I quitting games?\n2. What have games done for me; what have I actually learned/gained in terms of skills\n3. Do I want to live my life in the constant pursuit of fleeting entertainment?\n   1. If not, what do I want to build my life towards\n4. What have games taken away from me, what have I lost? (This will be hard to reflect on)\n\nI believe this helps in recovery because it gives us something to fall back on when times get hard. We aren\u2019t simply sitting at the precipice of gaming or not gaming, we are working our way to something better, and it makes it even easier to build a strong foundation.\n\n**Concept 4: Building a Life Outside Gaming**\n\nThis one will be extraordinarily hard, and I admit I have not even done this myself yet. However, I realize this is the ultimate step someone will have to take to overcome addiction. I used to think that if I went cold-turkey it would simply be enough to cease the act of gaming and I would somehow have a better life afterwards. This is not true. What brought me to gaming was the constant stimulus, keeping my mind occupied, and not having to focus on anything else. In my case, this is about \\~15 years of being constantly stimulated by one of the most exciting things that human beings can have access to, and his hard to replace.\n\nThis is where the golden rule of 3 months cold-turkey that comes from nofap comes in handy. After this amount of time, your brain will have \u2018reset\u2019 itself to not need this ungodly amount of stimulus to be satisfied. But as I said, you will need to replace it with something in the meantime in order to stick to being away from gaming. This allows your mind to be occupied so you won\u2019t be constantly craving games again. Common solutions to this include: Reading books, playing instruments, taking up other hobbies, going to the gym/exercise (tends to help a lot because of the endorphin high) and others. I can\u2019t tell you exactly what it is you need to do to avoid boredom, but these are a few ideas. Personally, cleaning my apartment and meditation help me enormously to take some time to think on the above concepts and to reinforce positive attitudes and changes within myself.\n\nI believe we are all here because we want to ultimately better ourselves. We realize that gaming has become a problem for us, and that our addictions are actively preventing us from achieving in our lives. I truly think there are a lot of bright and good people that are drawn to games for the reasons mentioned above, and that we could all better reach our potential if we start to work at something that has taken control of our lives. I hope you agree with me, and decide to take this journey.\n\nIf there is anything I have failed to mention, please write it in the comments. This is a very rough guide I just came up with as a way to help me frame what I am going to do and the direction I am going in. Thanks for reading.",

            "selftext": "I've found myself growing bored of video games because I noticed patterns repeating over and over in game after game, and I think what I realized was this: I'm not learning anything new anymore by playing games!\n\nSure, there are sort of \"surface level\" things I learn when I boot up a new game, the symbols which refer to various things in the game often change (Different crafting recipes, items, armor, etc) but behind those symbols the systems themselves are repetitive! Win, lose, die, live, by acquiring some more of this or that. It started to feel like most games were just the same system (get some new stuff to be stronger and crush your enemies) reskinned over and over again. \n\nWhat I've come to realize is that that became boring to me because real life is not that simple, in real life there is an incredible amount of depth and nuance that goes far beyond simply acquiring better and better things. There's an element of building new relationships, encountering and understanding new and different systems, etc.\n\nA conversation with a friend is like a co-op puzzle game where, if you succeed, you both benefit! What game has something like this? What game lets you re-arrange the game itself on a systemic level, by acquiring an understanding of the systems in it?\n\nIn real life, every context contains different systems that emerge from that context, it's kind of beautiful. There's so much interconnection in nature, it's a whole tapestry of things.  Every person has unique experiences and stories which reveal, piece by piece, the bigger picture that we're all a part of.\n\nIn real life you can even create new systems with computers or with language, read books about them, talk to people about them. Hell, I've started getting interested in sociology, history, and physics, and the ways systems and the environment shape each other because unlike in games, there is a complex and interconnected structure to real life that is fascinating and, I think learning about it has made me a better person.\n\nReal life has thousands and thousands of systems you can encounter whereas most games, for one reason or another, don't seem to have nearly that level of depth or variety. They're kind of reductionist by their very nature, they reject complexity in favor of narrow ranges of possibility which pipe you from one area, map, server, to another.\n\nI think games taught me something, how to understand and think about systems and how the same system can be reskinned. I've started seeing the depth in everything and noticing that a lot of games simply don't have this depth. The problem is that most games are just replicating the same game systems over and over instead of introducing new ones or teaching me something new.\n\nI guess what I realized is that games oversimplify the complexity of reality to the point that they become less interesting than it. Maybe someday someone will create a game that mimics that systemic complexity and depth, but it's hard to imagine it ever being as interesting as real life has the potential to be. Anyway, technically games are part of real life and are nested within it, so real life will always have a 1up on games lol.\n\nIt's not that real life is always \"good\" either, because bad things happen and some of the systems in the world today have huge flaws and should maybe even be replaced, but I've realized that it's possible to apply the same types of systemic analysis that you use to learn a game, to everything. I guess to me the thing I was looking for in games, but didn't realize I was looking for, was understanding. Understanding of myself, of other people, of the world. The \"win\" or \"lose\" stuff and upgrades just get in the way of actually achieving this. When you win, you put an end to \"something\" but you don't come much closer to understanding the underlying processes and systems. The learning happens in between the winning and losing, but the learning is the part that's actually interesting.\n\nI think maybe it's possible to get to a point where you've \"learned everything games have to teach you\" and after that it becomes hard to decide what to do next, but what's worked for me is trying to use problem solving skills I learned in games to fix real problems, from real life. I guess real life is kind of like a co-op puzzle game, and we're all in it together trying to both understand the rules and maybe change them. Idk lol. Maybe I'm the exception but embracing the complexity of real life has helped me to become more satisfied with myself and to start to get out of my shell and move forward. \n\nSo I know I titled the post \"real life is the greatest game of all...\", but I don't really think the world is a game. It's so much more than that, it's something everyone on earth is building together all the time, and what could be more interesting than that?",

            "selftext": "Since i had 7 years old i've played video games. I spent all my adolescence playing video games and around those who did the same. I didn't recognize video games as a problem until i started noticing I was boycotting myself and setting myself up for failure on life (social, romantic and professionaly) and conjuring excuses on my head just to go play some more games. Games for me was an escape of this world which I never felt i was a part of and because of this, for me games have the same effect as drugs. I was in this mindless numb state for almost all my life and i couldn't live without it, i just didn't knew how and the only thing i was good at was playing games. After some years i started buying games through Steam and that was a fall into a deeper abyss. I spent a lot of my parents money on them and proceed to make up excuses so they could give me some more. I was at my first college at the time doing Computer Engineering and failed all my classes. I didn't have the basics down of disciplines like Math because i spent all my life playing video games and always passed with the lowest passing score but without understanding any subject. \n\nSo i was doomed for failure. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this college, in the year i was going to give up and start working maybe at McDonalds or something, I've met a teacher in the cyber security field. Is way of teaching was....different. He was very aggressive in the way he talked but i understood clearly his subjects. Who knew, right? So i started studying for myself everything related to hacking. I talked to him several times and he gave me some directions on what I should study and focus on. \n\nBefore this year ended i quit college......only to get back at it again but this time on the cyber security field. I have 28 years old now and I'm still in college but I learn Algebra which i was a complete failure at, I learned some Calculus which i never dreamed of understanding, I started hearing more music and developed a taste for it, I started playing guitar which i didn't even knew i liked it and I've met people which see me as a master programmer (which i don't think i am by any means) and strive to have the knowledge i have now. How my life did a 180\u00ba? I quit gamming. I focused on what i wanted to be and discover other things that i didn't even knew i liked. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis didn't happen overnight. I spent a lot of time fighting myself and accepting myself for who i was and what i have done with my life. Even today sometimes i got the urge to go gaming but i resist it or start working on some project of mine. I play guitar, watch videos on youtube about cyber security or music and go out with my girl to have fun.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo if i can do it, everybody can. Most people here probably don't have a problem as big as this with gaming but i hope at least some of you take something from my experience.",

It was bad, ripe with brutal historical inaccuracies. \nThe funny thing is, I learned my Roman History from from Rome Total War / Rome: Total Realism....... \n\nNot initially, the original gameplay was even worse than Hollywood, but I found my own way to play it. I would study Roman history online, save every turn, so I can go back if something non-historical happened, I would use the diplomacy system to maximum effect, eventually I even went into the game files and started hacking the gameplay to make the campaign play the way I wanted to. \n\nEach campaign was brutal, it took months, 396 years, 792 Turns and I could watch the Roman Empire grow year by year through my online studying downloaded mods and hacking.\n\n....... lol, but there I go, bragging about my pixelated non-existent achievements again ;)\n\nIt's interesting though, since watching that steaming pile of crap on Netflix, I've been getting the itch, I want to go back and do it again. I'm going through a tough.peroid Right now to so a distraction like that would be great. \n\nBut I won't, it's just unfortunate to realize that something liked was attached to something that wasn't any good for me. It's sad to think how games could even wrap themselves around and add a toxic element to something I really love learning about.",

This has gone down from around 30 hours 2 years ago. I feel like I could be using my time more usefully, as I do an awful lot of procrastination. I am only dependent on my phone for google maps, scanning notes and necessary calls. However, I always end up procrastinating, and when I don't game I feel unfulfilled and I get bored quicker when I am at home (this does not happen when I go in a library away from distractions). \n\nAnyone got any thoughts on whether I should quit? And any tips on ways to not procrastinate would be brilliant (cold turkey settings, website blockers, apps, revision methods, etc.)\n\nCheers!",

Fighting every day I am on a really good way to get out. Since everything got boring I set a goal to do my Motorcycle license which helped a lot. But since I dont like playing games anymore I have nothing else left than to play because I got used to it. I dont want to quit all together. 1-2 hours is enough for a nice hobby but I dont know what to do instead of massive amounts of playing video games. Nothing is fun or not as rewarding as gaming for such low effort. My mind strives for recreation. I had several hobbies like programming, drawing, reading, playing guitar or playing piano. I dropped all of them since learning something new requires strong will power to overcome those boring parts. I think my dopamine levels are just used to that high from gaming. Please help me to find something to do. That thing that will make me think about it the whole working day. Waking up at the mornings and strive to do that hobby. I heared about that dopamine fasting where you bore yourself to the point where you would enjoy just anything. I m not really interested in anything for longer periods of time. Which is really sad.\n\nThanks in advance my dear interent strangers!",

            "selftext": "\\[A throwaway account made for this sub. And it will be a wall of text cause I want this out of my system.\\] \n\nI had been wondering whether I should quit gaming or not for a while when I stumbled on this sub. And I sort of want to talk about it with ya? If I may. Because if you actually leave a hobby behind it is quite scary.\n\nFor me gaming is mostly a way to escape \u2013 I picked my first games consciously specifically to lose myself in one of my first uni summers, when my mom got ill and I was stuck at home because I had to look after her. She was tied to bed, a husk of her former self, with personality changes caused by illness, and I had to be close but couldn\u2019t stand being near her. I also was 17. So I looked into a geek magazine I owned, chose a few games I liked from the ones mentioned there and got lost in them.\n\nI can\u2019t say that games ruined my study/work too much, I had enough force of will to stop when necessary (but I persisted when I didn\u2019t need to, lol, my recurrent problem), but they sure took a lot of time from me. The other thing that they took is, I think, is normal human connections, because I didn\u2019t get out much and subsidized meeting people irl with hanging out around gaming communities. I am depressed and have self-esteem issues, so I am honestly scared to meet people irl. Internet alleviates a lot of the initial friction, but I am unable to form meaningful connections in it too.\n\nLater, when I was stuck in an unsatisfying job, a dead end in life, the aspect that was more important to me was the sense of measurable predictable progress that games gave, I suppose. I worked in Academia, which is oppressive in itself, with no prospects of growth, severely underpaid, people around were leaving and dying or already twisted. The whole situation drove me into the sort of depression when you can\u2019t eat or sleep and your whole body aches. I am normally not suicidal (I just want to disappear), but I was almost there. Ironically this low was when I completed Dark Souls. People say that you have to git good to play it, i.e. to be strong, but from my pov you just need to spend an ungodly amount of time and effort on a game, not life, i.e. it\u2019s a good chance that it\u2019s your weak point.\n\nSince, as I\u2019ve mentioned I am not big on killing myself despite being hardly stable, I tried to change my line of work. And this experience became one of the reasons I want to quit.\n\nI took a yearlong course to move to another field, and since it took almost all my evenings I couldn\u2019t game. And it\u2019s plain as a day that when you don\u2019t game you can achieve more results. If I want to grow into the field despite being a late beginner I also probably need all of my little free time. I also have to sort out a lot of personal shit.\n\nIt\u2019s also obvious that games give very little back. They helped me with English and they probably taught me how to learn new systems to an extent, but it\u2019s not much and they\u2019re not the only way. Maybe gaming is more useful for IT people as a gateway to profession, but I am not in IT, and I can\u2019t even mention gaming as a hobby in a conversation (even if people won\u2019t judge it\u2019s pointless). 99,9% of games don\u2019t give you any useful info on the world, stories are weak, there\u2019s not much to think about except how to win, skills are not transferable to real life and you sit or lie down which is not great for your health (but your shoulders are tense a lot of the time, which gives you headaches). And it\u2019s mostly same old \u2013 you kill one boss to run around and kill another boss, rinse and repeat. Ok, some games are impactful (like Inside or Shadow of the Colossus), but it\u2019s a much smaller percentage than movies or books.\n\nAnd the other issue is that I am female. And the gaming community is very hostile to women most of the time. People routinely verbally attack you for your gender alone, there\u2019s a shitton of sexism going in the background (I\u2019ve seen the same thread on several of gaming communities, which read along the lines of \u201cWomen\u2019s bodies are garbage and spread disease, you should be drunk or mad to stick your dick in those dirty wet holes\u201d). And then you talk to a guy about games and cooking, even share recipes. You feel good about these interactions because it\u2019s as they should be in a hobbyist space, where people share a passion\u2026 And then he blows up on you with something about \u201cdick carousel\u201d and posts comments about how women are worse than tapeworms. It\u2019s painful and scary. It\u2019s honestly hurt me quite a bit and caused trust issues. I want to have a boyfriend one day, and this makes me think that maybe it isn\u2019t worth it. I think that maybe I will be healthier if I cut this whole thing from my life and meet some normal men. (I am sorry by the way, if it\u2019s unpleasant to read, but it\u2019s honestly more or less quotes and one of the many from what has been happening daily for many years in several gaming spaces.) I\u2019ve stubbornly refused to leave for some time because I didn\u2019t want to humor these people (I also spoke up and then the abuse increased, as you can guess), but I it\u2019s started to take its toll on my mental state. I tried to look for female dominated spaces, but I wasn\u2019t a good fit into the one I found (I did fine, but didn\u2019t enjoy it either).\n\nThe thing is that I like games. When I strip this all down I know I like synthetic media like comics and games, liked since happier times in my childhood. I do need something for quieter home evenings, when I recharge, and I don\u2019t know what it can be. I won\u2019t be able to switch to movies or TV, I can\u2019t sit passively through a video. And if we talk arthouse I don\u2019t want to watch something pretentious about torture and sex and suffering. Maybe I could pick up reading again, tho I get tired from letters on work. At least it is enriching. And games themselves are very safe in terms of thought, with all my trauma I am afraid to run into sexism again, and it\u2019s very real in literature. \n\nGetting an active hobby in real life is a necessity at this point, I know, but too scary for me atm. I am working on it, but it\u2019s a slow process. \n\nBasically, I don\u2019t have things to fall back on.\n\nMaybe I could continue to allow myself small gaming sessions with something less time consuming, like indie action adventures, but it won\u2019t help with hurtful toxicity and it\u2019s time lost for nothing. I have invested a lot into gaming through years (yeah, it\u2019s a bad argument) tho, and it is one of the few things that still brings me joy\u2026\n\nBut then it\u2019s not like continuing to game will help me in any way? I\u2019ve tried after all. And when I do game I can\u2019t easily manage it in terms of time, I start to sacrifice sleep (honestly, games are designed with no respect for time management whatsoever) and it\u2019s something I want to avoid for health reasons. What do I gain killing another monster? I don\u2019t grow through it, I get up in the same state of inner turmoil.\n\nTldr: it will probably be better to cut gaming out of my life completely, but I am don\u2019t know how to proceed, due to my depression and trauma, plus I am afraid that taking games away will lead to burn out and breakdowns.",

            "selftext": "Hello stopgamers:\nI'm currently in my mid-late teens and giving this my best shot yet. I'm 30-40 days in (lost count but I think somewhere around there). I am slightly annoyed/angry at my brain ATM and am wondering if what I'm experiencing is normal.\n\nThe first 4 days were very difficult for me trying to stop. I went cold turkey (I only played maybe 3 hours a day, but spent maybe 2 hours more reading gaming wikis or watching videos) and was mind numbingly bored. I briefly tried making YouTube videos about Tolkienan linguistics, though I found video editing to not be to my taste.\n\nWeeks 2 and 3 were frankly very easy. I was totally fine and happy, maybe even moreso than without games, and was doing a lot of things that made me feel really good about who I was (notably conlanging and practicing trombone a lot).\n\nHowever, after week 3, I think about 24-26 days in, everything changed. I started becoming extremely anxious about everything, and desperately needed to escape life, as my friends were less inclined to being around me since I would snap quickly. They have since staged an intervention trying to get me to go back to gaming, as they view my quitting as a form of emotional self harm. I have told them I don't want to hear it again until we can have a serious discussion when I'm roughly 3 months into this, and they've begrudgingly agreed to this.\n\nSince all this, my anxiety and desperate need for escape has become worse. I spend most of my time conlanging and worldbuilding when I'm not busy so I can at least mentally escape, though it does not provide relief to the degree gaming did.\n\nI pledged to stick to not gaming until at least 3 months in, at which point I would reevaluate the impact that they had on my life and decide whether to quit permanently. I plan to hold to this pledge. However, I am curious if what I'm experiencing is common, that being that the withdrawal is getting worse over a month in. Have any of you all experienced this? Also I felt like posting this because I need to vent. Thanks for reading.",

            "selftext": "\\- from all gaming. After 30 days I'll reintroduce VR-games, which have never been a problem for me. I'll abstain from normal games like GTAV and Assassins Creed for 90 days, then I'll evaluate the process. Hopefully I won't need them anymore, as I've established new habits that are more relevant to real life. Instead of gaming, I'll read at least 24 pages a day on subjects I have to retake in the autumn, apply for part-time jobs, do more prehab workouts (as I'm already pumping enough iron), and then watch some series in the evening when I've completed my daily goals. Any pro tips as I begin this journey?",

            "selftext": "I won\u2019t go over my whole life story but it\u2019s one that every addicted gamer can at least partly recognize themselves in. For me the games that consumed my life was League of Legends and Oldschool Runescape. I\u2019m 20yo and for the past 5-10 years i developed a severe gaming addiction that made me neglect all my friends, family, education and health.\n\nThe way i quit gaming might be hard to follow, but i knew the only way that would work for me was a full stop. Three weeks ago i decided to simply unplug my whole setup and put it on the top shelf in the garage. I am unable to play in moderation so if i was to quit i had to do it properly, playing less and less with the hope of quitting would never work in my case.\n\nWhat happend when i no longer had access to gaming, was that my brain was forced to look for the dopamine rush that gaming used to provide elsewhere. I was also forced to find other ways to spend my freetime.\n\nI started working out at the gym as much as i can (my goal for now is 3 times per week), started forcing myself to socialize with the few remaining friends i had left, and made an effort to work on myself as a human being (got a nice haircut, bought new clothes and i\u2019m currently working on improving my terrible skin).\n\nJust this weekend i went out to the pub with my friends for the first time in forever, met a beautiful girl, got lucky and lost my virginity! I\u2019m currently struggling with being obsessed and madly in love with said girl and knowing she doesnt feel the same way back is a terrible feeling. When i had a shower this morning i realized that having that problem however is 100x better than being obsessed with something as pointless as online video games.\n\nCurrently it feels like my addiction to video games has turned into an addiction for life. I thought i would have terrible drawbacks but i\u2019m having so much fun with life right now that i don\u2019t imagine i will.\n\nI hope this post can serve as some kind of motivation for people trying to quit or thinking about quitting. While i am still sad that gaming stole a part of my life (my teens), this feeling is absolutely amazing and i can\u2019t wait to LIVE LIFE.\n\nPS: Sorry for the terrible grammar, English is not my native language and i\u2019m typing this from my phone (as my computer is no longer avaliable!).",

I've had periods of months without gaming, but when I just \"try a little bit\", as when I bought a PS4 recently,  I end up playing far into the night and forgetting to eat and sleep. I don't know if  games where you build or level up something through farming, like GTA online or Assassins Creed, is possible for my brain to balance with my real life progress. It seems like my brain is either focusing on real life goals or improving a virtual life. VR games like In Death, Beat Saber and Superhot don't have the same effect on me; I can play for 10-30 minutes, then I feel like I've had a bit of fun and I'm eager to do something in real life. Whenever I feel the urge to play GTA, I feel like I'm at a fork in the road between feeling my feelings or running away from them. I think it's a coping mechanism I use to not confront real obstacles to my development, as I am 26 years old and dropped out of three different university programs.I just ran down to the studio and did a 20 minutes prehab routine instead of gaming and I feel calmer and more conscious now, which is how the thought that quitting gaming might be a good idea. Any thoughts or tips? Do you recognize any of these patterns?",

            "selftext": "**Part 2 of guide: \\*link soon, there's a 10min wait between posts\\***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Preface: Please read.**\n\n\\- This 'guide' is my attempt at putting all major info on quitting gaming in one place. It's largely based off the amazing contributions of other people in this subreddit r/stopgaming.\n\n\\-  I hope it'll be of help; although, I haven't experienced the scale of addition a few others had, so please criticize anything. Sorry if some parts of this sound too harsh - or the opposite?\n\n\\- Here I use the term 'gaming', but some things below could apply to any online 'addiction' in general if things are getting out of control, and not just games. Especially parts 1, 3 and 4.\n\n\\- When I say all-in-one, I mean it. I tried to cover everything from realizing the addiction and downsides, preparing to quit and doing it, and the benefits, inspiration and 'hobby' ideas.\n\n\\- It seems long, but I've tried keeping the text condensed with only the important points, almost as a list. Please read it ALL first before doing anything or commenting? Thanks and good luck.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Part 1: The realization and downsides**\n\nImage: [https://bit.ly/2Vo2XQG](https://bit.ly/2Vo2XQG)\n\n\\- Technology is a useful, essential tool in the modern world - but only if used moderately. Although gaming has became a typical hobby, it's not a healthy habit, especially if overused.\n\n\\- Since you've found this guide, you're probably concerned with your online time, so have started to see an issue. Here are some hopefully motivational reasons as to why quit games;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Put things into perspective. The presently visible perspective would be you, sitting still staring at a glowing screen for hours, living a virtual reality while ignoring the real deal.\n\n\\- Then there's the obvious long-term perspective. Is spending half of your precious life gaming while ignoring the reality something your future you - would appreciate or thank you for?\n\n\\- Think of successful people, those you look up to (or your future self again) - Do you think they'd even bother gaming; would it benefit their life or career and help them achieve goals?\n\n\\- Essentially, you are putting a part of your life into/depending on a fragile metal box full of circuits and electronics, which outputs pre-coded stuff to you on a flat screen in front of you.\n\n\\- Games are coded to give a false sense of security and progress - something which comes slow in life - making you want to play more through temporary ingame rewards and 'achievements'.\n\n\\- The achievements are only 'useful' in the game, and the rewards allow you to level up to get more rewards to level up and - what for? It's a cycle that consumes your time irreversibly.\n\n\\- You don't need to prove anything to anyone - competition keeps you ingame. Getting on the leader boards of some game or earning top rewards won't benefit you long-term in your life.\n\n\\- Gaming may have also literally cost you more than you wanted or realized. The games, any ingame purchases, gaming setups/accessories, etc. What could you have bought otherwise?\n\n\\- There are also the usual screen-time problems you tend to ignore - long-term worsening your eyesight, fatigue, headaches, moods, bad lifestyle or hygiene, electromagnetic radiation...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- So is it all worth it or will it pay off? Are you avoiding the unavoidable in life while probably breaking more? Is gaming even fun anymore, or just an escape, distraction or competition?\n\n\\- Life has to be faced. And only you can change it, no matter how hard it is - life isn't perfect for anyone, but wasting it and running away from the unavoidable problems is only worse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Part 2: The quitting and preparations**\n\nImage: [https://bit.ly/2V4Trg8](https://bit.ly/2V4Trg8)\n\n\\- In many ways quitting is all about the realization. You should realize the problems associated with gaming, and the problems that led you into gaming/are keeping you away from quitting.\n\n\\- For many, gaming is an escape from life or relationship problems and responsibilities, which is understandable - but hiding from these unavoidable problems will do no good to help you.\n\n\\- Quitting gaming is a big step, but it should be done when things get out of control. It will require great self-discipline, but once you hit rock bottom you can 'restart the right way'.\n\n\\- Don't treat quitting games as restricting yourself. If you really want to quit, you'd have realized the downsides, and found gaming to be the restriction - from fixing life and chasing its benefits.\n\n\\- Gaming is ok in moderation, as I'll expand upon later, but when it consumes too much while giving back little, it becomes a problem. So to quit, here are some preparations to consider;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- The sunk cost fallacy often prevents quitting. You're chained to your progress/achievements, not wanting to let the hours played waste. That's understandable, and there are ways around.\n\n\\- You could just leave your games and accounts and just quit, but this seems far too simple, and usually ends up in being an easy temptation to come back, 'just for that one more game'.\n\n\\- One way to let go would be simply deleting your accounts - especially for the games you don't like or have made little progress in. But for the high-level accounts, this can be harder to do.\n\n\\- If you feel you aren't ready to fully let go of the progress, there are other ways to consider. You could preferrably uninstall the game, but leave the account and progress saved 'in case'.\n\n\\- You might take a few screenshots or record a clip of your best achievements. Or, give your 'pre-loved' account for someone else to use by replacing the account email to their one?\n\n\\- Then there are the gaming communities, like Discord or Reddit. These can fuel the need to compete, get rewards to show off and keep playing, or make you feel left out of the 'fun'.\n\n\\- The sensible thing to do is quit them. The main point of all this is to get rid of triggers.  But while gaming, many people end up having their main 'friends' online, in such communities. \n\n\\- You're ok to keep in touch with these people if you want to, as long as they can understand your choice to quit and can talk to you outside of gaming and without fueling the addiction.\n\n\\- You could add these people as friends on a single app, e.g. Discord, although be careful as this one's gamer-based. Just a way to keep in touch; although remember real life relations await.\n\n\\- You should also stop following any gaming-focused streams, websites, subreddits etc. about the games that you're planning on quitting anyway. You know you could use that time better.\n\n\\- Lastly, you could physically make the device you game on hard to access or set up. Unplug, hide or put it somewhere uncomfortable to reduce temptation to turn on and game so easily.\n\n\\- You can get someone, usually a relative, to help you. They could motivate and support you in general if they are willing to help you quit the unhealthy habit. Your relations could improve.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Whatever works for you, you'll eventually have to quit the habit of gaming. When you're feeling ready - or have had enough? - there are 2 main ways people have quit gaming. They are;\n\n\\- Firstly, you can go full-on cold turkey - one day just cut off gaming and try not to look back. The second method seems softer and involves gradually cutting back your time online.\n\n\\- Some people also game in-between periods of breaks, but this isn't really quitting, and can end up with them taking a longer break then coming back to full-on all day gaming sessions.\n\n\\- Gradually reducing game time can be good and less 'noticeable', but I think continuing to compete/progress at a game isn't necessary the way to quit, and requires much more discipline.\n\n\\- If you actually delete/prepare your accounts and games, then a cold turkey would be the way to take since you'd have gotten rid of many gaming triggers. But - are you prepared to change?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Part 2 of guide: \\*link soon, there's a 10min wait between posts\\***",

Not due to the fact that I was gaming TOO much, but that I was gaming for the most part of my free time while I knew that I could be doing more important things. I also couldn't enjoy games like when I was younger. It feels like I'm losing interst towards games, and it somewhat scares me.\n\nI don't know how long this will last but I did this to avoid feeling any urge to game while I'm on a trip (Going in Germany in 2 weeks with people from my school in the language program, it would be a real shame to be bored over there because I want to game)\n\n\nSo that was my little rant. No game has hyped me  for its release like GTA V had done back in 2013. Maybe I'll play again if I learn to appreciate games more again, who knows.",

However, when it comes to improving at an online game, the result might be terrible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n To be honest, online gaming creates this scenario where the player needs to have a big amount of skill to beat the others. However, it never seems to be fun. It's always a frustrating experience just to waste hours on the screen and, once you get there, it feels as if you haven't done nothing at all. You become the big fish in the small pond. But the more you dig into it, the more you'll see there are bigger fish, which equals into more frustrating practice on a shitty computer that you could be using to write a great novel or something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   I think I quit gaming for now. Hope this helps for the ones who are getting into online. I'm just going to say this: the fun disappears, so your time.",

For this I'm using Facebook marketplace and eBay. The best part of it is that any cash or PayPal sales from PC parts and other things goes towards a new bed, new clothes, etc. \n\nLastly, I'll be starting a Photography blog for myself with the new Camera I bough from selling my PC. It's going to be about hiking photography and technology that compliments that. This will be called \"Project Passionfruit\" (for personal reasons).   \n\n\nI stil play some games on my PS4 with my mates, but its been much better and I'm thankful for the tips and support on this forum!

            "selftext": "I'll divide this post into sections, including major points, you don't have to read everything though.\n\nExactly 5 months ago I wrote a post here on StopGaming, you can find it here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/a4cop1/starting\\_today\\_story\\_time\\_anyone\\_dry\\_eye\\_syndome/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/a4cop1/starting_today_story_time_anyone_dry_eye_syndome/)\n\nToday, I was going over my old Reddit accounts, deleting one by one. When I visited MeioMei, I had a few messages in the inbox. People were asking me how I was doing and about dry eye syndrome. That's why I decided to create this post and share with you my successful journey.\n\n**What you should know about me before you start**\n\nI'm a former professional player, who had to quit pro league because of a dry eye syndrome. I suffered from extreme social anxiety (couldn't pick up phones, couldn't buy myself food in the shop, was even scared to talk to people I knew) from childhood and depression for the past 3 years. I study computer science major.\n\n**What happened to me after the post**\n\nSo, 5 months ago I created the mentioned post. It probably radiates motivation, but in fact, this is the time when I hit the very rock bottom in my life. I lied in bed for like 2 weeks straight, barely eating and balancing on the edge of insanity. I was already fighting depression for several years before this, but this was the ultimate knock-out. In the end, I passed the semester, but I was completely destroyed, I returned home and decided to give up for this year. It makes me sick just when I think about this period of my life. Luckily for me, I met an old friend and we talked for 3 weeks straight and she sparked hope inside of me. I was convinced to return to school and to keep fighting - and that's what I did. As my home is 5 hours from the university, I got to live with my former schoolmate in his flat, but after a few days, I realized I need to get out of there. He was drinking with friends a lot, and there was a day when he wouldn't even let me inside lol. And this is a turning point in my life. Nearly living on the street, I faced my social anxiety like never before. I had to buy food, I had to take money from the cash machine, I had to call people, I had to talk to people. I expanded my comfort zone a lot and in the end found a place to live in with a student couple, where I happily live to this day.\n\nWhen the crisis was over, I didn't stop there. I had the momentum and I kept going. Every day I went a little further and today I take care of myself completely. I decided to quit my major anyway, but not because I wanted to escape, but because I was very behind in everything after the previous stage of my life. Right now I'm self-taught C# developer who is looking for a job, I'm continuing my CS major next year at a different school.\n\n**What I accomplished**\n\n\\- Video game addict (12-15hr/day) -&gt; playing games very occasionally\n\n\\- Beat my social anxiety - mostly\n\n\\- Beat my depression\n\n\\- I live on my own without any help at the age of 19\n\n\\- Finally, I started gaining weight after being underweight for my whole life (188cm 64kg -&gt; 70kg, and I'm now talking about muscle, not fat).\n\n**How I conquered gaming addiction**\n\nYou might be surprised I didn't include any games in my story. That's simply because I was busy with life.\n\nAfter things calmed down, I had a chance to play again. Not gonna lie, I played, and I still had gaming binges, but each time I got back on track fairly quickly. Personally, I divide my success into 2 parts.\n\n***Abstention:*** I lost gaming urges after not playing for a while. This is the effect of so-praised 30-day detox, your brain returns to normal when you stop flooding it with dopamine (read neuroplasticity). If you read my old post, you know that I started considering playing as an addiction around 3 years ago and I conquered it fairly recently. To get over this part it is extremely helpful to get out of your environment.\n\n***Determine where games stand in your life:*** After you no longer have gaming urges, you should start thinking about the purpose of games in your life. I said, that even though I didn't have urges, I still had few gaming binges. That's because I didn't know what is the purpose of games in my life. I had a fear of missing out - The technology develops quickly, AI, VR, and what if my future girlfriend likes games? Will I just watch? I felt bad for missing out on those things. This led to me trying to moderate, I literally played games for an hour just to see if I can do the moderation. Well, I can't. So I made a compromise with myself. I won't play games unless I'm invited to do so by someone who is close to me in real life and we play together side by side. This way I know there is an option to play, so I'm not missing out on anything and at the same time I don't waste any more useless hours grinding and fighting in infinite arenas. And you know what? I haven't played since then. This is a personality change, you need to find your own fears and reasons.\n\n**Quitting games is just a tool**\n\nPurpose of quitting gaming is to allow you to do other things in life. If you quit and don't substitute it with something else, I guarantee you that you become depressed and eventually slip back into playing again. If you don't have anything to substitute it with, dedicate yourself to finding that thing. Don't quit just for the purpose of quitting, you will make yourself miserable.\n\n**Neuroplasticity - it's about your physical body, too**\n\nIf you substitute gaming with scrolling social media feeds 24/7, nothing will change, you will still be unmotivated to do anything. Imagine your brain as a machine, that constantly changes based on its input (It's called neuroplasticity and it actually is a thing). When a person goes blind, the section that handled visual interpretation shrinks for the purpose of other senses. That's why people experience an increase in hearing and touching abilities when they go blind. I bet you had this moment in your life when nothing else than games was fun. You just wanted to play, everything else felt like a waste of time. That's because of dopamine. Games artificially create dopamine that floods your brain and your brain in response reduces dopamine receptors. That means that you need more dopamine to feel gratified. And when you are in this state when dopamine receptors are greatly reduced, now real life activities just don't produce enough dopamine to make you feel interested, only games do. Social media work in a very similar manner, they produce dopamine. You literally become what you do, your brain changes based on that. That's why 30-day detox works.\n\n**How to reach your goals -** ***Don't be an athlete, be a long distance runner***\n\nIn order to reach your goals, you need to build habits that can get you there. If you read Atomic Habits then you know that tiny changes lead to remarkable results. It doesn't matter if you overwhelm yourself with 50 new habits for a week and then burn out (because that's what will happen). That's like you didn't do anything at all. We tend to have these days when we just want to change our lives drastically, but that's not how it works, it's a continual process. Rather start 1 habit, do it for a week and then when you feel motivated again, start another one. They will build up and soon you will see effects. Also, don't punish yourself if you miss a day or two. Let's say you want to lose weight - You decide to remove the cheese from your diet. You go without cheese for 3-4 days and then one day you feel down, and you just can't help yourself and eat one. It's ok as long as you get back on track. Don't beat yourself up and you will be ready to skip the cheese tomorrow. And here you are, you skipped cheese 6 days out of 7, what an accomplishment. You can use tracking apps to help you with that, but remember that goal is not to have 50 checkboxes that you just must check in before the sunset. The goal is to incorporate these habits into your personality to the point where you don't think about it and do it automatically. Also, don't think about what you got to do too much, just do it. The more you worry, the less you get done. The less you get done, the more you worry.\n\n**For those who suffer from social anxiety**\n\nIt's actually very simple. You just need to get information about things and try them out. Once you are familiar with them, anxiety goes away. The least you can do is to get a book about social situations, or about whatever that makes you anxious. Passively get information, become familiar with the unfamiliar.\n\nYou also need to move the boundaries a little further each time. Try to make a little quest for yourself. It can be as tiny as you want and you get used to it, maybe you even start seeking it. Today, you will go to the shop and buy this thing. Today, you will wear this shirt, even though it has this logo on it. Today, you will talk to a stranger. I mean it can be whatever, depending on where your boundaries are set. Don't get me wrong, I'm still a very anxious person, but I try to move my boundaries further, and it works.\n\n**For those who suffer from depression**\n\nI wasn't severely depressed, but I'm definitely someone who went through a long period of depression. I want you to know that there always is hope, but you must seek it. It's a very broad subject and people are depressed for many different reasons. I can tell you how I beat mine, but I'm not an expert and if you experience any suicidal thoughts you should seek professional help.\n\nWhat I would say to myself is: Don't think, do. You feel it deep inside of you, that something ain't alright, but you just keep trying to figure it out as I did. Your vision of the world is very likely to be distorted in a very bad way and you can't figure it out on your own, you see things as they aren't. How can you produce correct output, if there is faulty input? You need to seek different points of view if you want to create objective output. If you just keep thinking with what you already have, nothing is going to change. My first important step was accepting that I'm depressed and that my point of view could be distorted. Then I started reading a book which is called Feeling good written by Dr. Burns. This book takes you on a tour and introduces you to many depressed individuals and their distorted points of view. I think you can't go wrong with this book. Just get out of your head, and do! I hope you get well, don't lose hope.\n\nThank you for your time, I hope you find some information useful. And for the love of god, read self-help books.",

            "selftext": "I started to write out a list of various ways that games can fulfill our need(s) to grow and improve, to the point where we can potentially cut off our real life progress in the process.  That list was getting pretty long, so I figured I'd post the list here.\n\nFirst of all, I want to acknowledge that games can fulfill a lot of different human needs simultaneously, and not all of them need to be progression-based.  This thread could easily be titled \"Various Patterns of Human Relations\" and focus on that aspect of gaming instead.\n\nPersonally though, progression has been the primary psychological grip that various games currently have on me, so that's what I have been thinking about lately.  For others, progression might be cool and all, but not the primary reason they play games or become addicted.  So I realize that this is level detail about progression may not apply to everyone.\n\nWith that out of the way, here's an abstract list of the various approaches to progression that games take.\n\n**Zero sum game** - I win, others lose\n\n**Co-op experience** - We win, they lose\n\n**Just get to the finish line** - Go from point A to point B, to point C, etc. until nowhere else to go and the end credits roll.\n\n**Speed run** - Learn optimal ways for how to get from Point A to Point Z as quickly as possible.\n\n**Blind play-through** - Even though meta-knowledge of a game is publicly available, purposefully play a game with zero prior knowledge and see how far you get by winging it.\n\n**Min/max character builds** - Within the ruleset(s) the game has provided (i.e. without cheating), place one particular stat or characteristic above all others and see how far you can push it.  For example: Maximum possible strength, even if it means all other stats suffer as a result.  Maximum score, Maximum gold, maximum damage output, etc.\n\n**Economical character builds** - Within the ruleset(s) of the game, focus on most economical use of resources.  Minimize waste, minimize diminishing returns or negative side-effects from min/maxing.\n\n**100% completion** - Do every possible activity that the game has to offer.\n\n**Collector** - Acquire every possible item, character, or piece of gear that the game has to offer.\n\n**Epic run / Epic match** - Build up skills and acquire meta knowledge of a particular game.  Regardless of what that rogue-like or multiplayer game randomly throws at you, figure out how to turn that into an epic experience.\n\n**Perfect game** - For games that have the mechanics that allow it, play that particular game without making a single mistake.  For example: Dark Souls without ever getting hit once, or a baseball game without giving up a single base hit.\n\n**Nightmare mode** - Intentionally make the game more difficult than originally intended, and see how far you get.\n\nI think there are others, but I need to cut this thread short because the coffee shop where I'm typing this out is closing.  I'll add more to this list, but does anyone have any other abstract forms of game progression that I might have missed?\n\nThe main reason for this list, at least for me, is that I think that we sometimes default to thinking that real life needs to experienced as zero sum.  But we are actually free to create whatever narratives we want.",

            "selftext": "Hi ya'll, great community. I quit gaming years ago. I actually sold almost all of my consoles (a few need repairing before I can sell those as well).\n\nHowever, as you know, gaming has become a part of modern culture. Even when I read the news, it's hard not to come across an article about a video game, drama on steam, speedrun records, trivia, memes based on games, portraits of e-sports (lol) athletes and the list goes on.\n\nThis has made it hard for me to leave the scene entirely. While I do not play anymore, I still watch let's plays and gaming news channels once in a while. Or the odd speedrun.\n\nI also like to listen to songs from the original soundtrack of videogames I played and I cheer myself up with gaming related fanfic, memes etc.\n\nI would like to hear your thoughts about that. Did you just quit gaming and kept enjoying videogame culture like me or did you leave that behind as well? If so, why?\n\nI'm asking because I feel like videogames were a bubble for me, and anything related to videogames keeps me in that bubble. It gives me a false sense of belonging, as I feel connected with gamers when they encounter certain situations or issues in games. But deep down I know that I'm fooling myself and that makes me feel uncomfortable.\n\nI quit playing games, but I have never left gaming culture behind. I am about to do so, but it's a little bit scary, I don't know why. Maybe because gaming was - and still is - a big part of my life.\n\nDid anyone feel the same?",

I love playing Fire emblem Heroes, it\u2019s always fun for to just see my favorite units in my castle or clearing difficult content with a team i\u2019ve spent months building. \n\nFor the most part I don\u2019t usually spend money on this game but I\u2019ve bought an orb pack once in a while, and before I would just use up itunes cards until I had 0 orbs left and called it a day.\n\nHowever I recently got a credit union card and decided to buy myself a $12.99 pack of orbs and complementary feathers.\n\nNow for some backstory, There\u2019s currently a banner going on where a new powerful super exclusive unit is released and can only get summoned on that specific banner type every few months along with other good heroes to give away skills or use.\nI had actually already gotten the star of the banner, Legendary Alm, but unfortunately he came with less than ideal stats, song with that was Sue who has a very exclusive skill that I desperately wanted to give to another unit of mine. After blowing through the first orb pack and getting nothing I decided to lightly spend again but this time getting a cheaper pack of $5.99. Blew through that and bought another $5.99. Blew through that and bought a $5.99 and a $1.99 those went too and then i bought my final 2 packs both $1.99. I ended up wasting around $42 and ended up getting nothing besides 1 unit I didn\u2019t actually need. \n\nIm now left with around 53 or so dollars in my credit union card, down from around $96.\nOf course this is nothing to huge but It\u2019s made me realize how much of a problem I actually have with this. I had always known seeing as to how I couldn\u2019t go more than 1 day without spending in game currency. \nI don\u2019t want to completely stop playing but I don\u2019t wanna get into the habit of thinking if I keep buying I\u2019ll eventually get what I want. \nIdk I just want help or resources pls",

            "selftext": "So after completing my no-gaming challenge a few months ago I think I am at a point now where I no longer have a problem with gaming. I have to confess that I missed gaming however, and I had no desire to just stay completely away from any form of gaming after the end of my challenge. The truth is that video games have been a part of my life since I was very young. And while I certainly did spend too much time playing certain games at certain times in my life, I do not regret all of it\u2026\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do regret spending hundreds of literal real-life days playing WoW or thousands of hours of Team Fortress 2. I regret playing dozens of games of Civilization lasting around 10 hours on average and hundreds of hours of Warcraft 3 multiplayer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI regret this time and consider most of it wasted. Plain and simple.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do not regret finishing games like *Portal*, *Breath of the Wild* or *Hollow Knight* however. Those were meaningful experiences that will stay with me forever and I am looking forward to *Silksong* or whatever self-contained single-player game Valve plans on releasing someday (if they ever do it). I do not even regret playing some hugely long games like the *Mass Effect* or *Dark Souls* trilogy or recently *Sekiro*. As dumb as it sounds those games don\u2019t feel like a waste of time. They have artistic merit and are part of my culture as any book or movie would be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith this in mind, I defined some clear limits for myself and my gaming which worked pretty well so far. Your mileage may vary. Maybe you don\u2019t have a nostalgic/romantic history with different kinds of games and are just addicted to that one game  (which seems to be an increasing problem nowadays the way modern online games are made). Maybe you have an incredibly addictive personality and would become addicted to any video game. In that case this is probably not for you. If you recognize yourself in what I described above, however, or you\u2019re currently doing your challenge and want to have something to look forward to and motivate you, feel free to try to live by these 10 commandments to avoid toxic gaming behavior.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 1. Thou shall not play games that are \u201clive services\u201d.\n\nThis is an important one as the gaming industry seems to be progressively shifting towards this. It\u2019s hardly subtle but any game that presents itself as a constantly evolving experience, provides a constant flow of new but ultimately meaningless new content and rewards you with things like login rewards, daily quests, timed-events, double-experience events, etc. is just trying to keep you hooked. Those games are preying on your FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) and nothing more. This is a huge red flag and you\u2019re probably not actually having fun but just playing because \u201cyou have to\u201d.\n\n# 2. Thou shall avoid multiplayer games.\n\nLong gone are the days where multiplayer gaming meant inviting a few buddies over to play console games on the couch with some pizza and drinks or having a nice social weekend organizing a sleepover LAN party. Nowadays multiplayer games, no matter if they\u2019re coop or competitive are a miserable and lonely affair consisting spending entire days in front of a screen, playing and replaying the same content over and over again in order to progress or get better. Make no mistake, your online \u201cfriends\u201d just see you as a replaceable means to an end and anything you could achieve is ultimately meaningless. Your entire family or whoever you live  with, even if they don\u2019t game themselves, are probably also keenly aware by now that you can\u2019t pause a multiplayer game which is frankly kind of pathetic if something happens in real life that requires your attention. Especially if you\u2019re an adult with actual responsibilities.\n\n# 3. Thou shall challenge yourself but not overly so.\n\nOne of the more fun things about video games are the challenges they offer. Challenges are what make most video games interesting. However, don\u2019t overdo it. It will impress nobody and the frustration if you can\u2019t overcome the challenge or if it\u2019s overly time-consuming or difficult will just make you miserable.\n\n# 4. Thou shall not give gaming priority over other, more important things.\n\nVideo games can be a great way to kill some time and unwind but the best thing is probably to know in advance when you will have to stop every time you start. Either because you have something else planned that day or simply because you have to go to bed. In any case, you should always be able to turn off whatever game you\u2019re playing at any time if something more important happens in your life.\n\n# 5. Thou shall not play a game to for longer than you enjoy it.\n\nOnce the credits roll, consider the game finished. Do not obsess over your experience by playing the same game again with a different character class or by trying to get every single achievement. At that point you\u2019re just wasting your time. No matter how great and fun the game was. Don\u2019t cry because it\u2019s over. Smile because it happened. If you have downtime to kill there are probably other meaningful experiences to have, and certainly not just video games.\n\n# 6. Thou shall not start games that you know you should not be able to finish.\n\nVideo games take time to play. If you have a lot going on in life right now, if you just had a kid, if you have to go up early tomorrow or if you have to study for your finals in a week, it\u2019s probably not a great idea to start that 100-hour JRPG or pickup WoW again\u2026\n\n# 7. Thou shall accept that you cannot play everything.\n\nAs a hobby video games have the merit to be relatively inexpensive and to offer (way too many) hours of entertainment per dollar spent. That doesn\u2019t mean that you have to binge on everything that gets released. Choose the games you want to spend your time on carefully. Favor shorter experiences if you can and avoid things that you know will just be a waste of time.\n\n# 8. Thou shall not fall back on gaming as a habit or as a default pastime.\n\nDo not play video games just because it\u2019s easy or because you have no obligations that require your attention RIGHT NOW. Video games should be exclusively for your downtime when you\u2019re positively certain that you\u2019re on top of all your chores and responsibilities which includes the important responsibility towards yourself to self-develop and become a better human being.\n\n# 9. Thou shall avoid games that are overly repetitive and offer no meaningful experience.\n\nThis should be obvious. We\u2019ve all been there. If a game doesn\u2019t respect your time and you notice that you\u2019re doing the same mindless content over and over again. Stop it.\n\n# 10. Thou shall avoid games that base their rewards on excessive grinding.\n\nIf you actually consider video games to be a legitimate art form, it should be obvious that it should waste no time getting to the point: the meaningful experience. If you feel that the game dangles a carrot on a stick in front of you and denies you this meaningful experience it\u2019s not worth your time.",

But I started skipping school to play video games this year and have 50 absences in one of my classes, barely did homework, failing all my classes, I HAD friends that I usually hang out with but they\u2019re all gone ( either go to a different school or I don\u2019t see them anymore ). So with me not getting to see my friends ANYMORE and me being the shy, anti-social person that I am. Video games filled the void within me... I just started playing video games for a year now and clocked about 2k hours in warframe and 600 hours into overwatch. So... do I have a problem?",

I don't think I'm addicted as I only play about 2 hours or so a day max. But at the same time sometimes when playing and after playing I feel this sense of 'wasting your time'. Then, I say to myself that I'd probably be watching Netflix anyways so what's the difference? But this, nagging, what could life be like, what other hobbies or self improvement, life goals could I achieve if I focused energies away from a game ill play for 50 - 100 hours and then never pick up again? I barely watch 'normal' tv so I also use this as a way to rationalise that I don't have a problem because its just for a few hours anyways each day, the same as most people would watch movies or tv. But at the same time, I could be using this time for much greater stuff in life. Stuff that means and will create a better future!",

            "selftext": "So the last week has been a crazy ride and i've got some things i'd like to share about the \"recovery\" process from my perspective that could help some of you immediately quit and develop a better life for yourself. \n\nFirstly, i've tried to quit about 20 times in the past 2-3 years and not once was i able to successfully kick the habit.\n\n**What i did differently**:\nDownloaded an app blocking software called \"Cold Turkey\" and joined Potential Central on discord (essentially habit rehab and support group).\n\nhttps://getcoldturkey.com/\nhttps://discordapp.com/invite/UXGKyb3\n\nThese two things were what finally worked for me to kick the addiction, it might be different for all of you but please try something like this - that blocker isn't something you can just remove from your PC on a momentary urge, you pick websites and software to block and lock that commitment until a certain date.\n\nAt night i shutdown my PC via cold turkey option from 1AM (was 10pm - 4am but yesterday i decided that i'm in a good enough place to adjust that, for sake of my sanity). Night time is a hard time for urges in general so you might want to setup a block, besides you're supposed to be getting ready for sleep anyway!\n\n**Important Note** \n\nThings started feeling different after only 4 days for me, when you do something like this your discipline is going to skyrocket. I'm convinced that giving everything up (going cold turkey) is what really helps gaming addicts to drive away that addiction, i know for myself that whenever i'd try to quit gaming i was always just moving that addiction to browsing reddit... watching youtube... tugging my pleasure pole... wasting all of my time in life on wasteful activities. \n\nI'm not fully \"healed\" yet either, the Cold Turkey software is no longer on my PC and there's no restraints anymore - but, that discipline and direction i've been able to cultivate still remains and keeps me in check and now my time is honestly spent ; programming, habatica (habits gamified, join via potential central or KOA - i'm in the hard mode party on KOA). \n\nDon't believe the people that say \"You need entertainment to survive\", there's multiple forms of entertainment and that fact is that anything even on the internet is already un-natural as heck for your reward system.. go ride a bike, read a book, attend a social event in the real world! Develop real connections with people in the physical realm instead of the superficial one.\n\nAnyway, hope this helps some of you. I'm off to reinstall Cold Turkey for those garbage heap websites that there's just no use for (Facebook,Reddit too unfortunately - though ill stay long enough to read replies, Anime(pure fantasy and completely unrealistic), Manga (i liked reading this but it's still pointless just reading the same shit over and over - which is what i was doing with Goblin Slayer lol), Music (thinking of reintroducing some funky productivity shit to listen to, like very simple electro or equivalent - wouldn't call this a dangerous thing, infact it's actually art.. but for recovery it's a no IMO. Porn HAH).",

            "selftext": "6 months ago I left playing dota after having played it for 8 years. And now I started playing it again because I have no real friends and feel bored most of the time. please help me get through this phase of life. I am shit scared of doing anything like even writing this post. My English is all screwed up now and the fact that all my friends are well settled haunts me every second. My attention span is minimal... Max 10 min after which I get irritated. I have done my engineering and MBA in marketing but I feel I am totally useless and not good at anything in particular..It's like I am a jack of all trades but a master at none. I keep shouting at my parents for my own faults and yesterday I could sense my mom being scared of me. I used to be a good cricketer but due to some injuries, I could not continue doing it. I belong to a very traditional Indian family which follows some weird norms which I don't believe in totally. My body is totally out of shape and I have no self-confidence left. I feel I just did all those degrees to make friends and stay away from home at that I could play the games peacefully away from the constant jabbering of my parents. Any sort of guidance would be really appreciated.MY GOALS\n1.improve my written English\n2. Set up a business through which the society benefits and I make loads of money\n3.Learn about stock market and follow the steps f warren buffet.\n4. Stop being the introvert weird guy I am right now and be like a roaring lion with a positive aura.\n\nI've spoken my heart out and I feel really light after writing this post. You can criticise my English as much you want but boy at least I am trying to improve.",

            "selftext": "Hi guys. Bit of a ramble here.\n\nTL;DR: I want to game socially only a couple of scheduled times a week, but don't know how to make the change from defaulting to gaming every day to actually rebuilding good habits in my life on my own.\n\nI'm a second year college student right now, and, starting during my gap year, I have spent far too much time gaming. I didn't really play games in high school. I got really into games last year through my college friends, but then I transferred, and didn't make new friends. Instead, I have acquaintances, and gaming has replaced my other hobbies as my go-to free-time filler. I'm suffering academically and I have stopped sports completely, gaining weight and now being out of shape.\n\nI play Overwatch and Hearthstone, and I think I would consider myself addicted. I now play whenever I have any free time. I'm trying to be more physical, and work on other areas for self-improvement, learning, etc, but I find myself gravitating towards games or, failing that, the internet at large. I finally came to and read over this subreddit, and it [resonated](https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/7go2jh/depressed_gamer_starter_pack_too_real_crosspost/).\n\nDespite this, I don't view gaming as completely wrong or bad, and I don't want to quit altogether. I like the way it allows me to connect with friends I would otherwise lose touch with. More specifically, I started Overwatch with my close childhood friend, and he stayed in my hometown while I went to college abroad. I'd definitely like to tone down Overwatch to be more of a social experience a couple of times a week rather than an everyday default habit. \n\nThe posts here are, obviously, mainly to quit cold turkey, completely, forever. I get that, and I'm also open to alternative online hangout ideas. But I guess I'd mainly really appreciate tips towards more of a balance, or anything to develop and re-develop good and productive habits as I rebuild what I destroyed with my destructive and obsessive tendencies and habits.",

            "selftext": "Last saturday and sunday I spent both days holing up in my room playing dota 2. I am an \"addict\" trying to quit, I usually quit for a few weeks (sometimes just one week) and binge game over the weekend or when I have time (and have nothing to do and have no friends). \n\nThe thing is I don't crave.. I come back to dota 2 repeatedly because I have nothing better to do. My typical cycle involves watching dota 2 highlight videos on youtube, watch streams, then start playing.. But I start watching dota 2 highlight videos not because I crave playing the game, but because I have nothing better to do.. It is a very mindless activity, I can binge watch video after video, and is a very powerful method to destress. I think that is why I keep coming back to this... When I am stressed I watch dota 2 videos/streams..\n\nBut on the other hand, when I play, I play nonstop, from wake to sleep. I can't stop after I start playing, even when I feel it is no longer pleasurable. I also don't bother to eat or drink, and sometimes play until the next morning. But on weekdays, when I have stuff to do, I don't crave playing dota 2. \n\nIs this addiction?? Sorry for the repetitions and bad writing.",

I've b3een doing this for about 3 years and now I've realized something, it's ruining me at school because I \"have to\" grind currency so I can get the latest units people have been calling me phone boy or saying you only use your phone in class my lowest grade is a 93 and I'm talking all advanced or high school classes possible in 8th grade and I know it's not an excuse. People tell me that teachers have caught me haven't told my parents fortunately but they know students know and at times I'll feel like an outcast. Another problem with these gacha games is that eventually after playing them so much I'll get burnt out and download a new one and I finally realized something was wrong when I downloaded another one months ago and downloaded a bunch to see which one I liked the best. I'm now getting so addicted I just don't want to leave and I want to keep playing. It's impacted my sleep schedule so I'm tired all the time, I'm antisocial at times, and I can do so much with my time but waste it. Pls help me I've tried to delete them all but the next day I download them again so I don't lose my \"daily rewards\" or because of how long I've played. I want to delete them now but I always think about the time I've put into them. I have a huge dream of being a pro soccer player being better at the instrument I play and more but gacha games are hurting me. Sorry for this huge wall of text but I genuinely want to stop. \n\nThanks for reading.",

            "selftext": "  \n\nFirstly, I wanted to say that I am very grateful for this sub and the stories and advice that people post on here and I wanted to share my experience with video game addiction and how it impacted me personally.\n\nMy beginnings with video games started off as a fun and harmless activity, and I never thought it would be something that I would ever regret trying later on. My first contact with video games was playing old arcades and coming over to one of my friend\u2019s house to play on his older brother\u2019s computer. During my 9th birthday I received a PC as well as a PlayStation 2. At first, gaming wasn\u2019t a problem, I would always play outside with my friends as well as do okay academically. I mainly played adventure and fighting games on my PlayStation however later got more and more into playing strategy games on my PC. When me and my family immigrated to the USA I couldn\u2019t take my PlayStation with me, but I got to take my PC which, at that point, I was gaming on more anyways. While I was never bullied in school, I had serious trouble with fitting in and didn\u2019t speak English very well. When middle school started I felt that I was really behind everyone and had to catch up socially. (I was always a shy kid but mostly got along with others and had good grades). While I ended up making some good friendships and eventually learning English to a reasonable level, there was one thing which was slowly starting to have an increasingly negative impact on my life, gaming. During middle school my playtime started to slowly skyrocket. I had also gotten into online gaming and started to play more and more addictive and competitive games. First *Minecraft*, then *Call of Duty*, then *Battlefield.* While I didn\u2019t really think much of my habit I sometimes felt that I was wasting my time and should be doing something more productive like studying or going outside. I remembered one time when my cousin came over to my house. He was a pretty big gamer himself but even he was shocked at my playtime and dedication to games. The day that he was visiting I had played for 12 hours straight with the only brakes being for the bathroom and food. Whenever my dad would ground me he would do it by taking away my video games. Every time he gave them back to me he would remark that while he really wanted me to be happy and to be able to play and enjoy video games, he couldn\u2019t help but notice how much less irritable and more social I became when I wasn\u2019t constantly sitting in front of a screen.\n\nBy the time high school started I began to fall into a bit of a depression. My life was in a shitty situation at the time due to personal reasons. I had gotten accepted and gone to a very academically rigorous high school and lost contact to all my school friends that I had in the process. I had to also move to a new neighborhood which was in a new town and very isolated (it was mostly for old people, not a lot of kids to play sports with, which was a way that I hung out and made friends previously). Also, puberty started kicking in at this point and I developed a low self-esteem and was constantly moody and tired. I focused less on my school work and stopped playing sports or exercising.  I owned a PS4 but sold it and with some financial aid from my parents I was able to buy a mid-range gaming PC which I put together myself. I still remember how excited I got when I finally put it together and turned it on for the first time and immediately got to buying and downloading my favorite games. While at first, I played titles which I was familiar with, I started watching PC gaming YouTube videos and discovered *Counter- Strike Global Offensive*. At first, I didn\u2019t know much about the game and was bad at it, but I was determined to get better and made a big effort to improve at the game. I would spend hours after school practicing and training my aim and learning map knowledge and would watch tutorials on how to improve at the game.  I wasted most of my saved money on expensive peripherals which I thought would make me better at the game such as expensive keyboards and monitors.  When I would get back home from school I would immediately jump on *CS: GO* and play till midnight while ignoring the high amounts of homework and studying that needed to be done for tomorrow. I also stopped going outside and hanging out with my friends and rarely left my room. My grades took a big hit in high school with me going from a mostly an A-B student to failing most of my classes and getting a low GPA. While everyone else was busy with college admissions and getting the best grades that they could as well as having a social life, I spent my time sleeping through the school day, talking to barely anyone and playing CS: GO past midnight when I got back home from school. After the game went free to play I reduced my playtime due to the hackers and me getting more and more frustrated with having to play against them.  I don\u2019t play as much as I used to but now mainly waste my time on things like Twitch or YouTube videos watching other people play the same games that I do. I\u2019m currently a senior in H.S and graduation is nearing. I am unsure about my future and I am clueless about what I should do after school ends. I feel I have accomplished very little during this time and the countless hours that I spent on gaming resulted in nothing to show for.  I have bad grades, I\u2019m very undisciplined and lazy, and I\u2019m not very confident and social. I have trouble talking to girls and I\u2019m still a virgin. Besides trying to change and improve my life the thing I keep on doing is playing video games. Sometimes I will tell myself that I will try to change and end up uninstalling my games from my PC however I always end up relapsing due to boredom and cravings. The worst part is that I don\u2019t even enjoy playing that much anymore and gaming is beginning to feel like a chore, it\u2019s more of a thing that I use as an escapism method to distract myself from my problems and things I need to do.",

I quit all of it cold turkey, the stickler being runescape, a shitty mmo I was able to play on my 10 year old MacBook.\n\nOut of boredom at his house, I bought rocket league on his Xbox. Cost me $15 to play for a couple hours, it's not unlike going out and spending some cash on beers, right?\n\nI was reminded why I quit. I got so crazy into it, I tuned out the world around me. My ego got completely involved and I was reminded of how much my identity was based on gaming. I had an absolute blast getting back into Rocket League. I made sick plays, pulled off some dribbles, flexed on some noobs, got way into some ranked games. I'm a huge soccer fan, so rocket league let's me... feel vicariously like a star soccer player... honestly. And styling and pulling off some sick moves was my dopamine rush of choice in video games. \n\nBut I think I'm absolutely addicted. My friend subtly asked me if I didn't get bored of playing the same game over and over and then an hour later, subtly asked me if he could go to sleep.\n\nToday, I have a huge craving to play it again. I almost tried to make an excuse that I was sick while my friend went to go pick up his girlfriend at work. The plan was to pick her up and then go eat and in my head, I was trying to formulate a plan to have him go pick her up alone, come back and then take us to eat. That would've allowed me to have an hour or so of rocket league ecstasy. Replace rocket league with... idk, crack cocaine and it really does sound like an addiction.\n\nI'm buying a laptop to replace my gaming pc and I swear to you all there will not be a graphics card on it because otherwise I'll be back to gaming my life away.",

            "selftext": "\"Time enjoyed is not time wasted\"\n\nThis is generally the main argument raised against gaming. However, It in itself is wrong by assuming that the goal of life is to \"enjoy\".\n\nWhich brings us to the question, \"What is the goal of humanity\". While different religios beliefs can have different answers to this question, one of the most generally accepted theories in physchology states that the goal of life is to \"improve oneself.\" \n\nWe can see proof of this easily by looking at the history of humanity and technology, and how we have advanced our civilization further and further. Is science more fun than gaming? Not really, but still, we are here on this level of advancement because of the people who resisted spending their entire lives on \"enjoyable\" activities and focused on \"improvement\".\n\nBut then i ask the question, \"Are we going to spend all our lives working and improving without any joy\"? Not really. Humans, by nature, need to relax and have some fun. But however you do that, the activity must meet following criterias;\n\n* Hobby must not result in addiction\n* Hobby must have easy time-control (Watching anime for example, you know its going to be 24 minutes, easier the control)\n* Hobby must be time efficient, you must be able to relax enough in small time spans.\n\nGames for the most part, fails in these criterias, gaming does so very easily result in addiction, games are not easy to manage time, and games are very inefficient way of having \"joy\" since they ask for too much time for too little joy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven for the most time-efficient games,  such as For Honor and R6S , you do not necessarily have fun in the 30 minutes you spend at it, opposed to, for example, reading a high quality book that almost always guarantees joy. Or watching a high rated 2 hour movie, again, that guarantees alot of joy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you have managed to read all this, thank you for your time, these are not necessarily facts, but instead are my opinions on the topic, I would be glad to know whether you agree or not, and why /  why not",

            "selftext": "Having been thinking about gaming for a lot of the day.  I have been on Reddit and youtube to try to avoid it as I don\u2019t really know what else to do at the moment.\n\nI have read some tonight but am already tired of that.  I have been drinking more and more since stopping gaming and would really like to stop or cut back significantly starting next week.  Drinking kind of dulls the boredom I have been having but it is obviously not a healthy replacement for gaming, I am aware.\n\nI have made it to slightly over a month.  Have been having urges to binge game on the weekends.  I have been doing productive things the last few weekends but those productive things have also cost money.  \n\nI am currently trying to pay down my debts (Dave Ramsey style) and it is limiting the money I can spend on other hobbies.  I built a workbench last week that I felt fantastic about but the materials added up.  I also found a new hobby of trash picking the day before trash day around the neighborhood with my wife, which we find to be a lot of fun.  We aren\u2019t poor or anything but it\u2019s just exciting to see the things people throw away that I could make use of.\n\nThis is kind of a rant, but just wanted everyone to see where I am after a month of no games (this has also included no Netflix/movies/tv shows as well).  I am trying to make it to at least 90 days to see how I feel in the end.  I did not game a lot during the week, but would binge on the weekends and feel very depressed come Sunday hating life.  This was my reason to stop gaming.  Felt like I wasn\u2019t accomplishing anything with my life and knew if I continue down this path, how will I ever progress in life or be a good parent etc.  \n\nInside of me I feel so much more potential and things that I am capable of.  Sometimes I feel like I dull my mind with video games because I am terrified what my life will be without it.  \n\nBut anyways here is to a month free.",

Some excerpts:\n\n\"When I say all-in-one, I mean it. I tried to cover everything from realizing the addiction and downsides, preparing to quit and doing it, and the benefits, inspiration and 'hobby' ideas.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Technology is a useful, essential tool in the modern world - but only if used moderately. Although gaming has became a typical hobby, it's not a healthy habit, especially if overused.\"\n\n\"Quitting gaming is a big step, but it must be done when things get out of control. It will require great self-discipline, but once you hit rock bottom you can 'restart the right way'.\"\n\n\"Most people say they don't have anything to do. That's nonsense. With the right mindset, you'll realize there is so much you could be doing instead of needlessly staring at a screen.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"No exclamation marks were used in the making of this guide. \"\n\nThank you, see you soon. I am new here too, to both reddit and quitting gaming.\n\nThis guide is from everything I've seen here alongside me jotting down my ideas.\n\n:)",

            "selftext": "I sold all my gaming gear tree weeks ago and I feel amazing. I've started putting all the effort I put in video games to other things, such as learning to play guitar, going to the gym three times a week, learning a little bit of chess and actually putting effort in to school and prioritizing sleep hours and actual sleep quality. I've gotta admit, my anxiety and depression have relieved a lot after this change. I also needed something to replace the dopamine rush that video games kept giving me, so I'm currently seeking that feeling from studying, exercising and learning an instrument. So far it has worked nice. It feels like I'm doing something that will actually benefit me in life. And it has also increased my overall mood by a ton.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo how did I end up doing a 180 degree turn in my life? Last winter and not too long ago I was feeling super low, to the point where I would just play video games very late, sleep in and skip school. Being threatened to be expelled due to not finishing any courses at school is what actually hit me. I spent 10-14 hours on video games a day coping with my anxiety and depression which probably was caused by video games to begin with. Gaming prevented me from doing anything productive. On text this really sounds horrifying. They're only video games right? Well yeah, but they're designed to be addicting. The game keeps feeding you the continuous dopamine rush and sense of accomplishment, only to realize that those accomplishments don't really matter in real life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone reading this is even slightly in the same place where I was: Try to redirect the drive to play video games to something else that actually matters in life and benefits you. But the tricky thing is that the things I've started doing don't  really provide instant dopamine rushes, or results. So how do I deal with it? It gives you an overall better mood and self-esteem LONG TERM. And all I can say is that I prefer long term enjoyment more than short term.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've gotta admit that I've had cravings to play video games, and I've given up to them. I only have a laptop now and I've always hated \"gaming\" on a laptop. So when I really crave Runescape for example, I give in to it, just to play for 30 minutes and feel like it ain't the same. I'd say going from 10-14 hours a day to 30minutes is quite an improvement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't want to demonize video games, since they can be consumed in moderation too. But they are very addicting and can lead to an extreme case like mine. Video games become harmful when there's no other content in your life or you start prioritizing video games over that other content.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApologies for my English but it's hard for me to write long posts since it's not my first language. But this is good training!",

Until i finally realised this is not worth my time anymore, and i have wasted literally over 10 years of my life time for this shit. While other people were studying partying etc, i was sitting on my ass gaming and gaming and more gaming until i was tired and went to sleep, and lately it reached a point i didn't even fucking sleep but instead spend full night and little over morning playing this fucking game. Well thanks for out of my stupidity i gotten my main account banned and this was final nail in the blanket. I deleted all my fucking games from my computer and i plan to sell all this shit my other platforms too. Just being here and realise how fucking empty and sorrow my life is and feels, it's ridiculous. But i bringed this to myself and only me, nobody else to blame over this and this is my final word Fuck you for gaming.",

Now that I\u2019m older I mostly played games about 2 hours a week to unwind after work.\n\nThe reason I stopped is that our apartment flooded in January and amongst other things that we lost our video game console was part of it. Unfortunately our insurance did not cover water seepage.\n\nDuring all that stressful time we had to find another place to live and replace some things. The landlord was nice enough to pay for a hotel room. However, we couldn\u2019t stay there as our 4 year old is diagnosed with ASD and does not handle change well.\n\nForward 2 months and we hit a few more speed bumps, but settled in the new place.\n\nI will probably buy another console some day. However, I find myself being extra stressed after the work week. I can\u2019t seem to unwind. I tried exercise, picking up a hobby. \n\nI don\u2019t watch TV much, nothing really interests me there.\n\nAny tips for me?\n\nP.S. feel free to delete if it does not belong here.",

So much I could have done with that time I will never get back. The regret is unreal.\n\nI didnt intend to quit video games. It just kind of happened. My wife was surfing etsy looking at cool handmade decor and furniture. She really liked this wooden stove top cover and I'm a nice guy with a miter saw. So naturally I decided to try and build her one as a surprise. It turned out great and I kinda liked building it. I began slowly spending more time in my storage building that we now call the wood shop.\n\nThat's been about 6 months ago and now I have a lot more tools for wood working and I'm building a lot of cool stuff. I'm even making epoxy coated tables and selling them. I'm thinking about getting into the gym I'm not quite ready to make that commitment. But I am jogging a couple times a week and eating better. Reading a ton of books.\n\nI have so much free time to do productive things with and to spend with family. If you're thinking about hanging it up, do it! It's the best decision I have ever made. \n\nMuch love.",

However today a thought came across my mind that I think kind of fits this sub.\n\nDo you think that grindy behavior that some people have with video games could actually essentially be converted into a work ethic/stronger work ethic?\n\nLike, There's people who are more than happy to spend long hours on games just doing the same basic tasks over and over again to eventually get desired results. And I do sometimes wonder if that sort of patience and persistence could actually transfer over into something more useful in real life. Or if it's really just another aspect of addiction to video games.\n\nObviously I don't think it would be as extreme in real life of course, As games are definitely more convenient than work. Though I do wonder if the kind of basic mental habits kind of carry over...\n\nWhat do you people think? Sorry if this is a stupid question.",

A couple years ago I became REALLY addicted to League of Legends and Runescape to the point that I started having severe family, academic and health (physical and mental) problems. Thankfully I've greatly reduced my gaming time since but I still feel that I am gaming more than I should. I would love to focus on more important things in my life so recently I decided to completely quit gaming, however I feel so empty and it's made me super depressed. I'm having a very hard time emotionally because I gave up the very good friends I made while gaming and my real life friends neglect me. Even though I want to follow my life goals I feel like I have nothing to do now and I'm starting to think it was a mistake to cut my most loved activity (and friends) so harshly. I don't know if it's better to come up with a moderation plan to balance out mi activities. I would love to hear some advice from some people here.\n\nThank you for reading through my horrible grammar.",

            "selftext": "After about 2 years, I\u2019ve finally realized that I have an addiction to LoL. I always knew in the back of my mind that I was addicted but too afraid to admit it.\n\nThe moment I realized I was addicted was yesterday, I failed my math test because I had spent the night before playing league and not studying. Failing a math test doesn\u2019t mean that much buts it proof that league has been interfering with my life. It\u2019s actually been interfering with my life a lot actually. League affected everything, mental, physical, social, and academic aspects of my life.\n\nLeague was pretty much on my mind almost 24/7. I could be out playing basketball with my friends but would be thinking about how I\u2019d get to go home and play league. \n\nI\u2019ve tried to quit before but have always relapsed. \n\nSummer is coming up and I\u2019m afraid of wasting it playing league everyday. I can\u2019t say league had brought anything good to my life, it only trapped me in a vicious cycle of frustration and false sense of achievement. I had been completely happy before league, but now I\u2019m trapped and I want to be free again. \n\nI\u2019m going to send in a support ticket to delete all my accounts.   No more. I\u2019ll lose a bit of money but it\u2019s worth it. All this might sound silly but league has seriously been hurting me and it\u2019s time to stop. \n\nTldr league has been consuming my life and it\u2019s time for me to delete everything once and for all. I\u2019ll be free again.\nAlso\nSorry for ranting, I just needed to get it out. If you are an ex LoL addict, I\u2019d love to hear your story.",

            "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nJust wanted to say that 8 weeks ago I've deleted Dota and never came back to it. When I was sick, I played Auto Chess for like 5 times and felt really mad at myself, but didn't have the urge to play a single match of ranked. Even though my buddies constantly tell me about new meta and patches - I do not care to try it out myself!\n\nTo anyone that tries and bounces back into their addictive game, I can tell you what worked for me. I didn't quit gaming as a whole. Now, I play single player games like Witcher (yes, I haven't played it normally before) for an hour or two once every 3 days and it feels enough. If I feel really exhausted and want to relax with gaming - I play Witcher one day at the weekend for a bit more - maybe 3 hours. The results for me are great - 20 hours spent on Witcher during that 8 week period, compared to the average 40 hours of dota per week. I guess you can call that casual gaming, right?\n\nTo some people, quitting cold turkey won't work. Take it slow. It's the same as smoking - from a pack of a day to 10 a day to 5 a day and so on. Take those small steps!",

            "selftext": "So let me start off by saying, this was not an overnight journey or decision.  I have felt frustrated with gaming I think since 2017, 2018 I really took conscious attempts to remove it but failed/refused to quit and 2019 I can't really remember the last time I truly played a game.  \n\nI'll be honest I never really care for milestones and this one sorta just snuck up on me- tbh I don't care about this at all anymore but I haven't been celebrating enough wins in my life and I figure why not take the opportunity to acknowledge and celebrate this one by passing on my story to others.  Maybe you will gain insight or perhaps get a little bit more hope- whatever it is, I wish you well. \n\n**My background in gaming:** Poor kid growing up, but I managed to scrounge up enough for a Gameboy advance and honestly it became an escape ever since.  It was a firm part of my identity and I wouldn't have it any other way. Each year I would be excited for E3- I still remember the Modern Warfare 2 demo on stage- that was probably one of the most intense demos I remember. I moved on to Xbox because of a friend and that has been my home except for when the PS4 XBone fracas was happening and I switched to PlayStation for a year.  Came back to Xbox cause I was lonely on PS4 cause nobody else had it. I did get a platinum trophy in my time there.  Came back to Xbox but by this point, I think the first nail in the coffin was done. \n\nI remember trading in the PS4 for the Xbox Tomb Raider bundle and honestly, it was a distinct moment of cognitive dissonance. What am I doing ....\n\nIt just felt wrong- I had one machine that could play games perfectly and I'm about to fork over some cash for another one...\n\nWTF\n\n**2017:** \n\nBut then hit fall 2017, I'm not quite sure it was because of gaming but there was definitely some role played by it- I was failing university and facing a health crisis where I thought I could be dying or potentially going blind. Real life finally hit me and it was kicking my ass.  I also quit my job cause in retrospect I was a weak little bitch who couldn't handle mean coworkers. \n\nI also never played with more than 5-6 people. It was just the core group of us. I eventually had minor beef with them which caused me to play even less *even when I wanted to.*\n\nBut this I think this is when the thoughts really started to creep in- why am I doing this....\n\nAs I was failing, as my health was crumbling and everything was going to shit. Why. Why. Why. \n\nLet me be clear- I'm almost one hundred percent sure I was not a hardcore addict ( I gamed less than 15-20H a week at my peak but I think the time lost on sites like IGN or Youtube Channels is really where my downfall was- keeping up with gamer culture/news is honestly exhausting)\n\nBut that was still hours that could have been spent studying. Working. Training. Etc \n\nThe opportunity cost &amp; tradeoff guilt was really starting to kick in by 2018. \n\n**2018:** \n\nStill stumbling my way through failure in uni I kept gaming but I kept it at one hour a day. I don't remember much from the first half of the year but I think I did either a 30/60 day no gaming thing while I tried to pull up my grades. A sad wreck I was but blissfully ignorant by playing games- the last video game I ever finished and thoroughly enjoyed was around this time- this year in fact. \n\nThe Witcher 3: Complete Edition\n\nI will admit- as far as games go. This was a great one to finish on. I remember having a great time with it and honestly, it was marvelous getting lost in that world of true art. Some games really do surpass the category they are in. \n\nBut I also remember- that exact moment when the final credits rolled and you get dropped right back to Kaer Morhen at the fast travel post and thinking WOOOWWW - that really felt like an adventure/experience. But I scrolled over to my hours played stats- it was over 85H, I felt depressed right away. That's 85H that could have gotten me started on a brand new skill and become better than a total beginner.  Something that could have helped my life.\n\nI eventually started feeling Melancholy- why do I swordfight in videogames when I can sorta try it in real life and build strength,  why do I fish and collect herbs in Witcher when there are real fishes and herbs out here, why am I not making great relationships with strange &amp; unique characters right here in the real world, etc...\n\nI really really enjoyed Geralt's life.  It felt full, complete, and surprisingly real. I wanted to travel and see the regions of the world the game was based on like Toussaint( Italy &amp; France to my knowledge), I wanted to explore. \n\nFrom then on, the war on games became real. \n\n It became a quest to take my life back. It was probably June by this point and I had officially flunked out of Uni- more despair and grim sadness fell upon me- totally aimless, no meaningful work experience, and lonely, so, so lonely. \n\nI spent that summer exercising and going to a field and reading books while taking naps under a tree. I spent it time traveling in my head- I would look up at the tree and since the rest of my field of view of the surrounding city vanished, all I would see is the tree and the field was isolated enough that there were minimal sounds of cars- usually overtaken by the wind and I would pretend I was sitting under a tree in France or in ancient Greece- like a philosopher tanning in the sun. \n\nNow theoretically because the only thing in my Field of View was the branches of the tree(s) there was nothing saying it couldn't be a tree in the hills of France or Italy in any time period I want. A tree is a tree for most historical civilizations. So I would pretend I'm resting in the past and wonder what my life would be like in these eras. \n\nIt was silly but I think it prevented me from becoming depressed or truly mentally ill. \n\nI applied to a trade school immediately and patiently waited for admittance which thankfully I got. I had to get a job ASAP so I applied for a 1-year program and started at a new school- by this point gaming really felt like a why bother endeavor- I still had my oldest friends who gamed and once every 2-3 weeks MAAAYBE I would play with them.  I renewed my gold which expires in September of this year. It felt like such a waste honestly and I barely use it anymore.\n\n**Fall 2018:** \n\nI got back into classes and vowed I wouldn't screw this up. I pulled my GPA from less than 1.5 to a 3.3 GPA! While I will be the first to admit that the workload wasn't quite the same with 5 classes but I needed a win and man did it feel good. For the first time in a long time- I felt like I was in charge of my own fate. By this point, my gaming habits were dwindling and minimal at best.\n\nI still clung on to this so-called identity as a gamer from my deep psyche and childhood adoration. The throes of addiction were dying but they had one last punch still.\n\nI bought call of duty: Black ops and I played it maybe a handful of times and then quit. The same questions came back- only quicker and more impactful \n\nWHY AM I DOING THIS!!!!\n\nEven with friends- it wasn't worth it. I never played it enough to get good, only 1-3 matches casually with friends. It was good but not long lasting- my eyes had been opened a little too much to find the contrite escapism of videogames satisfying in any way.  I had also detoxed at least twice in 2018 to varying degrees- some 30, some 60.\n\nI wouldn't even call this semester activity as gaming, sure I technically engaged in the activity but it wasn't an attempt to escape- it was just the last gasp of an old psyche and never truly felt fun- it was a way for me to talk too friends and get out from the match and meet up in real life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**December 2018:** \n\nI GOT MY FIRST SIBLING.  I have been an only child my whole life and when I got to hold him for the first time- it felt real. I was not going to let this little guy down and I haven't meaningfully gamed ever since- once in a while in public there are gaming booths set up to enjoy on your lunch break- if a friend invites me to play some FIFA at those booths- that's alright with me, its in public and over in 15-20 mins and I move on with my life. \n\nThe thing with my family is there are no strong role models to identify with. My father is weak &amp; old, my mother is great but she's tired, and everyone else lives somewhere else- so I have taken it upon my self to be the best big brother I can be. To teach him everything I missed and that means getting my shit together foremost. \n\nWhile you might take your siblings for granted &amp; despise them, think of your future children- what type of man will be taking care of them, this we shall see...\n\n**2019:** \n\nI suppose the last nail in the coffin was the purchase of Black Ops but the real last nail was no free time once a baby arrives.  While going into second semester with Five classes and the hardest classes I've taken compared to the 2 easy As which boosted my GPA in semester one. I was worried- but I pulled my sleeves up and got to work- gaming meant nothing by this point.\n\nI was taking care of a baby when I got home and going to classes in the morning. The first 3 months of a babies life is hell in terms of sleep loss but I took it as a challenge from above- could I survive such a test....\n\nI DID. \n\nNot only did I help take care of that baby- I finished the semester with a 3.9 GPA including a 100% on a final essay(50% of grade)  which has never happened to me before. \n\nI start a new job right away in a few days time and even despite a recent personal failure of mine- I don't feel discouraged or depressed. More of a BRING IT ON! IS THAT ALL U GOT!!!\n\nI'm pumped and I finally feel like I got my mojo back. I'm still poor, somewhat lonely,  and have a lot of responsibilities but for ONCE in 2 years- I feel in control and no matter what- I will not be beaten. The world has not heard the last of me, this I can promise you\n\nHeres a bullet point lessons guide that most of you will skim automatically for: \n\n1. **It took me TWO YEARS:** This was not an overnight journey and I hope the detailed events disclosed revealed that. Keep at it. \n2. **Turn your life into a game honestly:** I'll be honest with you- I still wanna be like Geralt. So why sit on a couch- BECOME AS BADASS AS YOUR FAVORITE CHARACTER. Learn the skills they know (if possible, find modern equivalents) and get to it. Life is shorter than you think. \n3. **Switch to Film/Books:** I realized the biggest things I liked about gaming were the engaging stories. Movies can be just as addicting but they end in 2H usually and film study is honestly something I enjoy- I write essays on the movies I watch sometimes. Try documentaries- we honestly live in a very very fascinating world. Better than what any game can build. \n4. **I still get urges:** I don't think it will ever fully be beaten until like 5 years down the road when I've gotten a life together but there have been 1-2 occasions where I stare at an EB Games (Canada) and always say to myself- NOT TODAY. \n5. **I still own the Xbox:** But I defeated the demon- I use it to only watch films via blu-ray player(Im not buying a new one when the Xbox works fine lol) or Youtube lectures on stuff I'm interested in.  I still have the games installed even- I don't even flinch at it anymore.  I use it to remind myself of how far I've come and how much willpower I have gained. \n6. **How I honor games:** They were an integral part of my youth- to say I had no fun at all would be a lie. So I download gaming soundtracks and watch out occasionally for new games to get a peek at their soundtrack on Apple music. Reminds me of the best parts and still lets me move on gracefully. \n7. **Learn new skills:** This is how you keep the time flowing. No matter what. Always keep learning. I discovered MIT courseware recently and my god, with the hours I put into gaming I could be an unofficial MIT graduate in Math/Physic/whatever I choose by now. This is what all the super smart 16-year-olds are doing haha \n8. **Be in public spaces:** I love working in Starbucks now. I love seeing that in the outside world- people are living life and getting their shit together. I love reading Philosophy there- currently on the Dialogues of Plato. Even if you aren't talking to others- just be in that presence. \n9. **Define your goals and values:** Pick something big and audacious, it will take a lot of work to get there and you will need every minute you can get. \n10. **Start winning** I think gaming addiction comes from a fundamental lack of winning/achievements in life. No matter how small- count your victories and slowly but surely they will build. \n11. **Learn how to handle failure/Dark Futures:** You will fail many many times, that is life. What matters is getting back up and not escaping to bullshit again. No matter how bleak the future looks(trust me I know how rough it can get) - have a deeper strength that says- I WILL NOT BE BROKEN. Mindset is everything. \n\nI still have a LOONG ROAD ahead of me, I still need to: \n\n* Get my relationship game together\n* Find and build a stable career \n* Achieve financial independence\n* Travel \n* Work on my volunteering/doing good in the world \n* Be less lonely/more social (only half true now, I have way more people in my life but I would like more)\n* Work on my fitness, fashion, grooming a little more etc\n\nBut I'm not scared- I've only really been at this for 8-9 months.  No matter how many times I am knocked down- I will slowly get back up and keep moving forward. \n\nAlways remember: \n\n*Failure is inevitable, defeat is optional* \n\nYou are being given a test my friends, good luck!",

As a kid playing a game called 9dragons I was 14 at the time I had amazing memories and had amazing friendships in a game and it was probably the best feeling and dopamine rush I ever had . Fast forward I\u2019m 19 and I\u2019m trying to quit the game and everytime I think about that game it brings that inner kid in me and right now I\u2019m trying to quit the game because I had so many friendships in this game and that\u2019s the reason why I played the bonds and stuff but like being aware of it now the reasons why I quit ( I quit this game prob 10 times already and always come back) because of the memories and bonds I had but now looking at it the friendships feel fake in my head because if you let\u2019s say we\u2019re so consumed in this game and then 3 months pass by and your friend needs to quit and he lives on the other side of the country in my head I immediately get bored and quit and it\u2019s the constant repeat that I finally found out why I keep coming back .. I\u2019ve experienced it everytime I played and now I\u2019m telling myself it will happen again and it\u2019s better to go away now then wait 3-6 months till something like this happens . Games that aren\u2019t in your control but playing because of your friends coming back isn\u2019t it for me and I finally realized that today . Now I need to take the appropriate decision and figure out how to go away from this game and focus irl because that\u2019s the sad truth about games in general and I finally realized that today ... anyone else experienced this same feeling I get because I feel like I\u2019m the only 1 when you play a game spend so much time with playing with friends and if they quit then you quit and etc thanks for listening",

I think it would be a good idea to brainstorm hobbies that are analogous to the different variety of  things people enjoy about games.\n\nIf you enjoy exploration parts of games, I would recommend hiking ( day long hikes are awesome ways to explore), I would recommend traveling, and talking to random people about their lives. Reading is also a great way to explore new worlds, there are extremely well written education books about the world. \n\nIf you enjoy the competitive parts of games, I would recommend sports ( specifically I recommend racketball and tennis). \n\nIf you enjoyed the social aspects, my preference is to smoke marijuana with strangers (if its legal) . I've made quite a few of my friends just by smoking with them.\n\nObviously incomplete, just trying to think of some things to throw at the wall. Please list any ideas you guys have for hobbies.",

I just came back from a trip overseas to visit family at friends and now realize that I wasted a good portion of it fantasizing about playing games. It is crazy to me how gaming consumed me without even knowing. Here I was on an amazing vacation and I chose to think about something that honestly does not offer any true benefit in the grand scheme. Sure it may entertain me briefly, but over the long term, I can't find balance. The time I spent gaming was time gone from playing with my daughter or learning my wife's native language. I squandered a good portion of my vacation but I came to the realization that I need to make a change. Lucky for me, I am going back overseas next month for the birth of my second daughter and I have a second chance to change and take a different approach. \n\nI wanted to say that a lot of the posts on here really helped me put things into perspective. It is also nice to be surrounded by people who are supportive and are willing to reach out and help. Thank you.",

            "selftext": "Hey guys, in case you don't wanna read the whole thing, basically I'm wondering if I should also cut out Youtube/Anime/shows/Reddit as well as gaming, because I tried to limit my time gaming (e.g 1 hour a day), but my time has been filling in with those other activities and I don't know if there is even point to committing to 100% gaming detox, or if I just need more discipline to cut those other things out too.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nShort Tldr of my background (Skip this if you don't want the details):\n\n* *Shitty upbringing where my family emigrated to UK from PL because poverty struck us hard.*\n* *Dad was (and still is) a gaming addict, who introduced me and my brother to gaming.*\n* *I've been an avid PC gamer since I was 6 (Got HOMM3 for bday....thanks for the addiction uncle xD) Been through it all... mmorpgs (Wow&lt;3), RTS, Fps, Minecraft, League etc.*\n* *As the years went by I got heavily into other mediums like youtube, reddit, social media (im surprisingly outgoing), anime and books.*\n* *In my last year before ending 2nd level school, for about a month or two i kinda unconsciously stopped everything (probably cause of the pressure) to focus on exams...got 2nd highest score out of my year (low-key proud).*\n* *Ever since I've become aware (especially when feeling the constant urges throughout my studies) that I am addicted to escapism and gaming.*\n* *Year later, im finishing first year uni with 3.5 GPA (which I know is good, but I can do better).*\n\n**Now, the important bits xD**\n\nI attempted to do a **dopamine detox** at start of April until exams are over.... basically gave up anything fun, to focus on studies like I did last year unconsciously...However after a week I was mentally drained and although I did a lot of work, I spent the whole weekend binging anime and youtube. \n\n**Now a month later, exams are done and I've been reflecting how to self-improve.**\n\n**The Issue I have right now is that I have all the habits set and prepared for me....I wake up at 5 am everyday, plan my day, go for a morning jog, comeback, eat and then go online....and from there, I do nothing all day, I just can't make myself do anything productive once I'm caught on a binging spree.** \n\nHonestly, the last game I think I was properly addicted to was League, but (apart from my dad/brother asking me to take over for them, cause they need to do something) I haven't played it since the detox, and had no urges to.... uninstalled it and all... I still get massive urges to play games, mostly single player like DAO or TotalWar... But I get bored after like 4 hours of playing and shut it off.... Only to go back to it a few days refreshed and repeat cycle.\n\nI spend the time in-between on youtube/reddit/anime.... I recently switched my smartphone to a Blokia and it is working, but kinda impractical (social life etc.)...and I still have my laptop which i need for work/studies. I made a habit of watching something while I eat, so it's hard to not get caught in the cycle of instant-gratification.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo to summarize, I guess what I need advice on is if my problems stem from my gaming issues or is it a general lack of discipline, and therefore do I need to cut out not only gaming but youtube/shows/internet etc. In a way I feel like from seeing my Dad,brother and reading this subreddit, I've become less and less addicted to gaming (even tho I used to be 100% addict), so I'm not sure if it's just my mind trying to trick me to not commit to this detox **(especially now, with summer that I have lots of spare time, and I know I will be bored)**, or if i geniunely don't need it  and gotta discipline myself more.\n\nThanks guys for the long read, looking forward to any advice to improve!",

It goes without saying, that this is a sensitive issue and is difficult to talk about so I would appreciate anyone willing to reach out. We are still early in the process and want to gather as much information as possible so we can explain this to a broad audience in a responsible and accurate way. If you are willing, I would like to chat over the phone about your own or your kid's ongoing struggles and how difficult it can be. All would be confidential at this stage (as our only published work is via on-camera interview) If you comment or message me, I can give you my email and more info. Best, James",

Needless to say, I\u2019ve always patiently waited for summer to come around so that I can spend all day, everyday playing competitive online multiplayer games. \n\nWell now I\u2019m 23. Sold my ps4 a few months ago (October 2018).  I have 5 more credits to finish my bachelors in computer engineering so this is technically my last summer as a student.  It feels weird not planning to throw away my summer playing video games but I\u2019m finally free to use this time to improve myself. I can make my own C++ project and make even more gains in the gym. The possibilities are endless. \n\nThe old version of myself couldn\u2019t even fathom the thought of quitting video games.  I was planning on having it a part of my life until at least 30. Wow that sounds sad when I think about it.  If I can do this shit, I know ya\u2019ll can too.  Good luck to everyone on their journey for self improvement",

            "selftext": "Hey guys, this is my first post here,\n\nSo I've quit video games about 3 months ago, after seeing that in the past 4-5 years they haven't brought as much enjoyment to me as they did when I was a kid. I've tried to get back to it here and there but couldn't really enjoy it and just preferred to read a book or listen to music.\n\nMy problem is that I don't really have anything non-professional to do in my spare time. I tried to watch some netflix but it didn't give me the same enjoyment I had from video games 5+ years back. Also currently I live in a rural area with not a lot of people my age so my only friends are from high-school, and all they're interested in is basically video-games and the media.\n\nAny advice on what to do here?",

            "selftext": "Since someone mentioned MCU in this sub, I want to talk about the hype since there were lots of hype for the MCU everywhere. Marvel was able to generate that kind of hype for End Game because the MCU spanned 22 movies over the past 11 years and they have build up a Universe adore by millions of people world wide and of course the previous movie (Infinity War) that ended in a cliffhanger so viewers would want to have a complete experience. It is 11 years worth of anticipation building up into one big expectation plus all the massive marketing, ads, celeb interviews, trailers. It is easy to get hyped for End Game. Hmm, reminds you of a certain strategy the gaming industry is extremely notorious for isn't it? A.k.a, the hype machine. Well, the hype isn't bad a thing consider Marvel's track record but the hype machine is absolutely brutal in the gaming industry. \n\nHowever certain games are nothing but glorified hype machines selling hype to blind and loyal fans. To do that, they release fake trailers and misinformation to trick fans into thinking the game is going to be awesome. The devs know they will sell millions of copies even when the game is terrible based on the brand name, hype and marketing alone. So,they simply push out a low effect game to reduce overhead costs and still make a profit. \n\nI was an idiot who fell for the lies and deception of a dishonest developer, lost quite a fair bit of money because of the hype and buzz generated by all the fake trailers and information. The worse part? I was so disappointed by that game and it gave me depression. I waited years for a masterpiece that was promised and got a piece of turd instead. I was broken, shattered. It took me weeks and lots of venting on YouTube for me to finally get out of the depression. \n\nThe biggest take away I have from years of falling into this damn hype machine was to never have any expectations for anything. It is certainly funny I had zero expectations of End Game at all whilst everyone was saying just how great it will be. I feel like the odd one out LOL.",

Answer is very obvious here try to not let all those shiny effects distract you from the fact that majority in this reddit thread is delusional and try to force their own mindset towards others.\n\n Majority of this thread community are Casuals in general it has NOTHING to do with playing casually; and everything to do with an anti-competitive and very carebear mindset. Competition, improvement and \"tryhard\" are the  things seen as hardcore and evil. Silly fun is good and casual.\n\nThey'd rather roleplay as great than actually be half decent. However -  anyone  playing competitively actively shows them that it's just roleplay. Hence you're a threat to their immersion which makes them go  full  REEEEEEEE.\n\nThe thing is that  since this group is a minority, they impose this playstyle on everyone  into the game and society quite aggresively. Whenever confronted with people not  agreeing,  they'll block report cry toxicity and elitism and go full  reeeeeee it's  just a gaem. This is required to keep up their illusions  of grandeur  despite an opposite reality and this is just sad situation how this \"StopGaming community is given up casuals frauds who realised they are not real gamers and only plays what is trending and is popular and believe fake reviews..",

            "selftext": "My gaming rig finally died around June of 2018. It was about 7 years old, so it was no surprise.\n\nI sat down and planned out a new gaming rig and ordered the parts. This new computer was going to be a dual-bot machine: running Win7 for games (and drivers to a printer &amp; scanner I use frequently) and Linux Mint for everything else.\n\nBut I inadvertently ended up buying the one ASUS motherboard with no Win7 drivers for the USB ports. As I didn't have the time to send it back and get something else (because I also use my computer for my art business), I said \"fuck it\" and went 100% Linux.\n\nNow I know that Linux has various means of running Windows games, but I sat down and started thinking: I've been playing video games since Xmas day 1976, when we got Atari Super Pong for Xmas. I've been playing video games for over 40 years!\n\nSo I put together my Business-Only work machine (and kept an old laptop running Win7 over in the corner for when I need to scan or print), and bought a guitar instead. Note that a brand-new basic Dean electric guitar is $199 with free shipping(!)\n\nI joke with my wife that I went from Arma 3 to Guitarma 3. And you know what? It's a lot more fun. I can play in any room of the house and not be stuck in front of my monitor for hours at a time.\n\nAnd the chords/fingering exercises for guitar are no more difficult in mastering than all the controls for vanilla Arma 3. Hell, I even dusted off my old keyboard and am relearning piano as well.\n\nSo! If you're stuck playing video games because you don't know what else to do with your free time, consider a musical instrument! It's just as fun and I've got a lot more freedom now.",

            "selftext": "Hello guys,let me present. My name is Alex, I'm from Romania and I have 19 yrs old( 20 in September) \nI started to play videogames in 2004-2005, I don't remember exactly, but nevermind, my first game was NFS Underground 2 untill 2008. I had a neighbour which used to play Counter Strike in 2007 and I started to learn from him, I went at tournaments in the real life when I had like 13-14 years, but I quit playing that game cuz CS GO was launched and people stop playing Cs 1.6.\nAnother game, I was supposed to play the Last time \u00een January 2019, is a MMPORG game called Metin 2,I used to play this everyday to get some money from that game,like 8-9 years.\nI used to play League of Legends too, I start on 6 th May 2015 and that's the reason why I want to quit forever gaming, I'm good at this game too, I hit Master tier 2 times the Last season and this month ( on EUW and EUNE), but I feel like is not funny anymore, I have to finish the high school the next year and I need to start to learn for the University.\n\nI don't smoke, I don't drink, I haven't past addictions, but I admit it, I got gaming addiction and this almost destroyed my life, cuz I spent like 15000-20000 hours playing games, that's equivalent of 250-300 days togheter.\n\nI want to change my life and I need some tips, because it's hard for me to change this habit and I relapsed every time when I was trying to give up and quiting gaming, I dont know, maybe I dont have ambition or I'm very addicted, seriously.\nI would apreciate every reply, advice, tip. I couldn't find another place to express this. \n\nHave a great day, Reddit community",

Now I feel quite... free. Even playing a single game I feel free! Not stressed, pissed, etc. I even when bored in a single game I easily quit. So, competition some kind of a drug. Social webs also addicting, like competitive gaming. I guess, if you wanna quit games \u2014 stop playing multiplayer. I also marked, that if I play alone \u2014 I play for a day, even with doing my other things. So, I guess the main point to return to yourself or something like that. Single games, as for me are not that harmful, like multiplayers. Still, multiplayers can be also, like Dead Space 3 \u2014 you play for a day or two with your peer and later quit, so nothing serious. Something like that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSocial webs are a wormwhole, which consumes you. I assume it's better not to speak with others in social webs at all. Got a phone? Got a number? Go outside, it's more productive. Not speaking in chats or other crap. Social webs sometimes like a... whorehouse or something like that. You see these pages and see not people, but imitation of a person, nothing else. Also, privacy is lost. Ironically, that it is called a web. Remember, how web is used in other circumstances? Yeah, catching fish. And fish is caught. In the Internet.",

I usually workout 6 times a day but recently i injured my sturnam and i had to take a break from exercise. When i stopped i needed a good thing to keep my mind distracted and from the pain so i naturally booted up my fav game of all time, Skyrim. After playing for 1 month while injured and developing depression as a result i started comparing our world to the world we see in Skyrim and i only keep finding reality boring in comparison. For exemple adventures in our world are usually stuff such as Himing Kayaking or Mountain Climbing while in Skyrim adventuring consists of fighting dragons, exploring crypts and ehat not. What's worse is that i have a habit for downloading companion mods that feel like real people and one of my mods sometimes says things such as \"I can smell adventure everywhere! This land is full of it.\" Which only adds more salt to the wound. How do i get a better outlook on life and quit my addiction? I know how pathetic this all sounds but bare with me because this is what i genuinely feel like. It wasn't always like this (it was the opposite in fact.) But i just need to get this mindset out of my head.",

            "selftext": "Hello All,\n\nI've been lurking on this sub for awhile. I've been trying to understand video game addiction and I'm still baffled. I was hoping to gain some insights from people who are self aware and mindful about their video game addiction. I've had a few friends get lost in the abyss of video game addiction and I don't know how to have compassion for them because I don't understand it.\n\n To say I'm not a gamer is an understatement. While I can play old school games (i.e. before game developers started actively trying to exploit the dopamine loop) I don't understand the appeal behind modern gaming. To me, it's not just a waste of time but also a huge waste of money. The downsides to video games is super obvious to me.\n\nSo my question for gamers, are you aware of the downsides while you are addicted to video games. Or is there denial and rationalizing of, \"this is just a hobby, nothing wrong with having a hobby\". Or are you oblivious to the effect video games had on your life until you hit rock bottom? Or was it a apathetic, \"I know I should quit but for right now I'm not hurting anybody\". If you were oblivious to being addicted what was the catalyst that made you rethink video games?",

This is especially problematic given that I'm in the middle of finals for my senior year in college and in the middle of law school applications. \n\nIf anyone has tips for people starting their first day please comment on this post.",

My main problem is that I don't really have anything else to do with my time.  Especially in the evenings when I'm not really feeling like doing anything too active.  I pretty much always filled my time with video games since I was a kid so it's not like I have a hobby to 'go back to', and I'm not a huge fan of T.V. or reading or several hours at a time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo Pretty much I'm asking for suggestions (more specifically evening activities, though all suggestions are welcome)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Thanks in advance",

            "selftext": "I never really considered myself as having an addiction, tbh,but lately it seems that my focus issues could be stemming from playing video games. Mainly I am looking for insight into this. If anyone here has had similar problems. \n\nSo at the beginning of the year I discovered a game that I got really attached to. This is very rare, as most games I don\u2019t really attach to. I\u2019ve noticed I have been playing more often, esp during times where I should be doing other things. I\u2019ll make excuses. My mindset is like \u201cI could/should be playing right now\u201d. When I should be studying, my mind somehow convinced me that gaming is more important and that I\u2019m wasting my time studying. I literally believe this on some level and it\u2019s become scary. Especially since I\u2019ve been having trouble sitting down and studying the subject that I love. I want to get better, I want to study, but I can\u2019t find the focus or motivation.\n\nStudying has never been easy for me. I find it dull and boring, and usually have to drag myself through. This is the case even for my passion, drawing. Its very hard for me to sit down and go through study materials and skill development. My problem is I\u2019m not sure if gaming compounds the issue, or if I\u2019m just really terrible at studying. I\u2019ll sit down to get started and find myself thinking of all the distractions I could be indulging in, gaming primarily. Usually, considering the difficulty in studying, the excuses usually win out and I lost yet another day to pointless distractions.\n\nSadly, even if I quit video games, I think I\u2019d just use other distractions to keep me from doing what I should be doing. I have no clue why I\u2019m so avoidant of working and studying but I am. I also really want to change, but I dont know how. If I force myself to cut out all distractions,I wind up experiencing strong feelings of loneliness, loss and anxiety. Feelings of fomo, if you will - like there are better things I could be doing - those better things usually being activities where I\u2019ll get rewarded faster (like watching you tube videos). But that\u2019s irrational, ridiculous.\n\nWhat\u2019s wrong with me? Why do I find it so hard to sit down and study a subject that I supposedly love? Do you have issues studying? Has gaming caused some of this somehow?",

Coming home, I had nobody to speak about it and so I dived into games to not further think about it. I did no homework and stopped learning wich gave me stress with the teachers wich made stress for my mother who stressed me again, so I played even more. First on a gameboy, later gamecube, then Computer and with the internet coming to our home I was finally completely addicted.\nThis circle of lonelyness, selfdistraction and confusion went on until end of school. I blamed everything for my mistakes, but not me and so I moved to another city to start university there and be finally \"free\". But of course things don't work that way. I was still playing up to 8 hours per day and when I dropped out of university for the first time, I started drinking, smoking and partying. I did anything to not feel myself. \"Friends\" of me did the same, not that extreme, but still a lot, but somehow they managed to have success and progress in their life while I was stucked.\nThree years after school I played the whole day, filling gaps with pizza and youtube lets plays, sleeping twelve hours, starting the day with a joint. I was completely down.\nI then somehow managed to meet the girl of my life, stopped smoking weed and drank less, but from that point on it it took me three more years until I completely stopped gaming (and drinking).\n\nAfter my fail in an education training last year, I realized I have to change more drastically. So I started a therapy last June wich took about three months in total. I met so many people with similar problems, I learnt that not all problems are caused by addiction and that for problems I have, others might have solutions. It's \"just\" important to start speaking about them and be open and grateful even and especially for critic, people who say what they think, because else life can be a circle with no exit. \n\nI played 17 years long, with a ingame time of at least four years, droped out of 2 study courses, one training, multiple jobs and lost a lot of friends and money and surely much more if I think hard enough. \nSurely it's not everything because of the gaming, but I can't ever find out, because gaming and addiction was always part of my life.\n\nNow I learn to accept my situation and my past, living with my gf, she moves to me in november, studying again, having a better link to my family and some close friends.\n\nThere is still a massive hole in my stomach and I am struggling with a lot of things, like making choices or getting things done, but at least I AM making choices and live with the consequences instead of burying my head in the sand. I am still at the very beginning, but hopefully someday I will look back and I will be proud of what I have achieved.\n\nThank you for reading. \n\nI am sorry though for my bad english and the text block, but I hope someone might find hope, inspiration or even motivation in this story to make a step forward in his life.\n\n\n Tl;dr I played a lot, lost a lot, changed a lot and now I live a lot.",

            "selftext": "Found this sub and mainly posting because I suck at quitting. I am naturally a very competitive player and DOTA2 filled that niche. Got to top 500 in SEA after 6k hours. Although I already knew I was playing too much I only tried quitting at 4k hours and 5k hours (these milestones were big realisations that I'm spending too much time on gaming). But I always ended up installing again mainly because I had nothing else to do, school was uncaptivating and my grades didn't really suffer. Quitting is a running joke with my friends and family and I really want to be serious this time. I am trying to quit cold turkey (reddit, twitch, steam and dota2 squad). It's the first time I think I genuinely want to quit. Would welcome any tips from people that successfully quit games like dota after repeatedly installing/uninstalling (it is worse than drugs for some people).",

            "selftext": "Hi folks, sorry in advance if this seems rambly.\n\nI have chronic fatigue syndrome (and possibly an autoimmune condition, based on recent labs) and haven't been able to to work for over 1.5 years. I also have an anxiety disorder, and bipolar 2 disorder that started off as a depressive disorder. In a nutshell, I have a huge problem with inflammation that affects me cognitively, physically, and emotionally.\n\nFrom the time I got my first computer in 1998 through 2006, computer gaming was more or less a problem for me. I used gaming to distract me from pain, to drown out the unpleasant emotions I didn't know how to deal with. In the intervening time, I've come a long way in learning how to cope with and process what I'm feeling, and my self-awareness is much better, so I'm less vulnerable to addictive behavior now than I was back then (but certainly not immune).\n\nDuring the time I've been disabled, I've taken up gaming again because it seems like there's not much I'm able to do with my time. I go out to walk for 10-20 minutes most days for exercise, and I can do chores around the house, but I can't even work a part-time job. I'm not a big TV-watcher, and I just haven't had much desire to read, so I needed something to fill up the hours. It's been a struggle just trying to fill out the admission forms for the rheumatologist I'm seeing next month, and just thinking about the social security forms I need to finish is overwhelming.\n\nIn addition to some more casual games, I've been playing WoW on a private server, and had progressed to end-game content with my main character, but I was struggling to be competent in my role. My brain just wasn't working well enough to play my character well, or to learn what I needed to do to improve. I haven't done any serious playing for over a week, and yesterday, after a few days of thinking about what I could change to improve my situation and bring some meaning into my existence, I felt like I was spending too much time being entertained by electronics, and that I needed to take a break at minimum, and probably make some long-term changes to my behavior.\n\nYesterday, uninstalled the games from my phone and PC, and I didn't watch any TV. I napped a lot, and by the end of the day, I was very irritable. I was very annoyed at my wife for no good reason. I didn't sleep well overnight. I know dopamine deprivation can cause this, but it still sucks. I'm hoping to avoid most, if not all, entertainment by screens for a week, then re-evaluate what I can allow. I think I need to keep games off my phone for longer, if not indefinitely; it's too easy to check out from what's going on around you when you have those available.\n\nI think that the combination of mental exhaustion from playing a challenging (for me) game like WoW and the \"quick fix\" instant gratification of easy phone games is wrecking what cognitive ability I've retained through my illness, so I hope that eliminating electronic gaming will reset my brain.",

            "selftext": "I started playing from the day it was released. And because I love Pokemon I played the mobile game everyday. I got really into it, running around catching pokemon in the world, doing raids and grinding for hours. But it got to a point where every time I was outside I would be looking at my phone trying to improve my position in the game, rather than enjoying just being outside. And it was also just not fun anymore. The game schedules exclusive events that were starting to feel like control trying to take attention of my daily life and schedule. And there are also many, many daily tasks and rewards to attract users back to the game, which also felt like daily chores.\n\nSo yesterday I thought to myself, I'll not open the app. I'll take it off my shortcuts and unsubscribe from all the news and subreddits related to the game. And I made it. I did it. I don't feel sad or like I've lost anything of value. In fact, I feel like I'm in control again. The game is not fun for me. And that part of me that would drop everything for the game is gone. I had an EX raid scheduled today, which is another of these scheduled events where you must be in one place at a particular time, and I just don't feel like going. So I'm not.\n\nI'm grateful for the memories the game has given me. And the fact it got me out and about with friends (acquaintances). But that's where it should have stopped. I put too much focus on the game, rather than enjoyment, and that's not a good thing. I'll keep keeping my distance from the game, and I hope I can do a whole week without opening the app. Then maybe one day I'll be able to do a month, and then just stop thinking about it. The 'investment' I put into the game is worth nothing anyway. They're just bits and bytes on a server somewhere, and the only part I want to remember is the first few months when the game came out.",

I'm now 22 and have a great life, a great job and I'm about to buy a house. Years ago I never thought I'd have much of anything. I don't even think about gaming anymore or think about playing it. I played some GTA about a year ago and couldn't play for more then 15 minutes without becoming very bored of it. I think finding something your passionate about besides gaming is one of the key elements to getting over the addiction. Sell your xbox/playstation or just break the damn thing. Or if your able to (I know I wasn't) maybe limit your time spent gaming to maybe an hour a day. Life is an amazing ride, don't look back on your life when your old and realise how much time you wasted. My cousin is addicted to gaming hardcore and it's sad to know all he does is smoke weed all day and game... he's wasting his youth. I'm not trying to come off as preachy or egotistical, I'm not perfect, nobody is. Good luck guys, I know you all can do it. I also think a lot of gamers have anxiety or depression, that's what I was using video games for, to numb/avoid those feelings.",

            "selftext": "Why did gaming get more important than real life for me? I guess there are many factors but a major one is the way progress works or more exactly how it works differently than real life.\n\nIn real life progress is mostly linear. Sometimes you even have minor or even major improvements but for most of the time it is linear, whether it's a skill you're practicing, you working out, you getting a raise, your relationships or friendships improving and so on. Many times in real life you actually can fail and failures really have consequences, unlike gaming, where you can always start over. In real life you will never be able to \"start over at 10 years old\" and rebuild your life. But that would be another subject to be discussed.\n\nWhat i want to concentrate now on is just the actual feeling of progress. In games progress is exponential. Yes, in later stages of a game it stops being exponential technically as in you don't advance as quickly but there's always ways to improve your progress rate.\n\nSo fundamentally it's the progress rate that i think gets us hooked.\n\nI mentioned \"buffs\" in the title because this is what i consider variable progress rate comes down to. It's a manipulation of our reward system into getting more and more and then some more because we got more in the first place. I use \"buffs\" as a generic term where it means anything that will modify your progress rate. Usually it's an \"active buff\" that makes you level up, get loot or whatever faster, but passives/skills and even equipment are, i think, in essence, \"buffs\".\n\nIt might seem this is mostly RPG related but it really isn't. Even a strategy game or heartstone or most of the games work on the same principle. The rate on which you can \"advance\" is much, much faster than in real life and it can be manipulated by you to go even faster. Things can get even more complicated when you start mixing them. Whether it's a \"build\" of a character and items, or a new building for manufacturing or a new skill, or a new car, or a new car part, or that card you needed... you can do so much to \"optimize\" your progress and make it faster.\n\nWhat you end up with is an artificial way to getting not only a feeling of progress, but a feeling of progress so powerful it can't be replicated by real life. \n\nWhat you end up with is your personal exclusive access to your brain's reward system when it comes to progress, something your brain is designed to reward. You can short circuit it and get rewarded for \"more and more\" because it thinks it really gets \"more and more\". And it actually does, it's just that it's meaningless.",

I know books and movies are one way, but maybe not more productive than games. Are there still ways to enjoy the epicness of fantasy and fiction?",

I always prioristised study or work over games and It's never interfered with my responsibilities, but I find it a ***huge*** time waster and would like to further use my time more wisely.   \n\n\nI sold my PC last year, but fell back into it 4 months later. In that four months I found myself more interested in other things. Hiking, reading more books and articles, researching new sports like diving, etc. I never really even touched my PS4 that I had in those four months even thought it's a \"gaming\" console. Tbh it's used more as a Netflix and Music box than anything else.  \n\n\nI'm new to the subreddit and wondering if people have quit entirely or just minimized there time with gaming? For example, no games becasue of addiction or some exceptions such as giving up PC and occaccionally using only one console? Do you make exceptions when going over to a friends house or maybe you're at a party and people are playing drunk Wii Sports (obviously other things to do at a party)?\n\nShould I keep the PS4 after selling the PC or is it something that needs to be gone as well?",

            "selftext": "Since I completely quit videogames last summer as they were holding me back from the progress I was making in real life, my life has progressed so far, it's unreal and I'm in a great position! \n\n- I have proper connections with friends and have met amazing people who I am open with and can talk to about anything\n- I have become much more attractive, gaining over 15 kilos of muscle and my skin complexion has improved greatly. I sleep a lot more, am not embarrassed about my hobbies and get attention from the opposite sex a lot\n- I am extremely sociable, I talk to people and feel like a properly integrated part of society\n- Academically, I am smashing it, I average a top grade at University due to free time and hard work, have learned 2 new languages on a basic level of communication, learned scientific and teaching skills all in my free time. \n- I have improved relationships with my family , I love them more than ever and don't argue all the time due to the Video games. Anyone who's played knows exactly what I mean. \n\n\nIn general, life is amazing, and I had some new friends invite me to play videogames for a couple hours with them but i couldn't, as I have given it up until I am old and can't really move any more. I want to reclaim the years of my life and I'm starting with my degree. Nothing will stop me now! \n\nQuitting will honestly change your life, and when you find new, productive hobbies, you will feel like a changed person! Huge respect for all of you fighting the struggle, and thanks for being here for support! &lt;3",

            "selftext": "So this is my story of how i from 12-25 years old let my bad addictions have control over my brain and my life. But also my story of recovery after the age of 25, this might be a long post so take your time, save it if you want to read it later. I hope i can inspire some of you :)\n\nOkay here we go.\n\nGoing all the way back so early childhood age 5-9 as i remember myself, I was a very extroverted kid, I would talk to anyone anywhere anytime my parents had jag hard time shutting me up, i would talk to litterary anyone in the grocery store, at the gas station, at The beach etc etc  I loved birthday parties with friends and was in general very outgoing.\nFast forward to 11-13 years and thats when i discovered my first bad addiction as it were to be as years moved on, this was pornography and excessive masturbation. Then about a year later my cousin showed me a game called runescape. A role playing game where you created a character and started exploring with it in this virtual world.\n\nThis game became huge for me, it was rapidly becoming an addiction and I was hooked.\n\nAs of my early to mid teens i was no longer outgoing talkative and extroverted, but instead one of the most shy, introverted (not mentioning introversion as something negative in general here) and socially anxious kid in school. Because of two things, one my focus was on video games and that was the only thing i cared about and was my way to avoid tough days as a teenager, second was pornography, an addiction I had to make sure to hide very well and what also caused me a lot of shame and anxiety, I always felt disgusted after watching a p video or a magazine, like \"ugh this is weird\".\n\nAges 13-16 which is high school in my country my addictions continued and I also got heavy into procrastinating and seemed to always be doing schoolwork as late as possible and did it just because I had to get this or that grade. I would wake up in the morning, go to school, survive the day among my \"annoying and utterly distasteful classmates and teachers\" then go home play video games until my parents got home, help them with chores, go to Track and field training, go back home and play more video games, and often cram in a session of masturbation and porn. \n\nHowever i wasnt just this big mess at the time because my big light and actual good addiction in life was athletics, track and field. I loved running, long jump and triple jump, i trained 3-4 times a week competed in 15-25 competitions a year and made friends both in my club and from places around my country. This was a sport where i was my best self, i wasnt anxious I wasnt overly shy and introverted even tho I still was a little bit. \nTrack and field was short and sweet my saviour from becoming a braindead zombie only caring about video games and porn. \n\nAt age 16-20 things got better, I graduated high school and started gymnasium or kinda like (pre university school here), this was the first time i started getting friends and became part of the class i was in and not an outsider just trying to survive. I made friends started caring more about school and just naturally decreased my consumption of video games and pornography,even tho video games was still a daily occurance. \n\nMy problem at this point became that i despite my decreased video game habit i still thought about gaming a lot and was often skipping homework if it took too long and instead played video games. \n\nI used to think that i would study to 8pm at night and then i was allowed to play video games, problem was that while studying only half my focus would be on the actual schoolwork and the other half would be on my goals in the video game. I started to stress the homework as fast as possible so i could play games. Which led to lesser understanding of the homework, procrasrinating on it and skipping harder problems because they took too much time, time that was better used playing video games I thought. \n\nLuckily enough I got my shit together around 17 years of age stopped video games completely and got better in school, finished pre university school with pretty good grades good friends and happy. Then went on to work part time in a grocery store for about a year before i went of to my next adventure: University. \n\nAges 20-25, The weirdest years of my life so far. \n\nSo at 20 i packed my bags, flew 900 miles from home to attend a 5 year program in mechanical engineering. Realised I was living alone for the first time and had to take responsibility for myself. Had a smaller panic attack about it and then moved on to university life. Discovered that it was hard as shit, realised that i had a severe problem with social anxiety and just felt like utter shit. Despite this i made friends did my best in classes and participated in what social activities i could. \n\nVideo games were at this point something i had quit atleast i thought so. Until i turned 21- 22 things were pretty decent, i struggled but got through. And then i hit The Wall. \n\nI hit the Wall Hard. I remember waking up one day and just feeling nothing, absolute nothing. I went to class and felt this huge anxiety attack build up as I went in, I went out again, to the toilet where i sat and let it pass, then i took my stuff and went outside for a walk to calm myself. \n\nAs time moved on i slowly felt like I started to move into some kind of bubble, I felt like I was somewhere very far inside my own head, my body was out in real life but my head was so so far away like another dimension. \nI started skipping classes, isolating myself more, stopped seeing friends and it resulted in me being a complete social isolated person for 15 months. \n\nDuring this period, which i look back to now and see as the worst and darkest part of my life. I played video games for 12-15 hours a day, I lived on saved up money and skipped every class, I became a ghost. I went out for walks in the middle of the night when noone i knew could see me, i did my grocery shopping at 6 am on Sunday mornings because i knew noone was out at that time. The rest of the time I was in my apartment, in my own world my own bubble away from everything and everyone, playing video games watching porn and thinking about suicide way too much. \n\nAt the age of 23 i dropped out of university and moved back to my parents, got a full time job as a janitor and started to feel a bit better. I still felt shitty because of \"wasting money and time of my life before\" I started getting into self improvement, tried to stop video games and porn, failed but tried again but was far better than i was before in terms of trying to quit. \n\nOnly problem here was that i was a loner, I had no friends left in my hometowm, i still struggled with anxiety and depression and still had a hard time to get back into reality. \n\nThen at the age of 25 I made a decsion to do whatever it takes and commit myself to heal myself, become better and stop letting my life be controlled by short term pleasures and irrational thoughts and bad emotions. I wanted to become a captain of my own life. \n\nAge 25-30 The years of extreme personal growth. \n\nThis is where the backstory of this post ends and the part of improvement begins. \n\nI turned 30 years old last week and for the last 5 years I have not played video games, watched porn or let any short term bad habit take control of my life. \n\nI got back into university at 25 and attended a 3 year program in sustainable energy engineering. \n\nI got help by a professional for my anxiety issues. \n\nGot my first girlfriend, lost my virginity and had my first kiss at the age of 26. \n\nStarted lifting weights and running long distance. \n\nGraduated university at age 28 with good grades, a girlfriend which im now engaged to and have traveled across half the world with. Also gained many new and amazing friends. \n\nAlmost completely got rid of my social anxiety with help of my professional therapist. \n\nNow I work a full time job and an engineer and I love my job. \n\nThere were some simple key habits that kickstarted my journey that my therapist had talked to me about. \n\n1. Eat well and drink well - eating good and healthy food and only drinking water, alcohol in small amounts sometimes is okay. \n\n2. Get enough sleep - 7-8 hours of quality sleep each night. \n\n3. Excerzise - this is a big one, getting your heart rate up for 30 minutes 3-4 times a week during some form of physical activity is very helpful and will make you feel amazing. \n\nThese 3 habits has since then been my foundation for a good life and then I also added :\n\nDaily meditation for peace of mind and mental clarity. \n\nNo procrastination on things i need to do, quitting gaming and porn cold turkey. \n\nMoving forward in life every Day, even if its just a small step, its still a step. \n\nLearning to appreciate life more just because we only have one. \n\nAnd so many other little things that add something positive to my life. \n\n\nI am 30 years old now, Ive had my bad years i learned from them and kept them as a reminder and a reason to do whatever i can to not get stuck in that same place again. 30 years old is still young, even tho i sometimes regret the years i feel like I wasted to nothing in my teens and 20s I still feel like I have many years left to crush. \n\nA tip: when trying to quit a bad habit life the first 3 months will and can be very hard, you will have to against your mind, you will have moments of feeling hopeless, bored out of this world. But you have to keep going, your mind Will do whatever it can to get you back to comfortable and bad habits. \n\nYou got to show the mind who is boss, you have to start doing whats Hard many times uncomfortable because thats what adds growth, stop giving in to your emotions all the time and start living because when you actually make a true effort to improve your life, you will. \n\n\n\nI know this was a long post, its moslty just telling my story, i hope you can understand it all and take inspiration from it. Also sorry if things are not correctly spelled etc, english is not a first language. \n\nHave a great day and weekend all :)",

I played games like Call of Duty Black Ops 4 where I was really good at. I could get Nuclears and 100+ gameplays.\n\nNow that I've quit gaming I feel good and bad at the same time. Because I've built up all the skills to be able to drop those gameplays I feel bad losing those skills now. Because of all the time I spent improving I feel extra sad about it.\n\nI want to get new hobbies. I don't have many friends (barely any irl friends) and I never get to come in contact with them. \n\nI am trying to make the better version of me. Gaming was just an addiction and an obsession. When I close my eyes in bed I would still see gameplay burned into my eyes. It makes me sick.\n\nMy journey to a better me has succesfully started. If anyone is unsure about if you should quit cold turkey. Just try it. Don't let anybody change your mind and keep your mind on the goals you want to achieve, (being more social, working on your body, starting new hobbies, etc.) \n\nWould you guys mind sharing some experiences and maybe some tips to keep up the first week. \n\nI believe in every single on of you guys that are trying to quit bad habits! You got this.\n\n- Roy",

            "selftext": "Stopping one of my bad habits is easy but stopping all 3 has been impossible so far. I can stop gaming no problem, but then I end up spending more money on eating out, like boba or fries, because I end up going on nightly walks and see them on the way. Or, I end up jacking off way more than usual. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen, I realize that I am wasting too much money and this becomes justification for playing again so that I don't spend money. Or jacking off too much will make me tired all the time, so I try to quit it, but then one of the other 2 habits starts to become more prevalent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow do I stop all 3? It's mostly cravings. Once I think of something or see something that causes a craving, there is almost no resisting it. The pull is SO strong. The only way I can resist it is if I lay on my bed and be a starfish, not moving or doing anything. The simple process of resisting takes so much energy that I end up not being able to do anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny and all tips appreciated, thanks!",

I tried to not to play on computer a lot of times, but it's hard. I think I'm addicted. I didn't have a lot of friends, all I did was just gaming. I tried to sell all my stuff and buy a MacBook Air.

I know, MacBook was unpowerfull for that price, but it gave me something unexplored, something great, premium, but on the other hand, when I was on Windows and I played a lot of games, just total trash.

I went a day without my phone, leaving it off and in my room, and i felt great about it, but that really isnt a viable solution because its blocking potentially important communication. What are some methods of keeping myself off of my phone that some of you have tried?",

The game glues in you like a bubble gum.\n\nThe reason is that they do not let you delete your account immediately. It takes two months for total deletion.

Am just now getting my life together after an amazing life so far but a little too unhealthy. I'm from London but have lived in FL for 6 years now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGaming has always been part of my life but I feel like at times especially when younger the time I spent with it wasnt the healthiest choice, I'm talking mmos etc\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI dont game nearly as much now, have a very good job, play football twice a week, workout three times a week and am trying to join new clubs to meet people and learn javascript and python this year to meet certain goals I have this year. On top of that I'm dating on and off still looking for the potential wife to be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently picked up fifa 19 last week and have been playing it in my down time and have put off a couple 2 hour sessions for learning javascript I have each day cause I felt sick and wanted to relax and game instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started wondering if I do have a problem with gaming whilst doing this and if it's ok to game every now and then etc? (Ive clearly had a problem with addiction in the past)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently whenever I've started playing I've felt guilty because I feel like I'm doing it to fill a void and to help with boredom and that I'm wasting time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess my questions are; does it sound like I'm addicted to gaming from what I've explained? (I get frustrated with fifa but so does everybody)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs it ok to game every day and if so, what's a good amount of time to alot for it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould it be better to quit gaming all together? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs it normal for me to feel like I'm wasting time while playing? I've looked up fomo and I could have some of that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI enjoy gaming but I'm worried I may not be able to fit it into my life healthily if that makes sense and wanted to get your opinions.",

And since that day, gaming has been a huge part of my life, although i once 'quit' and sold all my consoles when i was around 16, however i picked up a ps4 again at age 19 and got right back in to it.\n\nIm not achieving what i want in my career (i want to be a music artist) and feel like gaming is partly responsible. Although i dont game as heavily as i used to, i find myself actually way more invested in the 'Hype machine' of gaming than ever. Scouring the web for bits of information on upcoming games like Death stranding or the last of us part 2, listening to gaming podcasts etc and i think its possibly at an unhealthy level.\n\nI love gaming and really want to play these games that will come out in the next year or so, but I dont think it will benefit me long term and feel guilty like i should be putting that effort in to my music, and i could sell my gaming gear and use that money towards things i need. I am super conflicted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo you guys have any advice for me?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthanks",

I told myself that I wouldn't play any video games until I got my CCNA (networking certificate). As of today, I have it (yay!!). Throughout the past six months I've never really stopped thinking about gaming. I still want to as much as before I quit. My normal routine was between 2 and 3 hours on most weekdays and then weekends could be all day or could be none at all depending on other activities. Do you think it would be a mistake to start again? I am 30, have a good career path, healthy (alternating cardio and strength training 6 days a week) and don't have any real desires that I'm not acting on. I just replaced my gaming time with study time and now I feel like switching back since the studying is over. Bad idea or no?",

            "selftext": "I was supposed to pick up a sweet deal on a keyboard to start learning piano this weekend via the Offer-Up app. But as with most things that seem too good to be true, they turn out to be. I guess the deal fell through as he stopped responding on the day I was supposed to pick it up. So to keep myself busy this weekend I did the following:\n spent Friday hanging out with the family since my parents came to town to get the family together for an Easter dinner. Then did chores until it was bedtime. Falling asleep is easier since I quit weed a couple months ago, but I still have rather odd and intense dreams that wake me up quite often. \n\nOn Saturday I had a barbecue with friends and family and filled the remainder of the day with doing chores and yardwork to the point of exaustion. (I just moved into my own place so there is plenty to fix up in and around the house.) If I still had my video games downloaded I would have not done any yardwork and only been at the barbecue to eat and then return to video games.\n\nSunday was the hardest as I didn't have much to do and all my friends were with their families and what not for Easter. I figured what the hell, lets start another project. I used the extra rocks and dirt from the previous owner of the house to construct a new lounge area in my backyard, completely with hammoks and everything. It took almost 8 hours of constant digging and I can say that I am currently completely exhausted. \n\nBut the sense of accomplishment was really something I haven't felt since crushing some try hards at rainbow six siege. This was even better though. The satisfaction is so much more long lasting than video games and I would have never had the motivation to do this this weekend had I not deleted all my games and forced myself.  I'm not completely done as I plan to add more rocks and a spot for chairs and a table to complete the lounge area. It's actually something I look forward to completing. \n\nSo that's my story of how I made it though the first weekend without video games.I increased my social interactions with friends and family, and took on a project that got my mind off gaming. I'm still looking for sweet deals on a keyboard but looking back I'm glad the deal fell through as it led to something unexpected and meaningful.",

Sometimes i watch movies and i really like it but i know turning from game addict to tv addict is not better. I used to masturbate a lot too but now i mostly stop, only 1-2 times a week maybe (im premature cummer, its not very fun). Im not really addicted to any game in specific, i just love gaming... I still have a lot of free time and i have good grades but Im starting to be less social and people like me less now. I was not like this 3 years ago (i used to be the guy who never shut up and was annoying and now Im the one who talk the least) Weight is a bit bad too. Im 178cm and 80kg but i went on diet and already lost 3kg. I dont know why am i like this, i have friends since we are 4 year olds who play the same as me but they are happy. and i am not. And i have too much time. I used to play tennis but the teacher went to Germany and there isnt any other good sport on my small city ( i tried judo, dont like, football dont like too, and guitar i never liked music). I only once had a girlfriend for 2 years but she would always say she  dont want to be with me and one day i Said sorry its enough. Now i havent  really cared for girls since that. Im grateful for friends, health, family etc but i wish some things changed. Sorry for going a lot off topic but it feels good to finally write everything ... thank you",

I can\u2019t say that I overdo my gaming hours like some who really used to game for hours upon hours, still though, I\u2019ve often wondered myself if I should give it up.\n\nSo quite a few know me here as a single player gaming advocate who believes that the problem is mainly multiplayer games. I do wonder though and I\u2019ve been reading here as well as the Olganon forum and it\u2019s pretty much the same usual suspects that come up in conversations when people say that gaming has ruined their life... these games seem to be LOL, DOTA 2, WOW, Overwatch, Starcraft etc. over and over I see these games named as the prime reason people let things spiral out of control. I haven\u2019t seen much complaints about single player games, I realize Skyrim, Witcher 3 or other Epgs can offer tons of hours of gameplay and I usually try to steer clear of these commitment heavy games. So why do people still think it\u2019s all gaming that is the problem? I\u2019m really just looking for some healthy input which I can weigh myself in my own case.",

            "selftext": "Sorry if the grammar is off and all, I have no excuse you're just gonna have to deal with it.\nTLDR: I let myself be bored for a while and it was really hard (really hard). After 6 months, I tried playing video games again and it was boring AF. \n\nWhen I quit video games completely about 6 months ago I got bored. I would spend most of the first few days laying in bed listening to music or just sleeping. However, I didn't just quit video games, I quit watching movies, shows, youtube and reddit. My rule was I can only catch up on news after 8pm for a max of 1 hour. \nBoredom was the hardest part of the process and the biggest reason why I kept relapsing in the past. This time I decided that I would rather be bored out my mind than spend another day wasting my time on the internet. I thought maybe if I just let my self be bored and do a lot of thinking without distractions I would eventually think of something to do. \nSure enough a month later I had written down 100's of cool ideas I had, made plans and started executing some of them. 6 months later, I am working on 2 apps (well we kind of just use the app idea as an excuse to hang out and do stuff) with people I met and now are my friends. I got accepted to a university for a comp. science degree starting next fall, got financial aid to cover all of it, decided to get mental help (anxiety maybe adhd as well), went on 2 double dates, started working out a week ago and yada yada yada. \n\nBUUUUT... it wasn't easy. I spent days upon days just sitting around in my room wanting to kill (not literally, I am not depressed) myself because of boredom. I drove around my city for several hours a week drinking redbull after redbull, going to cafes trying different coffees, I regrettably step into a vape shop that smell like puke and vape juice. I hung out with my cousins and some friends from school whenever they were available. It didn't help that they wanted to play video games...(hence why i tried making some new ones) I forced one of my friends to go rock-climbing with me which wasn't fun because he clearly didn't want to be there. I had many cringy and awkward social situations which led to more anxiety, I spent some money on things that I probably should not have. In the moment, I felt like shit, the itch for me to open my phone and just turn off my brain was so strong that I had to start jumping around or punching something to prevent myself from going on youtube or playing a game of league. I am not going to lie, i did relapse a few times, but when I caught myself I would turn everything off and go drive around so I wouldn't be able to touch my phone.\n\nNow I look back and I don't regret a second of it. I know it sounds cliche, but its true. I feel like i am living for the first time, I feel like i am in a movie, my story is a script written by creative hippie.... its amazing. Its not the kind of amazing you think though, its kind of hard to describe. Its amazing in a way of like going through tough level in a video game but its fun, but still very very hard and it pisses you of a lot, gives you anxiety and nightmares. Why do that in a game if you can do that in real life?\n\nIts funny, because a few days ago I tried to play a game of league and some Minecraft, but I was bored out of my mind and wanted to kill my self (again not literally).\n\nI don't really know what the lesson here is, I guess just let the boredom happen? Expect it, accept it and know its okay to be bored. Sure boredom isn't fun, it hurts, outcomes may vary, instead you could be having fun playing video games. However your life story will probably end up being boring.",

As of right now, I am thinking of implementing games back in my life, I understand that this subreddit is for people experience after they stop playing games but I still think that this still might be appropriate for this subreddit. Instead of just playing games however long I like, I am thinking about implementing a schedule, this schedule will include my game time and my work time. As of now, I come back from school at aprox 3:30  and thought about allowing myself to play until 6:00 - 7:00 which will give me the whole night to work. This will vary for the weekends as it totally depends on how much work I have to finish. This is what I have for now, please feel free to comment on how I should improve my schedule, opinions on the topic, or any advice.",

The game lost its appeal to me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlthough I still have huge problems related to my computer. I still spend way too much time infront of the screen. I started weightlifting some time ago and it's one of the few things I look forward to in my life. I also went from 1 or 2 close friends to knowing hundreds of people since I found StopGaming. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I still feel like missing something huge. There is still this huge void every single day that I fill with mindless crap such as YouTube, Reddit and Twitch if I am not out meeting with friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt definitely hurts my life as it ruins my sleeping schedule. I tried everything from going out alone, to learning a new language, reading all the famous self-improvement books. Nothing appeals to me. I used to play chess on a decently high level, but also quit after 16 years of playing because it took over all my time. \n\nLike I said, I am an all or nothing type of guy. And since ever I quit League there has been this MASSIVE void of missed competitive environment that kills me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI realized that going away from the computer is actually easy if you have something to replace it with. But that's the hard part. I want to stop wasting time so badly, but seem to have no alternative.",

            "selftext": "I have been playing Lords mobile since November 2017 and I was hooked from the minute I downloaded it. The graphics, the people, the gameplay et cetera. \n\nI vowed to not spend money on the game but just a month in and that vow went out the window, it started slow but quickly accelerated and I was soon spending hundreds of euros every month. And just like the money - my withdrawal from society started slowly as well. I have always been a great student, barely ever had to study for tests and loved going there but as I became more and more invested into the game my love for learning and going to school decreased exponentially... Calling in sick from school, not showing up to tests, lying to my mother and teachers, basically just digging my hole deeper and deeper.\n\nThis was during my final year of high school and completely failed my first semester, yet I didn't care - all that was on my mind was Lords Mobile. I stopped talking to my friends and continued to ignore those who attempted to help me. \n\nI was sent to a psychiatrist but even though I appreciated her help, I did nothing but ignore her and lie about everything. \n\nBy the end of my senior year I had barely been at school once and, obviously, I didn't have enough points to graduate. I watched my friends enjoy the happiest day of their lives on Facebook from my dark bedroom. It barely moved me though, I had just unlocked the highest grade troops and forged some of the best gear in the game. \n\nThings just got worse and worse, the few friends I had left stopped caring and the only people I was talking with was the people I met in Lords mobile. My family and psychiatrist also realised how futile their efforts were and, just like my friends, stopped caring as well. By this time I had also spent ~4000 euros on the game (money I do not have).\n\nAfter a summer where I spent most of my time in my room, I decided I wanted to change. I was in contact with my school and they were willing to give me a second chance. I was still playing the game but I managed to pull myself away to study and go to class. But I was still playing the game and the first and last thing I did every day was to check the game. \n\nI started feeling better and I believed I had finally managed to find a good balance between the game and my real life. But in retrospect I definitely  hadn't. Sure I was able to put down my phone/tablet for a couple hours a day but the game made me feel awful. If things were good in the game, things were good in real life and if things were bad in the game, they were bad in real life. The game affected my state of mind constantly. I was an \"R4\" (basically an admin) of a very big guild and there was constantly things that had to be taken care of. On top of that, I was constantly fighting in the game and doing other things which took up a substantial amount of time.\n\nBut about a month ago I decided one night to just stop. I was so fed up with life and I contemplated committing suicide over some now small, insignificant thing in the game but amidst all these thoughts I just decided to delete the game, line, discord, WG. Everything that linked me in some way to that game, I deleted and I decided to postpone my suicide, at least until tomorrow. Never said goodbye to anyone. I have been trying to quit before but I had always talked with my friends and they always managed to convince me to stay. Always making me feel guilty over leaving (you are so lovely and nice, you are so strong, you are a special part of our guild et cetera ad infinitum). I wasn't going to let any person, especially no one I had never even talked to in person, influence my decision.\n\nThe day after, I woke up with a strange feeling, like a weight had been lifted from my chest. A week later I started reading Marcus Aurelius, contacted several stores and sent in my resume, managed to get hired as a store clerk and I now work several times a week and have met so many great people because of this. I have started talking to people again and for the first time in years, I no longer feel afraid to go outside my house.\n\nI will graduate this June and I will probably be going to university this fall to study law.\n\nPlease forgive me for the spelling errors and grammar, it's very late here and I have been drinking. Just felt the need to get all this off my chest. Screw Lords mobile and other mobile games. Almost two years of my life is gone along with ~7000 euros. I hate myself for this but I promised myself that I would repay my mom for everything she had to suffer through, I hope I will one day make her proud.",

            "selftext": "I swear this is not an insult to anyone...\n\nI\u2019m going to be honest here. Not too long ago when I first saw this subreddit, my initial reaction was laughing. I did not understand why there is a subreddit dedicated to \u2018gaming addiction\u2019 and I was reading people\u2019s posts and comments and they may have made me laugh. But then I did realize that as fun as gaming is, if it is getting in the way of work or social life, then maybe you should tone it down or stop. Anyways, if anyone took offence to the beginning of this post, then my apologies. I don\u2019t mean to, well, be mean. I understand gaming addiction exists, hell I have it. I found this reddit because I searched up why I\u2019m having troubles enjoying games when I know that I like them. I play video games a lot and it definitely stops me from doing work or having any social life. I stay awake until 5 am playing games even though I know I have to wake up in 2-3 hours. There\u2019s so many times where I have passed out while playing. I spend most of my free time playing games, in fact I spend upwards to 12 hours in a day. Luckily, it doesn\u2019t stop me from eating or going to the bathroom, but I definitely spend way too much time playing video games even though I don\u2019t even think I enjoy them anymore. I don\u2019t know the point of this post, since I started it by insulting people who are truly going through something. And I spent the last part of it explaining how I have a gaming addiction, which might be useful if I wanted help. I love video games. I think I play them because of how much I used to love them and because it seems like the only thing in my life that I can be happy with. I\u2019ll never truly admit to myself that I don\u2019t even like playing them anymore, because if I do, then I\u2019ll have to accept the reality of life. Some people may think I\u2019m lying here but I\u2019m honestly not. I hate video games but I love them, at least I want to, and that\u2019s the reason why I\u2019ll continue to ruin my life by playing them when I should be sleeping or doing work. In conclusion, my gaming habits are literally destroying and repairing my life. Kinda funny.",

I am studying computer science and feel like im really interested into that.\n\nHowever I\u2018ve been playing oldschool runescape on a daily basis for aprox more than 8 hours a day, even when im not online I\u2018m thinking about the next goals or next things to do online. It even goes that far that I\u2018m skipping lectures to stay at home and continue playing.\n\nI actually have a big interest in programming yet i still never do it / learn it, i basically spend all my time playing osrs. \nI know i have to quit, but i just can\u2018t. And i do not want to give up gaming for good. \nIs it advisable to play anything else instead of oldschool runescape? it\u2018s just such a massive time sink. \n\nHow do i prioritize programming and/or studying in general? And is it possible to find a nice balance between gaming and studying? \n\nMy grades are getting worse and worse and i don\u2018t know how to climb out of this pit.",

            "selftext": "Backstory:\nLast year I made one of the best decisions of my life and that was quitting runescape. \nI purposely got my account ban by \u201cBotting\u201d for a week straight 12 hours a day to hopefully free my addiction from this game. It worked. Account perma banned. Deleted the game client, deleted everything osrs related and from that point on, it was time to clean up my life.\n\nLost weight and started going back to the gym.  Started to rekindle the fire I once had with my girlfriend. Picked up a new hobby which was playing piano. Set a goal for reading a book every month.  Life was going great, I\u2019ve never felt more ambitious.\n\nNow: \nAfter being cleaned for 10 months straight, my friend who\u2019s into osrs invited me to come hangout with him and a couple pals for his bday. And to surprise him, I thought why don\u2019t I start a new account and start playing again for his birthday? (just casually, nothing like it was before) He was super happy about it but as you can see things did not go as planned. \n\nI hopped back on the virtual grind train immediately, I was neglecting my college friends and girlfriend. Opting to skip out on social events to play osrs instead. Lost interest in my hobbies, my piano and books were collecting dust. Stopped going to the gym. A month back playing, I recognized that this GAME has completely HIJACKED MY REWARD SYSTEM IN MY BRAIN. There was a reason why I quit this game in the first place. \n\nAs long as I made progression in a pixelated game, my brain was content . Now that this game is on mobile too, being 1 second away from continuing the grind has made it so much more harder to put the damn game down. This game substitutes your real life goals for some fake achievements that mean absolutely nothing. I thought I could continue to work on my daily life goals whilst playing this game in moderation. Yeah no. For a game to easily reward you by just clicking on pointless objects, quickly takes control of your brain. \n\nToday, I dropped everything I worked for on my account to discourage me from playing. So far it\u2019s working but the itch to play has never been more severe but after awhile I know it will be worth it because I\u2019ve done it before.  Wanted to share my on going story of battling with gaming. \n\nGuys it\u2019s not too late to stop, don\u2019t let your addiction ruin your life any more. Don\u2019t wait to quit till you get that certain \u201clevel\u201d or \u201cachievement\u201d.  The biggest achievement and success is dropping the game now, it won\u2019t feel like it at first but I promise it will be in the long run. Good luck",

            "selftext": "I've been playing video games for quite some time now, at least 10 years. Video games have always been a huge part of my life. I would follow the news on upcoming releases, talk about games with friends and so on. Video games never really affected me in a negative way. I'm close and in touch with my friends and family, it never affected sleep, mental health or anything of that sort. It was just something I did in during my downtime. I used to play video games for about 2-3 hours a day, but recently I've only been playing about 3 hours a week. Mostly because I've been busy with other things in my life, like sports, books, tv, friends, schoolwork and other hobbies and also I haven't really been enjoying video games as much as I used to. But for those 3 or so hours a week recently, I've noticed that with those 3 hours I could probably do something useful, like learn a new language or pick up a new instrument etc. Also I've noticed that when I play video games I usually am in a worse mood after I finish my session than when I started. So eventually I was like \"why don't I quit gaming altogether?\" and so I tried. But it hasn't been easy. Any free time I have I am immediately drawn towards gaming just because that's what I'm used to. For so many years whenever I had any down time I would turn to video games almost immediately. I feel like I'm holding on to something that's not there, like I'm chasing a high that I'll never get again. I feel my brain is remembering all of these nostalgic fun times I used to have gaming and associates it with gaming so it games. Even if it never gets that nostalgia again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for the lengthy post it's just idk what to do anymore, I want to quit but I almost feel like quitting gaming would be saying goodbye to a piece of me which doesn't feel right.",

            "selftext": "Help. Please. Anyone who has been in this situation. Im at breaking point and unless I gain some comprehension as to where the fuck my husband's head is at,  there is no place left for me in this marriage. \n\nHis phone game. Its the 3rd wheel in our marriage. The mistress he stays up late with, has secret rendezvous dates with in the garage and cant put down, even on Christmas day. He appears more committed to the 40 strangers in his alliance, making them promises to hit targets and fulfilling his duties to those pixels, every weekend. Meanwhile the promises he made in regards to his marriage?...take less priority. There are 40 people in an alliance. I come 41st. \n\nLast weekend I discovered he'd been using an old credit card I dont see the transaction of, to purchase in game credits. The monetary amount (although ridiculous) is not my concern. Its the lies and the deception. 2yrs worth.\n\nI confronted him. He sat in the yard and I thought he was going to cry when he said \"I think Ive already lost you\" \nI assumed he'd realised that getting caught out lying to your wife for years was enough to shake him up enough for him to not want to go near anything that would cause him to behave in such a way, to become a liar and hide shit from me.\n\nI assumed he was so grateful that I didnt walk out there and then, that he uninstalled the game. I didn't ask him to do that, I thought the prospect of the marriage ending would have been sufficient for him to do it himself. \n\nI comfort him. Hug him.  Tell him we will work thru it. He needs to help me learn to trust him again. I dont go off the rails about it or mention it again (I am still under the assumption at this point that hes uninstalled it)\n\nFast forward 3 days later and Im on the phone to overseas sorting out a major situation with our mortgage. Im in tears, Ive  been on the phone for 3hrs already  trying not to lose our house. Whilst Im on hold with the mortgage people,  he gets up and goes to the garage for a smoke. Hes in there playing his fucking phone game, while I am having a fucking heart attack trying not to lose the house. I have never felt so alone in all my life. To be left crying at a kitchen table, with my life crumbling all around me, he walks out and starts playing a game I thought he uninstalled 3 days ago because of the lies. \n\nI literally cant deal with him and his phone game at this point and just battle on with sorting the mortgage issue at hand. I dont bring it up again, Im exhausted after dealing with the bank and I just cant deal.\n\n3 days later and here we are....Easter public holiday weekend. He still hasnt uninstalled the game and has told his alliance commander he will try his best to hit the minimum target this weekend.  ITS FUCKING EASTER. \n\nWhat do I do? Uninstall it myself and try to save whats left of our marriage? Or accept the fact the prospect of losing his robots upsets him more than losing his wife, or he'd have got rid and uninstalled already?\n\nSomebody please give me 1 god damn reason why I shouldn't just walk out the door right now. Does this ever get any better? Do people really throw away their marriages, lives, homes and futures, over pixelated images on a phone? What the actual fuck? \n\n(Sorry for the rant, clearly the prospect of my marriage ending has me quite emotional)",

            "selftext": "Hey Everyone, I wanted to share with you a story how I quitted playing online games with pretty unconventional way. I'm gonna start from saying that I'm not some kind of specialist with gaming addiction but I was fighting with it for a pretty long time now. So let's get into it:  \nIn this situation, I quitted playing Apex legends which is pretty popular \"battle royale\" type game now. I guess that this type of games is one of the most addicting because of the aspect of competitiveness. So I was trying to quit it for about 1.5 months and finally, I'm over it. I have to say that I tried quitting cold turkey as well as portioning and minimalizing time that I play in a longer period of time. Any time, anyway I failed so I decided to do something different. This way is actually pretty similar to quitting cold turkey but it's way easier and more fun. So what I did was that I downloaded an OFFLINE game that I could really get into. In my case it was Sekiro: The shadows die twice. I really got into the game and after playing it I simply preferred to play the Offline game with the actual, good story that online game. Now I must say that the Offline game got me really addicted, even more than the online BUT Offline games are the games with a story. You can simply get to the end of the story and there's no point in playing more. I ended the game in about a week and I can say, that I don't feel any need to play the online battle royale game anymore. I think that this is actually a pretty good way and more effective way than a simple cold turkey because we are focusing on something even more addicting, but then it simply ends. For me playing one offline game was enough but for each person, it works different. I'm not saying that it will work for everyone, but cold turkey doesn't work for everyone either. Thank you and I hope that it can help someone.",

I've waited for it for so long and want to play it so bad :(\n\nI'm worried that I'll quit for months then think to myself \"it couldn't hurt to check it out\"  and end up losing 1500 hours again ... how do you deal with something like that popping back up?  It's one thing to ditch games I've already got hundreds of hours in, but I know this is going to be like dangling heroin in front of me :(",

As part of a final project in one of our classes, we're doing a small study on a mobile app called Forest to see if it can help folks mitigate their bad procrastination-related habits and be more productive in general. We're having some issues with in-person recruitment, so now we're turning to online communities for help!\n\nThe study involves: 1) First, taking a short (15-20 minute) survey 2) Second, using the app as much or as little as you please over the course of about a week (It costs $2, but we would gift it to you.) 3) Finally, taking a longer survey (45-60 minutes) after that period is up\n\nWe're looking for active students (full and part-time, undergrad or graduate) in any country who are at least 18 years old. If this sounds like something you'd be interested in, send me a DM!\n\nThank you so much! :)",

No game but played a tabletop game requiring quite a lot of brain focus from 6 pm to 1 am  \nSun 14/04 : 24% of deep sleep.

Watched GoT with friends and drank some beer  \nTue 16/04 : 67% of deep sleep. Didn't game, didn't drink  \n\n\nI can't say for sure but the highest percentages seem to be always coming when i don't game. The lowest come when i either game or drink beer shortly before sleeping.",

Doing this research project has been quite an eye-opener for me, and helped me be more aware of my own unhealthy gaming habits. \n\nIt seems the battle against addictive behaviour always comes down to the individual affected, but the gaming industry also has a responsibility to gamers. Addiction is good for business (if not great for PR), and the ways in which game companies inscribe their products with qualities that make them more addictive needs to come under scrutiny... That's the aim of this research project, at any rate. \n\nIf you're reading this and have 5-10 minutes to spare, please help by filling in the short questionnaire (link above). Thank you :)",

But believe me, now i subconsciously hate the game.And I haven't uninstalled it just to keep myself strong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wanted to become an electronic music producer when i joined the college. I got aware of my addiction because one year later I realized that I didn't learned/produced enough music. The learning curve was bit boring for me so the same happened next year. Whenever I opened my DAW (music making software), and couldn't make good music(sounded like trash), instead of learning/making it better I got frustrated and double-clicked my DOTA 2 Icon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis new year I decided I would dedicate my time to music more. I stopped playing ranked matches, played normal matches only. This helped me to be less serious/competitive about the game(Just imagine a game without adrenaline rush). I stopped trying hard in games as the wins didn't matter to me anymore(just enjoyed kicking some asses). Eventually the craving to play also faded.",

My professor wants us to add an interview to our paper. As I was researching for this assignment I saw on a website about this subReddit. So here I am, looking for anyone who might be interested in answering a few of my questions about your story. If there are a lot of you I may end up only asking a few people to participate. If there are any questions you have for me please leave a comment I will do my best with answering any questions you guys may have. As for me if you are fully interested in helping me out with my paper I am creating please DM me so we can set up a time to conduct this interview. The interview should take no longer than 30 minutes. Thank you for your time to read this. I do respect everything everyone is doing here I believe that this is a good thing and it is not easy. I've been battling with myself on my eating habits, to break something is not easy and for that, you guys are very strong to do what you guys are doing. For that much love for you all. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a public service announcement, I will be recording what you say as this is an interview and I do need to be able to access what you say. Also, I don't mind if you would rather do a text interview or do a voice chat interview either works for me. Last, I know this can be sometimes a sore subject so I will try my best to not push if I ask something too personal or you are not interested in sharing.",

The same goes for when I'm having a cup of tea or coffee, or when I'm waiting for someone or something; I'm distracted enough not to want to get into anything too serious, but not engaged enough to have to focus on what I'm doing. Gaming always kind of fit this area where it is moderately distracting and entertaining, but the obvious problem of course is that it takes too much time and is unproductive and unsatisfying afterwards. \n\nAny of you recognize this feeling and have any tips on how to address it?",

To learn all as much about the game as possible (recipes/builds/strategies)\n\nIt was all a competition against the game and against myself.\n\nA very stressful competition. Gaming was extremely stressful for me but i used to keep doing it.\n\nFeels quite absurd looking back, i tried gaming for the last few weeks but at each time something difficult came up, i actually stopped and thought: wait, why the fck would i use my energy and stress myself to solve that/do this etc?

            "selftext": "I've stopped playing video games completely for about two months now and I had a realization why gaming held me hostage for so long. I remember a point when I hated video games and I resented it. I would play overwatch for hours (or take whole days during breaks) and the entire time, I was extremely unhappy because I knew I could be doing something better, but I still played. I was bored playing video games, but I didn't want to stop because I didn't want to have to deal with actual things I had to do, like music and homework. It was a form of escapism, but I realized I became such a nasty, disgusting human being when I got too competitive in video games.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think the two lowest points in my life were the few days leading up to me getting legend in hearthstone and the few days leading up to me getting diamond in overwatch. I would wake up and go straight to the computer, not even getting some water or brushing my teeth. I completely neglected my health, my room and desk became a pigsty (which made it even harder to get myself to do things), and I became extremely angry whenever someone wanted me to do something that wasn't gaming related. I would throw a fit every time my parents asked me to stop my game and go eat dinner. It was ridiculous. I acted like I was 5. My priorities became skewed and I felt completely out of control. My life was spiraling downhill fast. I was getting angry at things that were completely out of my control (like throwing teammates, missing a toin coss in hearthstone, etc.) and I felt worse every day. I alienated myself from the people I loved and became a person I did not want to be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLuckily I hit legend and diamond, because after I did so, I started to feel more relaxed and get away from the game. If I never hit my goal, I might have continued. But after I hit my goal, I felt so happy I cried. But after about two hours, I felt empty, unfulfilled, but I didn't understand why at the time. I put a lot of hard work and effort I thought, so I didn't understand why I felt almost no satisfaction. Ultimately, I came to understand that NONE OF THIS IS REAL. I became deluded. I mixed up reality with video games and that led to a spiral of self hate and resentment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlthough, I regret my past decisions, there's a lot to learn about this and for anyone that's struggling with this, I send my sympathy. Competitive video games turned me into a beast. For those struggling, I hope you understand you're not alone and recovery is possible. Quitting will be a long, tedious journey, which for some may be a lifelong struggle and that's ok. Try to find something you love. For me, I found a lot of solace in learning about philosophy (Stoicism has helped me a lot), listening to jazz, and playing music. Going on long walks became a great time for me to reflect on my actions and gave me hope for the future. I wish you luck on your journey and I hope you can overcome gaming.",

            "selftext": "I have finally came  to the conclusion that gaming is no longer something I wish to be a part of. I have been gaming for over 10 years now, it is a something which has been a part of my life for a long period of time and defines all aspects of my life. I am embarrassed with the amount of time I have invested into video games. I am frankly angry with myself. I have chosen to gain experience in a fake reality, gaining skill points towards such things as: critical hit chance increase and increased vitality rather than \"real\" skills which are applicable to life. \n\nI am currently in my second year of University studying Business Management. Overall I am doing quite well on my course however, I cant help but escape this feeling that I haven't experienced the full university lifestyle. I have came to the realisation that I have paid 9 thousand pounds a year to play video games (that's how much it costs to study at university in England). I find myself staying up way too late, missing my seminars and lectures and turning down invites to social events as a result of video games. The most frustrating part is I don't really enjoy playing them anymore. I waste hours flicking from one game to the next, seeking something to gain my interest. Spending money on games, I know I will never play. \n\nI just feel as though I am stuck in a rut. As I type this \"rant\" (I don't know what this piece of reading is meant to be by the way) I am laying awake at 2.30 AM in a very messy bedroom, with no desire to do anything. I believe video games have taken my ability to learn self discipline or any sense of responsibility. I find myself doing the bare minimum to continue my university course as well as to keep my relationships with people in tact. \n\nAnyway I am done with gaming. I know I am going to struggle but it is something I need to do. I'm just sick to death of being the same old person. Any helpful comments would be appreciated. Let me know ff anyone else can relate to my situation.\n\nI apologise if this is a difficult read, its just a mix of thoughts and most likely comes across as a tangent rather than a structured piece. Hopefully I was still able to get my point across.",

            "selftext": "I'm currently 22, and for most of my life I've been a gamer. However it's never taken over my life. I've done well in school and college, had plenty of crazy fun with all my friends, have immersed myself in other hobbies like playing piano and frisbee, etc. Gaming was just another hobby, and it kept me hyped up for everything else in life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past four years I've been playing League though, since it was a lot more fun than other games. And it became a default activity for when I was bored at home. If I was at home (and thus not doing any of the above activities), I'd default to playing League to fill time and prevent boredom -- though I had done that with other games in the past.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBack in February the game became stale, and with my myriad of free time this semester I began to self-reflect. And I hit an identity crisis. These last two months have been a wild ride: I uncovered that I was super stressed and anxious about my future since I was about to graduate, I was feeling depressed and empty because I had no hobby or time-killer to replace gaming with if I was truly bored of it, and I had plenty of existential thoughts. I started hitting up old friends, making a list of potential interests and careers for my post-grad life, reading a lot about my feelings, and going to therapy, all of which have made me feel better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter about 45 days of not playing, I fired up League again this evening to see if my mindset would change. I set up a bot game just to play for a few minutes, and my brain was filled with that sweet sweet dopamine. I was back to living in the present like I always have. I immediately exited the game. It's been about two hours and I still feel fine and calm, like my old self.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow my question is: am I addicted to League (even though I'm capable of playing it in moderation)? Or have I just been using gaming to escape from my problems instead of facing them?",

The demons will eventually show up if you don't do anything consciously to resolve the discrepancy yourself.**\n\nOne thing that I'm so grateful for games is the fact that I know there are activities I can do that produce tons of flow, that don't involve drugs or a high-risk die-young lifestyle, or just being a drama queen or troll who unconsciously picks fights with people.\n\nI've tried quitting gaming before.  I found this community around February last year, and I actually nuked my entire steam account last April.\n\nHowever, i eventually came back to gaming because I guess I couldn't fulfill all the needs or scratch all the itches that gaming originally did over the last 5-7 years.  So I think I just snapped one day and binged a couple months on mobile gacha games back in August.  (never had any interest in gacha games at all up to that point)\n\nAfter realizing how empty mobile gacha games were/are, I tried to quit again in October, which lasted about a month, but then I recreated a new brand new steam account in early November to *casually* play over the holidays.  After about 2,000 combined hours on that new steam account, I know now that I need to quit again.\n\nMy favorite [game quitters video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhwZ4JZLhz4).\n\nOn a side note, I lost a lot of weight last year due to quitting gaming and consciously changing my diet.  Luckily the eating habits stuck even while binging on gaming.  Because even though I got absorbed in various gaming binges over the past months, I somehow managed to keep off most of the weight I lost.  I lost about 40 lbs last year (230lbs to 190lbs), but only gained like 5 lbs back over last gaming binge.  (Weigh about 195lbs today)\n\nAnd when I say binge, I usually mean eat/sleep/game with very little else day-in day-out.  (I'm an accountant, in-between jobs, living off of savings until I find my next gig.)\n\nAnyways, just like how nutrient-deficient diets aren't sustainable, i think flow-deficient IRL activities aren't sustainable either.  We've already opened pandora's box with gaming, so trying to live a milder quieter life that doesn't produce as much flow as gaming does is a recipe for relapse.\n\nNot gonna lie, accounting is pretty boring, but not so much that I want to switch careers and become a smoke jumper or something.  I already know that no job will be an endless supply of flow.  And although I think acting like some out-of-control reality tv star would be fake, I also now think that acting like some laid-back mild-mannered accountant is fake too.  There's some middle-ground somewhere in there.\n\nI'm just thinking out loud here.  Everybody is different.  Everyone plays games for different reasons.  And everyone who realizes they need to quit, does so for different reasons too.\n\nBut I think a lot of us who are addicted to gaming probably need more excitement IRL, but at the same time don't want to become those stereotypical IRL douchebags who are memed about online.  I know I sure don't want to be memed like Shia LeBeouf yelling \"Do it!\" over and over again.  (that was kind of unfair to him btw)\n\nSorry for the long rant.  I just felt like typing something out since reset my badge the other day.  Hopeful others here can relate to needing more intensity and flow IRL, but don't want to fall down the rabbit hole either.  Good luck everyone.",

            "selftext": "So a year ago I had quit league of legends and it lasted for 6 months. I would play 4-6 hrs a day, which gave me no value aside from my competitive nature. During my time of detoxication I started becoming more aware of what I wanted to do in life, I started learning more online, hitting the gym and socializing. But after a few months in I became bored and decided to play 'one' game with old friends as a catch up which lead to more.\n\nIt's been roughly 6 months since I have relapsed back to 6-7 hrs of league of legends and I'm writing to this group to try again and hopefully inspire others who have failed to not give up. It's okay to fail just have the power to get back up and try again to achieve whatever success you want to achieve. You have the power to change the course of your life, just get up and do it!",

            "selftext": "*TL;DR - Typical thread you've seen before asking what to do after quitting games. Can't drive and family is unsupportive. Brother fucking hates me for some reason. Scared to death of socializing.* \n\n  \n\n\nFor this first day, instead of actually trying to find something to do besides gaming, I've been sitting in my chair thinking about games. I'd get outside the house and maybe try some things (like martial arts or maybe horseback riding) but I can't drive and my family is pretty unsupportive (we actually did try seeing a counselor but it only really helped a little bit). My brother especially has been making me feel like shit, thinking that I can't be helped (with my anxiety and depression and everything) and it's because \"I'm not trying\". Which I guess he'd be right, I wasn't trying.\n\nI thought that I should try programming and/or art, since those are the two things I'm most passionate for but that'd mean I'd have to be in front of a laptop which I'm trying to limit my screen time. I've also heard some recommendations that I should try to socialize, I actually tried to join a school club but I was so scared to go to a meeting I made a lame excuse that the club didn't actually exist yet. Now, it's gotten bad to the point where I actively try to avoid talking to people at school. My thought process was that if I stopped gaming and maybe even got off the computer I'd socialize a bit more but I feel like I'm off putting an even negative-er vibe.\n\n~~I don't even know if I'm posting in the right sub anymore lol~~But anyways that's my problem. I guess what I'm asking is how do you find something to do with so few options? Or am I just stressing out and complaining over nothing? Sorry if this post is kind of shit I'm pretty tired.",

I stopped for a bit and put my life together enough to graduate but I can feel it progressing and getting worse over time. It's like I'm slowly stripping pieces of myself away and I don't even have the willpower to stop. My friends have all moved on as I've become this empty husk of a person and I've been pretty regularly contemplating suicide. I think I'm going to make another attempt eventually, I just haven't worked up to that point yet",

            "selftext": "Although I still do watch and support my favorite LCS team. I quit playing League of Legends (cold turkey) back in December. It had to be done. I was wasting 2-3 hours of daily time, trying to stay relevant in a game which didn't provide anything of value for me. Zero benefits. Not friendships, or social interaction, or monetary gain... Nothing. It was just an escape for me. Something brainless to do where I wouldn't be me for those 3-4 hours a day. Which wasn't healthy. So after relapsing in early December I just uninstalled, started living out of a Chromebook and took up some new hobbies. Now I paint and sketch, cook excellent meals, and also go to the gym much much more. And yes, in someways, it's tough not to go back. In others... I just find myself feeling more proud of myself. I feel much more mature and strong. For having realized that I needed an escape from myself. Which is fine, so long as it's a healthy escape which promotes my own well-being, etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust wanted to share my experience and encourage others to uninstall and not look back. All of that time compounds, especially when you're a young person. Invest that time in a future you can be proud of, and you'll be a much better person in the long run for doing so. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTake care all!",

My girlfriend (together 3 years) also has a 40hr job, but she has a very good work-life balance at her job. My biggest problem is that the last 2 years, we have bonded greatly with gaming and she loves playing co-op games together. We've played so many co-op story or online games together. These are often a timesink and will eat up 3-9 hours a day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have gotten in trouble at my job for not performing well, but I waste my time after work playing video games instead of keeping up with my peers. My girlfriend gets very sad when I don't play with her. I have gone through phases of deleting all my games, but then I relent and will end up playing with her. Then it culminates again, I fall behind in work (like tonight), and just realized today I spent 11am-3pm playing with her, then 4-9pm. Now she is off to bed and I am up at 2am doing work because I didn't spend the 5 hours needed today to catch up on an especially heavy work week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI HATE VIDEO GAMES. I wish I could remove them from everyone's memories and delete them off the face of the earth. My brother, my dad, and my mom all play video games. My brother is addicted more than me (but living a NEET-ish underemployed life with my patient parents) but I have far more day-to-day obligations than him. I feel so bitter about how my love for my girlfriend is translating into failure at work, failure within my relationship (she is mad at my stress levels regarding work). I feel like a stupid, professional/introvert version of an addict who is trying to quit but keeps relapsing due to a partner/family. Fuck this shitty life I have done to myself.",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone, just found out about this subreddit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBack in freshman year of high school, I used to play games every week. I played starcraft 2 and overwatch, csgo, and tf2. Games were a part of my life. Whenever I had some free time laying around, my immediate go-to was clicking on my fav video game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, in the summer between freshman and sophomore year, I started to realize how much time I had wasted on video games and how they were dragging me down in arguably what would be the most important years of my life. I felt horrible after each session of gaming and I started to realize that I was actually addicted to the games I were playing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter quitting cold turkey and fighting through the initial month or two of \"withdrawal\" my life improved indefinitely. I started to develop hobbies, like close up magic and started exercising more. I dug deeper into programming and published a game on the play store. My grades went up and I could devote hours and hours into preparing for the SAT, with me finally achieving my goal of getting a good score. Quitting gaming allowed me to fully harness my potential and allow me to shape myself into the person I wanted to become. I became\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWithout the controlling influence of games, I started seeking out extracurricular opportunities and found one of my passions in teaching. I can study and focus for hours on end without having the temptation to hop on the computer and start ranking up. I gained more appreciation for my life and the world around me. I don't even want to think what would have happened if I never made the decision to go cold turkey.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I am in an awesome position where my grades are looking great, I got into a super competitive summer camp, and I have a good sense of what I want to do with my life and what interests me now that I don't play video games anymore. Instead of the urges to cheese someone in starcraft, I now look up interesting DIY projects I might want to do in my weekends, like making a chemical rocket, or engineering my own battery with some grapes. Instead of waking up early to play some video games behind my parents backs, I wake up early to get some extra push ups in the day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGames are controlling, and don't let your high school years go to waste. This is one of the periods in your life that your brain and yourself will undergo great changes, and I hope you can take advantage of these years to become the best you without the burden of video games.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*sorry for the grammar and rushed post lol feel free to ask me anything",

Right now, I am going through some old memories and I really miss the good old days of play Nier Automata back in 2017 for 3-4 hours a week. Sigh, life do really get shittier as we get older and I am already reminiscing over the past. Sunday nights are always the worst time of the week and  I was get a tad bit emotional whenever during this time :(\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know this topic should fit better at subs like r/CasualConversation but I thought it would be better if I posted it here to avoid gamers encouraging me to get back into gaming.",

            "selftext": "Hello to all of you.\n\nI wanted to share my thoughts and experience for the past 6 months, where I have abstained from all types of gaming.\n\nQuick backstory: I'm 31 and have been spending an absurd amount of time on games for the past 10-15 years. Got hooked on WoW in 2005, then LoL in 2009 which was my main game until 2015. After that I binged Steam games. One after the other. \n6 months ago I decided to take my PC apart and sell it in parts. Got rid of everything, the whole set up. \n\nI'm not here to tell you how amazing everything is now without gaming. I am here to tell you though that, while I am still suffering with life, I'm suffering much less now than I ever did before.\n\n6 months was long enough to give me perspective on things. The first weeks and months were still raw. I had just let go of something that was a major part of my life for 15 years. Of course it was gonna leave a huge hole. I tried my best to fill my time with better things, which didn't always go as planned. I would slip many times, by watching too much Netflix or comfort-eating. Turning to porn or certain substances. But eventually I find the right things.\n\nToday I am always in bed before 24.00 and wake up around 7.00. Which is a huge improvemnt considering I would game until mornings sometimes prior to this. I got a job that's alright. It's worth my time and I am getting better at it. I got my economy in order and I even started saving money. When I get home I take care of some chores, play around with my cats and try to fix my own dinner. Recently I picked up the piano, a few books and going for walks. It's not always a joy but I am slowly learning to appreciate the moments of it all. \n\nThe best way to describe how stopping gaming affected me, is that I finally made that transition from irresponsible teenager to adult. Which is sad to think about because I'm 31. Gaming had such a grip of me that I never allowed myself to become an actual adult. You know, taking on responsibilites, having priorities, not giving into temptations and such. To me, gaming was such a colossal waste of time. And I can feel the effects of it now clearly. What am I suppose to do with all this useless information? It doesn't translate to the real world at all. \n \nSo while it's still a struggle, I am feeling much better and slowly starting to enjoy the small things in life. Stopping gaming completley was without a doubt the best decision I made for myself.\nHope this gave you something positive to carry with you and I wish you the best. Thank you for reading.",

            "selftext": "He mentioned that my cousin is 'not addicted' to anything, he was obviously talking about drugs or alcohol.\n\nHe also mentioned as a funny comparison how he spent his 18th birthday hiding under a car, with his friends, waiting for some girls boyfriends to leave (yeah they were the other ones) and how my cousin spent his 18th birthday on a boring, family cake reunion at Grandma's.\n\nThis led me to think how they had a very different youth from ours. All those thousands of hours we spent gaming, they spent them going out with their friends, forming life lasting friendships, and studying.\n\nMy cousin is not this uncle's son, but he also has a son who is 11 years old, I have talked to them about the problem but they don't seem to understand how addictive this games are, and what their kids are missing, and to be honest I think a lot of it has to do with them being lazy at parenting, like my parents were.\n\nLike yeah kid just go to your room and play ok? As long as you are breathing... The classic 'as long as you are not out there doing drugs' \n\nLMAO yeah I knew drugs were bad, I was not going to do them anyways, but you know what I did end up doing? I lost my youth, my teenage years, and I didn't finish college.",

He has never, EVER had a job. Zero work experience. \nHe plays videogames all day. His schedule is pretty much sleep / videogames / eat most of the food / and repeat. In no particular order. He hasn't left the house in weeks, and the only times he leaves is to buy food.  We moved out last year and I can count with one hand the times he has gotten out of the house to hang out with the rest of us.  And when he plays he's way too loud and he gets mad if we ask him to keep it down. \n\nIf we try to confront him then he gets offended. I understand he might have some sort of depression, but if we suggest he gets help then he gets mad at us (I've been depressed myself, and I was on antidepressants so I know what it's like, but he doesn't seem to see the problem he has). I'm younger than him (21), I'm studying to get into college and since being here I've had two jobs, starting another one on Sunday. I believe the problem with him is that since he has a degree he thinks he's too much for a regular job, and he just doesn't want to try and have anything that's not related to what he studied (not even if it's just while he finds something related to his degree) \nAnyways. I don't know what to do. My mom has given up, I can tell she's exhausted with him. He says how much he wants a job, but like I said before, he makes no effort into finding one. \nHe gets way too defensive when we say something. We've tried being soft with him, and we've tried being direct, even if it sounds harsh. \nI just don't know how to talk to him without him getting offended and locking himself to keep playing. He lives in this fantasy bubble and I don't know how to take him out of there. \nThe worst part is, he used to hate people like this. And now he's becoming into the thing he hated the most.",

After I quit I felt a strong urge to start the game every chance I got, merely out of habbit, but I never searched for a match. I kept up with the dota news and watched a lot of movies and series. After a long while I started playing hearthstone wich crept up on me. I hit legend rank while I still convinced myself it was just to kill some time. I quit playing after that. \n\nFast forward half a year and I made the concious decision that I wanted to get back into dota to fill the competitive void that I was missing all that time. I played 4-5 hours daily for the first 2 months, my interest slowly died down over the last month and now I dont even check the subreddit anymore.\n\nI'm studying out of boredom.\n\nI think I lost my will to play.",

            "selftext": "I've been trying to quit gaming for about a year. I've started and stopped more times than i can remember. Recently, thoughts of playing classic wow have consumed me. I've binge played on instant 60 private servers and then uninstalled, looked at pretty much every youtube video out there, and planned my character for when it comes out.\n\nThis has lead to me neglecting my school work, my friends and worst of all, my girlfriend.  I've been planning out how many hours i could play per week without fucking up my life, if i where to start \"for real\" again. I have a busy schedule, and i want to work out and hang out with people, so ive come to the conclusion that i could squeeze in 6-7 hours per week. Then i started thinking, how much could i play if i broke up with my girlfriend? Maybe 12-14 hours? The fact that i honestly feel a bit tempted to do this is concerning to me.\n\nBut then i came to a realization, which is what i wanted to share with this post. During the longer time periods (2-3 months) that i didnt game, i felt relaxed - i could get on with every day life. If someone wanted to do something, id be down to step out. But gaming makes me feel stressed. I start making plans on how to play more and more and more. In theory i could play i moderation, but then i'd have to struggle to hold back. I know this because ive tried to moderate my play many times. And i dont want x hours of giving in to my urges, only to struggle to hold back and not being able to enjoy the rest of life.\n\nThanks for reading, and have a nice day",

Anyways, I\u2019m trying to fill in my time with stuff that makes me feel productive/fulfilled but I\u2019m struggling. \n\nI started studying some math topics again. And I\u2019ve been thinking about getting back into producing music. But the math is more of a chore/work than a hobby. And the music production feels kind of pointless? Like it\u2019s fun, but it just feels like a waste of time. Like gaming almost. \n\nUhhh I already go to the gym daily, so that\u2019s not an issue.\n\nI just need a hobby that brings some kind of fulfillment. I tried learning how to skateboard but Im afraid to get injured. I\u2019m 26 and married, so I kind of need to work lol. \n\nWas hoping you guys might be able to hit me with some stuff I haven\u2019t thought of yet. Thanks all",

            "selftext": "I'm in my early 30's and have fallen in and out of gaming addiction since my late teens.  I know how bad games are for me but I still have my phases where I just want to escape from everything and let myself dive into them, knowing full well they'll bury me in depression over the days or weeks I'm hooked.  Back in my more formative years, gaming completely owned me and led to my almost not graduating HS and subsequently a few false starts at university; now, I'm still trying to cobble together a life plan and career and I credit this partially to gaming addiction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife was recently on vacation for a few weeks and I'd just recently tried out VR at a friend's and been totally blown away.  So I bought a $1100 gaming PC on the second day my wife was gone and set aside \\~$400  for the impending gaming conference and announcement of a new Oculus Rift system.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told myself I'd take it easy with the new PC in the meantime and had primarily purchased it for VR.  But I was curious about what the thing could do, considering it was my first proper gaming PC in years.  So I downloaded Steam and a few old favorite games, and treated myself to a new game or two.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't stand a chance.  I fell so hard and so immediately back into addiction that I was simultaneously shocked and not surprised in the least; that old demon had been shaken awake in me and wasted no time in reclaiming his spot in my every waking thought and every available moment.  With the wife gone and work days short, I was going to bed late and waking up early just to milk as much time as possible out of my temporary freedom.  My depression also immediately swooped in and that and the addiction pinned me down in a way I'd not felt for years.  I physically couldn't remove myself from the computer sometimes.  \"Freedom.\"  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was a two week return policy on the PC, and somehow I conjured the force of will to call the store on the very last possible return day and make up a bullshit excuse as to why I \"very unfortunately\" couldn't keep the PC.  I hurriedly formatted it and packed it up, handed it in that morning before work, washed my hands clean of it and didn't look back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's an ulterior reason though that I'm writing this.  My wife knows I've dealt with gaming addiction; she's seen it from the frontlines herself as the partner of an addict.  So when she returned from her vacation and we were talking about our respective two weeks, I told her about this, and how proud I was of myself and how monumental of a decision it'd been for me to pack the PC back up and take it back to the store.  And her reaction was... muted, at best.  I think it was roughly \"Mmhmm.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife and I are currently separating, a reason being that I don't think she understands my emotional needs, my need for emotional closeness and support, for love, for understanding.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not a desparate imp or anything, I can stand on my own two feet... but the one place one should expect some warmth and understanding, especially in dealing with one's own demons, is in the married household.  And this was just the latest example in an ongoing saga of coldness, distance, emotional fogged glass behind which I've stood for years and cannot stand any longer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, after 10 years of living with my wife, I'm on the apartment hunt again.  I'll need to remind myself of how a lot of things work, like dating, paying and keeping up on all my own bills and my own household, etc.  And living alone again will be perhaps the greatest challenge, and I know the gaming addiction will try to creep up from the depths time and time again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I've got an extra $1100 in my pocket to help get my new apartment up and running, and a reinforced power of will to handle my old demons.  And hopefully, someday, a partner who is emotionally a little more connected and giving.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading.  Love and care about each other, and find people who love and care about you.",

            "selftext": "TL;DR: The below is me sharing and speculating on my experience of gaming and its affect on my creativity. It will interest you if you are an artist who games, or if you like reading about other peoples experiences with game addiction.   \n\n\nI (24m) game compulsively. Or I used to anyway. Its always been like an itch, as well as an escape. It eats away at my time and keeps me up past when I need to go to bed. This messes with my sleep schedule. The usual stuff. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe following is maybe a bit more specific to my experience, and I think its interesting so I will describe it in more detail. \n\nGaming also messes with my creative drive. I am very obsessive by nature; when I focus on something it has my whole attention. I bury myself in it and find all the best ways to achieve success within its context. This habit is really useful at the best of times because it makes me a very effective worker and learner, and also an effective friend. Sometimes it can cause problems too, but if focused it is generally a force for good in my life. \n\nHowever, I have started to realize that this is something which gaming really hijacks. Once I get into a really engaging game, I am obsessed. The art, the mechanics, the story. I learn it all. It fills my mind. I see it when I close my eyes at night and think about it when I wake up in the morning. I dream about it. \n\nI am an artist by trade. (I mean I am in theory.) My mind should be filled with my projects and pursuits, (and it sometimes is) but more rich games are so compelling that they push these other self-motivated things out. Films and TV do the same thing but are finite. I can consume them and then once they are over I have seen all there is to see, and I am satisfied and enriched. \n\nA lot of games, though, they hit this sweet spot where they keep me *just* interested enough to keep on playing. What I am doing is *just* meaningful enough. Clearing out another bunch of raiders for Preston means that nameless settlement will be better off and that is all I need to satisfy my compulsion for narrative. \n\nIt satisfies my compulsion, but not my *desire*. By which I mean: the story continues, but it does not end. I never get closure, and so I keep looking for it. I keep striding through the wasteland, subconsciously hoping for my story to end in a meaningful way. Eventually, this curiosity remaining unsatisfied, I will lose interest and move onto the next thing which is often an equally unsatisfying gaming experience. \n\nI have a want for meaningful experience, and many games pretend to present this experience. They click into my mind like a virus, pretending to be a protein, clicks into a cell. I wonder if years of this hasn't done something to my brain. I find myself cynical about the potential excitement available in real life experiences. In games there is a finite number of possibilities and in the games I frequent I have seen them all. Why wouldn't life be the same when this is what I have painfully learned *should* be expected of the places where I spend most of my time and attention? Games have taught me to expect everything to be predictable - that all possibilities fall within a given set of rules - and I have internalized this. Is this why the world feels so gray? Is this why I cant see beyond the surface of things, and why I don't feel inspired anymore? \n\n  \nSorry this was about quitting gaming for a while wasn't it? The above might feel slightly off topic, but I think it is helpful for what I want to say next. Also, if the above sounds familiar to anyone I would be interested to hear about it.  \n \n\nLast week I decided to go cold on gaming between Monday and Friday. Not a big gap but a good trial. I convinced myself that it was an art project. \n\nFirst of all I got way more stuff done. I spent most of the time applying for TEFL in China, a plan I have since abandoned. It evidently got me thinking out of the box, though, and the application process scared me enough to start seriously doing other less extreme things. I also found myself thinking more clearly and feeling more creative.\n\nOn the down swing I was more stressed out. I was grouchy and acted like someone who was a week into quitting smoking. I have been really stressed out lately, and I had just cut out my only coping mechanism. \n\nI got a lot of compulsion spikes; moments when I would otherwise have opened up steam; but I stood firm. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the  Saturday I played through risk of rain as the engineer wile downloading borderlands. (Ironically we got new internet on the Monday so I can now download a game in 40 minutes which is Future like a hoverboard let me tell you.) I played it for a few hours, and it wasn't doing anything for me. Like nothing. Its weird I have played a couple of things since then and its just not the same. \n\nThe reason its not the same is because I have now become fixated on my situation. This means I am more stressed, because my situation is that of a Scottish art graduate with no money and no job living at their parents with their mid twenties looming like a sexless storm cloud. But.. I am focused on it. I am interested in it and I understand it. Even going off games for a week has already cracked my habit of plugging in and switching off every time I started thinking about how I have no idea what I am doing with my life. \n\nWith my own life as my current obsession, now when I sit down to game it feels counter-productive. When I fall asleep I am stressing about my life, but this is a blissful change because I am not dreaming about sick Apex plays, or Preston's stupid face.",

The result of this has me realizing that it's the same with video games now. I'm 26 and I tell myself that I'm too old to be wasting time and money on gaming. This wasn't a calculated move it just happened naturally. The downside is the realization that I was using weed and gaming to mask the fact that I don't really like myself or my life at all. I'm also more aware of the agony of the day-to-day work grind when I don't have those two things to constantly reward myself with. I can't tell if I'm doing the right thing or sabotaging myself in the hopes of seeing suicide as the answer.

            "selftext": "So I have played video games since I was three. Same with masturbating. I'm now 26 and haven't been able to kick either habit/addiction. I have no friends(connections cant be remade.. we only played video games anyway) and dating is an extreme challenge due to having a felony from when I was 21 years old from a fight with an ex-gf. \n\nIn junior high my best friends made me the ass of every joke and I retreated fully into my habits and started self-harm. I had a friend from highschool until about 2 years ago when we had a falling out. I was a jerk.\n\nSo essentially beside just having some addictions since I was young. I retreated into them much further when things were tough. I don't even enjoy video games, but I have nothing else to do and have pretty bad social anxiety. I don't even understand how to relate to people anymore on a non-work basis. Of course video games being all I really do(that and watching youtube and whatnot) has left me with no way to even begin to relate to people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf there has anyone that has been in my position, can you give me any tips or points to follow to get out of this? I can cold turkey video games, but thats all. If I give up watching youtube/netflix etc then I will literally have nothing to do.\n\nSo if anyone has been here and has had reasonable success getting out, Please tell me what steps worked for you",

            "selftext": "Venting begins (excuse formatting):\nHi, ive been gaming since 1st grade (red alert, abes exodus, etc), had a good pal, from kindergarten, we shared games, kids stuff (electronic popple, populous, earthworm jim, jazz jackrabbit). I had such a good feeling in anticipation of getting to the pc, and seeing a bright and colourful world, even when playing football outside, or pretending to be x-men from the cartoons, with other kids, NOTHING trumped the feeling i had from even anticipating games. This feeling kept me going back to gaming until 5th grade, when the bullying was starting, 6th grade i got into a fight, knocked the guy on the floor, turned my back, he got up and smacked my head with a chair, parents made me switch schools, gaming helped me connect with the new classmates (some bullying here and there, others did it to me, i did it to others).\nGot crohns disease in 7th grade, doctor diagnosed me after 6 months of stomach pain and inability to eat (40 kgs at the date of diagnosis), it was luck(?) because during my appendix removal surgery, when the surgeon saw my inflamated bowels he recognised crohns disease. \nMy mom got me a psp with patapon on it when i was recovering, which helped me with the recovery.\nThen i got another surgery to remove some of my inflamated bowels, got through it with the thought of games.\nStarted going to the gym afterwards, summer before highschool, then i quit, i was also playing tennis, since 3rd grade. These activities were trivial compared to gaming.\nPlaying manhunt on my uncles pc after tennis practice was awesome, i was rushing to his place on my bike every time.\nHighschool had some bullying, but not too bad, i started skipping it whenever i felt like running away.\nWent to switzerland next year, as a foreign student, i knew german, and learned their dialect well enough, got along well with most classmates. Saved money from my allowance for a ps3, then gamed almost every day, bad company 2 with some friends.\nNext year i went to japan, stayed until fukushima nuclear explosion in march 2011. I did good in maths, mostly because i couldnt read that well, which was necessary in most subjects. I was gaming on my laptop and psp almost every day.\nThen i went to britain for 2 years, for an ib diploma, which i didnt get(didnt pass in 2 subjects). I gamed hardcore back then, heroes of newerth, and dota 2 when it came out, also new vegas, shogun 2. I was very anxious throughout these \u201cwandering years\u201d, but i did not feel that, because of gaming. Only when i came back home, did it hit me, i was behind everyone else my age (from a developmental perspective). \nI got rejected a few times, because i had no confidence in myself irl, i saw girls checking me out, but i ruined it with my awkwardness when i approached them (i only approached one girl in my native tongue at that time, all others were in foreign languages).\nI got into fights with my dad more and more, these fights also escalated (starting with not mowing the lawn when he told me, at 16, to not having a gf, socialising etc at 25). Now he keeps telling my screen addiction ruined me and my younger (by 3 yrs) brother, and even my other brother (14 yo).\nSince coming from the uk ive tried to be somehow useful to my parents, they have their own businesses, so as to try and justify my allowance (500 \u20ac).\nGot a deep depression after failing my ib exam the second time. Gathered some will, got my highscool graduation diploma with a high grade, in 2015, so i signed up for engineering, because i like doing stuff with my own hands. Found out its all cad and office work during the first uni year, also got rejected by my crush in second semester and failed 2 subjects, i tried to repeat the first uni year but gave up halfway. Gaming was still going on in the background, but also some work.\nSince then i havent done anything besides \u201cworking\u201d until 5-6 pm and then locking myself in my room and gaming. Sometimes also reading and drawing.\nGaming does not give me much pleasure anymore, just the absence of gaming makes me feel annoyed. I dont care about anything, told my dad id be happy to die while gaming, in my dark room. \nI like how edgy i am and my vision on the world, not giving a shit, its just my dad, he cares too much, and him pointing out the facts and reality to me every time tears my morale down (the tiny amount of it that i have).\nI dont wanna quit gaming, i dont want a girlfriend, i dont want to be happy. I wanna work something just to maintain my current lifestyle. \nI groom and clean myself, but my clothes are not \u201cfashionable\u201d or \u201chappy, good looking\u201d.\nNo friends, but my loneliness helps me focus on gaming. I avoid making friends because that needs time and I NEED TIME TO GAME.\nNowadays i dont even properly game that much, i mostly browse steam wondering what to play for 2 hrs, the i decide, play 1:30 mins AT MOST before i get bored and continue browsing.\nI dont want to change, but i see myself suffering from even more anxities and fears and lack of confidence in the future. I never really wanted to \u201clive\u201d, take selfies for insta, \u201cchill out\u201d, travel etc.\nIm afraid of killing myself because i wont be able to enjoy my games, manga, hentais anymore, and i dont wanna scar my family either.\nGamers truly are opressed, and their struggle is real. And im a fking jerk off. Kinda relate to shinji.",

I spend all day every day playing video games, however I have no real friends or interests other than games. I am a very unmotivated person, I rarely do anything if it's not interesting to me and I find uni very uninterested. I am considering the possibility of quitting gaming, but if I do and my uni career continues to stagnate then I'll just be miserable and bored. I guess this is more of a personal issue that I need to resolve and video games mightn't be the cause, but some anecdotal advice would be appreciated bbn in helping me make a decision.\n\nCheers.",

            "selftext": "I'm sorry in advance for what will end up being a *very* long post. Also, a disclaimer, since I've got blown off by people recently: I am *NOT* whinging because my boyfriend doesn't spend every waking moment paying attention to me. This isn't about me at all, really.  \n\nI've been with my boyfriend (let's call him C). for almost 10 years.  We met in first-year university and have been together ever since.  Since I met him, he was a pretty big gamer - it was one of his primary pastimes, but nothing that really seemed to be interfering with our relationship or his life. \n\nAnd one thing we enjoyed doing (and still do enjoy) is playing through a game together, now and then.  (For context, gaming is something I like to do, sure.  But it takes me like a year to finish a game on my own. I have plenty of other hobbies and interests, I've been places and seen things, I'm doing my doctorate. Suffice it to say, gaming is not a priority for me). \n\nLate undergrad, things started to go downhill for C.  He moved in with his best friends, who really weren't the best influence on him - they would stay up till all hours gaming, unless they were staying up till all hours drinking and gaming. They're still his best friends, by the way, and their habits are still exactly the same.  \n\nHe hit rock bottom pretty soon after - stopped going to classes altogether because he was staying up too late gaming to function, failed his year, and ultimately dropped out.  His parents and I essentially staged an intervention - they made him move back home, moved his gaming things to the family room, imposed a \"lights out\" time, etc. etc. \n\nHe managed to get his life out of a complete shambles because of that.  Never did get the university degree, but somehow snagged a high-paying job that allowed us to move in to our own place together.  He got a pile of promotions in a short time.  I was really, really proud of him. \n\nFast forward to me starting grad school.  I'm in a practical field that requires me to spend very long hours on campus - I'm stuck there from 10-12 hours a day easily. It's brutal. C's job is typical hours, so that leaves him with a lot of time between when he gets home and when I stumble through the door exhausted at 9-10pm.   \n\nWhenever I ask C what he's been doing through the evening, he shrugs his shoulders and says \"oh, I've been gaming with \\*insert friend's name here\\*\". That means he's been gaming at least 3-4 hours, and he often continues to do so if I have other school things to do from home that evening, or if I go to bed particularly early.  The apartment never gets cleaned unless I tell him, \"can you clean up today after you get home?\", or, of course, if I do it myself.  He doesn't know how to cook, like, at all, so that's also a thing.  He put on a lot of weight when he was living with his friends, and hasn't lost any of it years later despite urging from me, his parents, and his doctor. He has hypertension at a very young age.  We also don't go out nearly as much as we used to - part of that is admittedly because of my own damn workaholic self and my nonsensical schedule, but when I do want to plan something, I always have to come up with what we do.  He never has any ideas or suggestions, it's always just \"well, what do you want to do?\" \n\nIt's wearing on me. I keep bringing up the subject of his gaming, and telling him that the time he's spending on it is unhealthy. I tell him that I really need some extra help around the apartment during especially busy periods at school, since I'm either stuck on campus forever or have mountains of writing to do at home.  I tell him that he needs to find some other outlets, some other things to do, and also learn to recognize when things need to be done instead of having to be told. \n\nBut the thing is, since he's not in a barely-functioning state anymore, he thinks he doesn't have a problem.  He's got a well-paying job, a nice apartment, nice folks, longtime friends, a long-term relationship...people often tell him how well he's doing.  He constantly says that he intends to start going to the gym again (he used to love to run), and that he wants to learn to play keyboard, but he hasn't actually acted on it.  He says that gaming has been his primary outlet since childhood, something that relaxes him after a long workday above all else, and that it's something that he enjoys doing and sharing with me, too.  It's a special thing to him, as he puts it, and he doesn't think that giving it up entirely is the answer.  C also tells me that gaming gives him something to do since I'm not around for so much of the time, and that makes me feel outright *terrible*.  It's clear that he's not going to believe the time he spends gaming is a problem unless a *real* problem happens again like it did in third year university.  It doesn't help that none of his friends think that *they* have a problem, either. \n\nI absolutely don't want to leave C - aside from his gaming habits, he's a wonderful guy.  When we're spending time together out doing things, when we're deep in conversation, even when we're just doing mundane things to clean up the house together, I'm always reminded of why I stay with him.  I just wish there was some way I could help him wake up, save digging a hole and hiding the PS4 in it or something.  Telling him how worried I am about him and encouraging him to do other things is obviously not working at all, so I feel like I need to take a more \"tough love\" approach with him.  I'm starting to refuse to game with him sometimes and insist we do something else. I'm stalling on going down that road, though, as he's very sensitive and I can admittedly be quite harsh - I don't want things to blow up in my face or to create friction.  \n\nI'm just at a loss for what to do - I wish I was around most evenings so C and I could do all sorts of other things together, take his mind off of gaming...but my schedule just isn't like that.  Which is why I'm seeking advice on that here, this seems like an incredible positive community.  Anything is appreciated.  Thanks for wading through my giant wall of text.",

How i stopped was easy, my computer broke, and i couldn't repair it. i would constantly game on it everyday all day, after school, saturday nights, you know it. Even though i loved doing it, it also destroyed my life, and now im kind of happy that it broke. It has allowed for my social life to open up vastly, and its brought my inner self out more instead of keeping it in a video game and expressing on there for no one to see. I still play video games, but there is a difference, i do it in my spare time. i dont let my day evolve around when i play games, now i just play games when i have a bit of spare time and want a bit of fun. Now im not saying everyone stop gaming, if you enjoy it and its not effecting your life do it have fun, but if you feel like its stopping you from doing something like going outside with your friends or having new experiences, cut it down and stop it. Cause in the long run like me, im left with little friends and a social disorder and i regret everyday i stayed inside instead of going outside, and having fun with my friends.",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone, just thought I'd share this.\n\nI've been struggling with trying to stop gaming for over two years now. I'd constantly stop and restart, usually 2 months binging and then one month free, where I decided \"it's fine, I can do it in moderation\", and then I went back to it. It consumed my life each time I went back, but I couldn't quit.\n\nFinally, 6 days ago I talked to my mom (I'm in high school still) and basically told her I need help. I went and had her change the passcodes to my steam and blizzard accounts and told her to under no circumstances let me go back. I also installed Linux and gave her my windows activation key so I can't install anything else, other than the few existing free games that were made for Linux. We'd already had this kind of conversation before but this time I made sure to point out not to trust me about this for at least 6 months, at which point I hope I'm free of addiction. So I've forced myself into this for at least 6 months. I'm hoping this finally becomes the time that I quit.\n\nI have to say, it's a lot easier in the first few days knowing that you can't go back. There's no willpower involved now, I'm forced into it. I strongly recommend doing this to anyone who still lives at home, because Lord knows it has helped me.\n\nAnyways, just thought I would share. Anyone else trying anything similar?",

It's almost like a part of my personality that I can't really change. Then I realized that maybe I should learn to stop craving for games, and I thought a good way to do this would be to make games feel either displeasurable or completely neutral instead of fun. If gaming is no more fun than sitting in my chair and doing nothing, then I won't play video games.\n\n\n\nSo tell me, how can I completely ruin the experience of gaming? Is there some way for me to make gaming feel so immediately agonizing that I'll never want to play again? Kind of like figuratively shocking my hand whenever it touches the arrow keys? If gaming ceases to feel good, then I'll probably just game four or five more times before I completely lose my attraction to it.",

            "selftext": "TL;DR: I've been gaming for about 6-7 years, and I've lost interest in it and want to quit. I wanna post regularly to this subreddit so I can hold myself accountable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHey all, recently I've really been thinking about dropping gaming altogether and enjoy life for what it is. I feel like posting to something like this subreddit would hold me accountable for actually \\*doing\\* it.\n\n  \nIn short, I'm 19 years old, and I've been console/PC gaming since I was about 13. It was genuinely fun when I was younger and I had a great time, but now I'm kind of tired of it. I've always wanted to play multiplayer online games with my friends, as before I used to have a garbage internet connection. Now that I can actually play, I've realized how elitist most of my friends are online. After countless attempts at trying to enjoy single and multiplayer games again, they feel like a chore to me. So, about a week ago, I resolved to completely shut down my PC.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo far it's been nice, I don't totally notice not playing since I have college work and stuff, but it feels kind of liberating. I think I used to pressure myself into completing games because of FOMO. Right now I'm sitting in my family's kitchen when normally I'd be up in my room trying to suck some entertainment out of gaming. There's so much I realize I can do with my time now. So far I've been watching cooking videos, riding my bike around town, and kayaking around a lake near my house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know how long it'll be before I miss gaming, but right now I think it's time to detox from all games media. Youtube, Reddit, anything gaming related. Cold Turkey. In the grand scope of things, I won't be on this Earth for long, and I'd rather spend it looking for the best it has to offer instead of staring at pixels on a screen.",

            "selftext": "Hello guys, i'ts been two crappy years since I've last visited this sub. The first time I came across this sub at age fourteen, I was playing video games around 6 hours a day; not much has changed since then. Back then, though, video games were still a supplement to my life. Today I wake up to play video games and I live for video games. Now my life is a supplement to video games. Video games are the reason I exist, and life is just there to enable me to play video games. \n\n\nJust four days ago I attempted suicide by stabbing my neck with scissors but I missed the carotid and stabbed something else (probably my scalene muscles). It still hurts to turn my head, but I'm doing okay. The experience made me realize how urgently I need to get my life in order.\n\n\nFor the last four years I have been taking online school. My mother wanted me to graduate high school early so she convinced me to join online school. Ever since then I've been stuck in my house slaving over my computer for 10 to 12 hours a day. My dad is gone from 6 am to around 6pm because he has a long drive to work (he's a felon so he had to try really hard to get this job and he doesn't want to lose it). My mom works from home, but she has to do all the housework since my dad comes so late and because she wants me to study instead of helping her. She won't let me meet my friends; instead she just tells me to do my schoolwork and get ahead so I can graduate early. So for the past few years I've basically been sitting in front of a computer for 12 hours a day with no social interaction outside of my family. Then my parents keep dumping all their work stress on me and they shout at me the relieve themselves whenever they are angry with other people, and they always blame me for being socially inept. They like to brag to other parents about how smart I am. My SAT score was 1540 and my IQ is 137, so they shove it in other people's faces and try to show other people that \"My son is the best!\" My parents like to portray me as a confident and obedient \"perfect child\", but then they get mad at me and hit me because I stutter and I can't make eye contact and I make a horrible first impression.\n\n\n\nI turned to video games to drown out the noise of my life I have a major procrastination problem due to video games, though, and this has led to even more stress for me. Now I'm 16 and I'm supposed to get my bachelor's degree by 18, so I'm pretty much still stuck under my parents' roof. Still no friends. My mind was once sharp but now it is numb. Video games are anesthesia for me. They numb out the pain of my existence. Just living one minute without my fingers on WASD is crippling. My parents want me to get my bachelor's degree by 18 because they think an early start is the secret to success, and I can't do anything to convince them that I need friends or some freedom. There was once a time when I could think about such mundane things as trying to gain muscle (Three years ago I used to be skinny at 120 pounds on a 5'5\" frame, but now I'm obese at 185 pounds on a 5'6\" frame). These days, however, I can't think about insignificant things like that because I'm beginning to doubt my own humanity. I'm not really a human beyond the biological definition of the word. All I do is sit at a desk and click things. I might as well be a script.\n\n\nSo as you can see, I don't really have the ability to improve my life with good hobbies and more friends because my overbearing parents wouldn't approve of it. That's why I think I failed going cold turkey so many times. I don't even know how to quit at this point, or whether it's worth quitting. The promise of a better life is like an alluring myth to me; like the fountain of youth\u2014simply a mirage. I really want to overdose on video games. Like those streamers who died while trying to game for 100 hours straight. But I figured it might be worth it to see if you have any suggestions. I'll give it one last try and if I fail again I'm going to commit suicide by gaming.",

I still consider myself an avid gamer, although I can't burn the time like I used to before being married and having kids. I don't neglect my duties as a father and a husband to play games. My wife allows me to play games on the weekend, because she knows I don't have the time or the energy during the week. I tend to come home and spend time with my wife and the kids, then go to bed. On the weekend, I often find myself sitting there looking at my game library. Thinking about what I want to play, rather than picking a game and playing it. A lot of the time, I will boot a game up and not even play it, because subconsciously I know that I'm not going to enjoy it like I used to. I just built a new $4,000 gaming rig and it seems like I built it for no reason at this point. Maybe it's time that I quit? I feel like that would be a colossal waste of my time and money though, more so than playing games. Am I too far gone or is there hope? I don't necessarily want to quit playing games, but at the same time maybe it would be for the best. Any thoughts or ideas on what I should do would be appreciated. Hopefully I can either find myself enjoying games once again, or quit for good.",

            "selftext": "I been a gamer all my life. gaming has always been the problem. it affected my work. school. relationships with family and ex girlfriends. am turning 25 in a couple of months and reflecting on my life I realize I have nothing to show for. I quit before and the hobby that took over was guitar and working out. this was last year. I soon relapse back into hardcore gaming on my pc and ps3. The reason why I became a hardcore gamer playing 12 - 16 hours a day was because of bullying, my ADHD, family problems etc. it was my escape from the real world and the real problems in my life. I always been timid to talk to women, afraid to talk people, and I work in a grocery store, ,which should help my social skills, but it doesn't. My doctor just subscribed me Vyvanse and for once I can focus in class, it hit me. Is this how a normal human being pays attention in class? Feels great to learn. I can actually retain information. My anti depression pills have been giving me a more optimistic view on life. I been reading everyone's story on this subreddit and all of you humans have given me hope to quit this crap and move on with my life. I recently been working out the last two weeks. my grades on college are better then ever. my health feels amazing. I sold my ps3 yesterday and uninstalled all my games on my PC. gave all my blizzcon items to my sister's boyfriend. all I have is just my college books. my guitar. and myself. Here to day one and many more to come. Thank you to everyone for giving me the hope in moving forward in my life",

I work , play in scrims and play compete leagues. That is it, the only benefit I get is a chance to earn 10 k prize pool split 5 ways. I feel like I have done all I can, besides going pro. I don\u2019t think I can get better at the game than I already am. I am almost 25 which is pretty much end of a esport pro career. Looking for advice on how to quit, I think of quitting and just don\u2019t know what to do after, cause this has been a daily activity for my since high school. It\u2019s sad to think about quitting, but I just think it\u2019s time to focus on my life, get certifications to work along my brother as a server engineer, socialize with my friends again, find a girl friend and be happy. It really is a issue if I am really happy when I win and have a good day, and really sad when I have a bad day in a video game. Tired of being angry and wasting time. Looking for peoples advice who have successfully quit, and how there lives has changed. \n\nThanks for reading. ",

She has beautiful hands and nails. But the teacher knows that long nails is a major handicap to play piano. The nails things is commun with teenagers.\n\nThe teacher says nicely to the girl that her performance would be better and she could progress way faster if she accepts to cut her nails. The girl disagreed. \n\nOne week after, the girl came back, her nails were cut. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, to you, the one who are willing to quit, or on the road, imagine this : Piano is your life, what you want to become, your goals ans nails is gaming addiction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGaming represents a lot for you. It might be the only thing you think you're good at. But you know, deep inside, that a lot of people are happy without it. Also, you want to be a better person, a good job, a girl/boyfriend, or just something to share with someone. You don't want to be alone anymore, you need a meaning to your life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cut your nails**. Yes it is a big sacrifice but if you have goals, you will do much more things to reach them without your nails.\n\nAs the teacher, the world is not against you. It is wide open and encourage you to do great things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs an ex-gamer, I know that, in the first place, my old self would disagree if someone told me this, but take the time to think about it. This has to come from you. Bu don't let gaming slow you down in your journey to reach your goals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother way to put things in to perspective : A lot of people want to speak another language but never really put effort into it. If you could put the same dedication that you did in gaming in learning this second language, imagine how well you could master it.",

            "selftext": "Hello. My name is Augusto. I'm a 22 years old young adult living in Spain, but originally from Argentina. I wanted to come back to Reddit after deleting my old account in order to get some help from this community, and others which have been beneficial for me in the past.\n\nI'm a person with strong tendencies towards lethargy, procrastination, and addiction. I have problems with things like pornography and masturbation, social anxiety, depression, dating in general, boredom, poor physique, and of course, gaming.\n\nI game since I can remember, or at least close enough. I got my first computer at age 6, playing all kind of addicting games I won't mention to avoid triggers. At age 9 I got a PS2, and problems only arose from there, because I sought to escape the world around me (I was severely bullied from 9 to 13), and boredom too. The addiction and my social insecurities only helped to make me insecure, and less disciplined than others. I'm quite intelligent so I still did well in school, but my potential was miles away. I'm sure you share the feeling.\n\nYears passed, and I managed somehow. I am what is called a high functional person, as I'm also quite autistic. I got to Uni, and did very well there. 2 months ago I came to Spain with the aid of a friend, and I'm working and living on my own. Things are not the best they could be, though.\n\nThese months have been stressful, due to having to wake up early every day (which is hard for me, maybe because my mind is exhausted after numbing it with dopamine), being far from my friends and family, having to live on my own, and being depressed in general. I don't have motivations, nothing really compels me. Even gaming got to the point where it feels like a chore. I have no social life, I lost it when I came here. I am a kissless virgin, and at 22 it hurts deep knowing that relationships are a good way to grow (also social pressure to \"f\u00back everything that moves\"). My body is weak, I was always thin and the worst part is that, in some days, I have a little appetite (I still eat ok but I don't gain any weight). I feel bad, not like being sick, but emotionally drained.\n\nAll those years of easy dopamine left a mark on my psyche. Everything that is not instantaneous, simple, friendly to the consumer is left out. Sometimes I have energy spikes and can do big chores, but recently they are non-existent. \n\nI've been struggling with my addictions for two years, going in and out of gaming, porn, internet browsing, etc. and while I've had my successes, like abstaining from gaming for 93 days and from porn from over 150 days, and could do things like read a lot, learn some basic Japanese on my own, and be more social, addictions came back with a vengeance and could not even go close to those numbers.\n\nWhen I got to Spain and I got my own money, I just sought to spend it on things to entertain myself... of course, gaming!! I bought a PS3, a capture card (I was planning to record some games and like when I had my gaming channel when I was a teen), a PS2, a TV, cable setup (HDMI Splitter and such) and over 125 euros of games. All in all, I spent over 500 euros. Most things were used, luckily, and I could resell them not to lose all of my money.\n\nWhen I realized nothing of what I bought made me any happier, nor better, I just became furious for being so naive and impulsive. I wanted the things I wanted as a teen (a console) and to revamp my channel (to make money)... If only I could manage to record a single video! I get so bored, I prefer to go take a walk and not to game. I only use my Ps3 to watch Netflix (another thing that is already boring me too).\n\nWhat would you do? How can I regain motivation to seek other hobbies, to learn new things, to have friends? What would you do with the stuff I bought? How do you cope with stress and anxiety, and depression in general?\n\nThanks for the help, for having read, and sorry for the big text.",

            "selftext": "Hello. I really need help. So me and my brother saved up to buy a PlayStation for Christmas. Ever since we bought it, he has been addicted to playing Fortnite on it every. single. day. He's made so many friends on Fortnite I kind of feel jealous of him. He wakes up early so he can talk to them every day. Sometimes I overhear him talking about me to them early in the morning. One day he was talking about how I can never make friends because I'm too stupid and annoying. It's a shit insult but it still kind of hurt. I feel like he doesn't care about me one bit. Ever since he's become addicted to Fortnite, he hasn't really ever cared to talk to me, except if he feels like its a good time to call me a 'fucking bitch' for trying to help him with his obvious addiction. He's on it all hours of the day and if you tell him to get off he instantly curses you out. If you try to unplug the PlayStation or take away his controller, get ready to be beaten up. No, seriously. Last time I tried, he tried to twist my wrists and he dug his nails in my skin to the point where my wrists were numb. The marks stayed there for hours and hours. My brother used to be a sweet kid. Now he kind of scares me. I think that video games aren't necessarily bad for you, but everyone is entitled to their own opinion. But I do think that playing them too much could lead to addiction, and is certainly not good for you.  I really need help. I want my old brother back. Please, if you could help me in any way to get my brother back, let me know. Thank you, -Hannah.",

            "selftext": "It's time to turn the tables and stop this addiction.  \nI never recognised this as an addiction, but thanks to this subreddit, I was able to find myself in a lot of similar situations and everything begins to fall into place.  \n\n\nI am a 34 year old guy from Europe. I have been gaming as long as I can remember, it started with the old 2-tone monitors of DOS with those 5\" inch floppy's, one to boot into DOS, and one used for your game.  \nThis is probably 25-30 years ago. I have been gaming every day ever since.  \nMy childhood wasn't so good, had only my mother to rely on, and she passed away 2 years ago. I see now that I have used gaming to escape from reality, escape from my obligations and responsibilities. And have been doing that whole my life... In the course of a week, my mind is looking forward to my \"alone time\" whenever my girlfriend is away to game all night... that's not good..\n\n  \nI also have concentration issues at school, work and in my private life. I now see that this is due to the fact that my brain is trained to process fast and short impulses and rewards.. This has also caused a restlessness whenever I am not gaming.  \nEven to the point to where I believe that my homesickness is also caused by my gaming addiction. Whenever I am on holiday, I cannot find any rest, cannot enjoy the moment and constantly looking forward to going home.. to start up StarCraft and play.  \n\n\nThanks to this subreddit, I have finally been able to recognise this and learn from other people's experiences.  \nThere is no goal, no meaning in pursuing objectives in games for achievements and ultimately, the short dopamine shots. The only goal is to participate in life, with friends and family and receive lifetime rewards.  \n\n\nI have made my first steps into stopping this addiction, although I expect this to be very difficult at first.  \nI have started going to the gym, bought myself a MacBook, started selling my PC parts (to pay for my MacBook)  \nThe goal is to eliminate every possibility to jump back into gaming.  \n\n\nAgain, thank you all for sharing your personal stories. This has helped my recognising my issue and to come up with a plan of action.",

I would game at work then go home and game from 5-12 every night. I would make popcorn for supper or something light so that I could go back to gaming. \nWhat got me to quit was that my family said they would cut me out of their lives if I continued to game. My sister yelled and was a little over the top but I listened. I also saw how much it upset my dad. \nI got invited to play a game yesterday and in the past it would be very hard to say no or it would bother me.

            "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor those of you who don't know, I was doing survey here from December until about March. I was doing it as part of my Master's studies, and I was asking the questions behind why and who decides to quit gaming.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor all of you who remember and filled out my survey - or were just interested -  I am most grateful to each and everyone of you!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAn impressive sum of 180 valid answers were gathered. But unfortunately from what I counted out, the survey wasn't gaining enough responses in the window of time I had hoped. \n\nSo what does this mean? It means that I'm not going to be able to make justified claims in a statistical sense. According to my calculations I would have needed to get around 320 answers to be able to make connections that were statistically supported. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause I hope none of you feel violated or have lost your faith in the scientific community, it is my duty to write these things. To all of you who answered, your data is still safe, private and confidential. \n\nWhat I am planning to do, is to use another study's bigger collection of data and hope to make some small contrasts. What I mean is that, I can make some small connections here and there (what kind of people play how much in both and so on) and that way build an argument. \n\nThis also means that I am going to keep the data for a while still, but by the end of the year I hope to dispose of the data you have provided me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn sum: Hello, I was gathering some information from you lovely community members, but unfortunately I couldn't gather enough data/answers to actually say something that can be backed up by the scientific method. I would have needed nearly four more months for gathering data, at the speed that I was getting it. So what I have decided to do is that I am going to use another survey's data and hopefully say something about the people who play videogames and maybe find a small difference in the ways people play - that could lead to the decision to give up gaming.\n\nI am writing this post, because it is important that those who were interested and took part in the survey, do not feel like they have been cheated. I have a duty to be transparent, so that people's faith in science and the scientific community does not falter because of me. I have and will continue to hold on to the data in a secure, private and confidential manner, and hope to destroy it after I have finished my thesis - hopefully towards the end of the year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you all for reading, please do not hesitate to contact me if there are any questions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYours truly,\n\nHere4mythesis\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone, this is probably going to be very long but I don't know where else to turn to get advice about this. \n\nI'm a 21 year old male from Florida, and recently I've been thinking a lot about my video game addiction. My only hobbies outside of hanging out with friends or working are playing competitive games, and I spend a ton of time playing them, even though i don't enjoy them anymore.\n\nI've pretty much played video games non stop for 13 years. My earliest memories with video games go back to when I was about 5 years old, playing Playstation with my dad after going to school and playing outside all day long.\n\nI went through a lot of troubles from ages 7-8 with my parents separating, and thats when it really got bad. I got really depressed, and have been dealing with it ever since. To cope I spent even more time playing games. I rarely liked to go outside anymore or go to friends houses, because I knew that I would see their parents together and functioning properly, and it made me feel really bad about my situation at home and miss my dad, as I was really close to him. \n\nPlaying games felt like a way to keep my Dad in my heart as a kid, since I had almost never heard from him after that and had no idea where he went off to. I have since reconnected with him and dont feel this way anymore, but video games still have a huge hold over me, at least competitive games. \n\nFrom ages 14-18, I made a lot of friends, started going out more, and eventually got into competitive Super Smash Bros. Melee with my best friend, who is still practically my brother. You had to go to someones house to play and practice that game and socialize in person, so it was a nice social outlet. We loved it since it was our favorite game as a kid, and it introduced us to so many new friends and memories I still hold close to me today. It also taught me how to practice something efficiently and to stay dedicated to getting better at something, even through failures. \n\nBut lately, I just find myself getting extremely angry with competitive games such as Fortnite or Smash Bros, when they used to just be my outlet for escape or relaxation/fun. I can't even play them casually, I naturally go full tryhard when I play any player vs player game. I find myself playing them now for almost no reason, since I get no enjoyment out of them anymore, and by the end of my 8 or so hour sessions I just feel even worse about myself, extremely pissed and like I wasted all of my time.\n\nI still find value in single player games and am a collector of retro games (among other things like vinyl), and they don't have NEARLY as big of a hold on me as competitive games do. I play a new single player game every 3-4 months or so I'd say. More often than not, when I play single player games I feel inspired to create something as awesome as what I just played, like Silent Hill 3 or Earthbound for example, even if it isn't necessarily creating a **video game** like it. I find inspiration from sound design, art direction, writing and overall game design. It's similar to how I feel after listening to a great album or watching an amazing movie. \n\nI originally started collecting video games with the intention of playing them with my kids just like I used to with my dad, and potentially selling them off in the future if I got in a pinch.\n\nI want to move away from consuming media exclusively to creating it, specifically music and art. I used to draw and do tons of creative things as a kid, but the deeper i got into depression the more I abandoned my creativity and spent all of my time playing games, and honestly it's only exacerbating my depression. \n\nI feel like trying to stay into competitive games is just me chasing the wonderful times, memories, and personal growth I had playing Melee with my friends in my teenage years, but I know those times are long gone and i simply do not enjoy the game anymore. I have to make new memories now and not cling so desperately to the past.\n\nI just feel totally lost without video games. I've tried creating music and learning FL Studio instead, but I can't muster that work ethic and passion I had for Smash back in the day and power through the failures and learn properly. I get disappointed and frustrated with myself for not catching onto it as fast as I did with Melee. Then I just tell myself I'll never be good at anything but video games and end up quitting and hopping right back onto Fortnite to hate my life for 8 hours and reflect on what the hell I'm even doing for the rest of the night.\n\nI'm really worried about having wasted tons of time and effort collecting all of this stuff if I'm just going to abandon video games altogether. I don't really want to give up single player games because they don't consume me and they've done more positive for me than good I'd say, but competitive games have to go.\n\nIt just sucks because that's my main way of socializing with my friends when we aren't able to get out and spend time with each other due to differing schedules and adult life. It's even a way to spend time with my girlfriend, because she loves playing multiplayer games with me.\n\nI really just don't know what to do, and am writing this to get it all off my chest and maybe get some advice or perspective from someone here. Thanks to anyone who read all of this, I really appreciate your time.",

Let's Plays I never had trouble with watching compulsively, and a lot of the games I watch are games I don't play, but I know there's still a risk that watching them may make me want to play games myself. I also sometimes watch Game analysis videos that provide a critical examination of a lot of games, which I always enjoyed, even if they were for very niche artistic games I had no intention of ever playing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGaming threads feel like a more obvious issue. I'm following a Something Awful thread on the Resident Evil 2 remake, for example, and I enjoy seeing people's reactions to a game I, until very recently, was playing. Of course, they also talk about other games, games that I've yet to play, games that have yet to come out, and that makes me want to play them.  And of course, sometimes I want to post and talk about my own gaming experiences. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt seems obvious to me that I should cut out gaming threads, and that I can find other threads with similar camaraderie elsewhere. I'm less sure about things like Let's Plays, where the commentary experience, or just the raw entertainment value of watching friends dick each other over in multiplayer, seems harder to find. I never really found a group to do something similarly with in my own gaming, so I suppose you could say it fills a niche.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut what do people here think? Is there an alternative to Let's Plays that scratches that same itch? Do people feel like they can be watched without getting urges to play? Are there other kinds of threads, like for TV shows and whatnot, that give a similar kind of feel as gaming threads do/did for me?",

Ive been playing video games for basically every day for 10 years, my mum have told me that i've been addicted since middle school, and she did all she could to make me quit, but i just ignored it. I became lazy and uninterested, lost my confidence, became very underweight, weighing 52 kg while being 175cm. Staying up all night playing killed my grades in high school which made me fail a class, but i chose gaming over getting enough sleep and doing well in school. \n\nThis all changed when i joined the military January last year, i gained 15 kg muscle, i got my confidence back, although i lacked social skills, i managed to get a couple of friends, and it felt great. I went months without my games, we had playstations at the garrison, but i didnt even look at them, because i had more important things to do, and i am a PC gamer so it didnt really interest me that much. I didnt even feel withdrawal symptoms.\n\nI live in Norway, so service here is just 1 year, so i moved back home this january, i thought i was over gaming, but sure enough, i find myself staying up all night, denying that i have an addiction. I'm afraid that i will fall back to where i started. I'm also drinking alone in my room while I'm gaming, not because its fun to drink, but because it helps me forget how much i've fucked my life up.\n\nToday i started my computer for the last time, i need to fix my grades instead of being depressed about the past. I need to start doing something productive. I wanna make my parents and grandparents proud of what i achieve, rather than rot away behind a computer screen.\nBut its hard... Its really hard... Tomorrow I'm going  to tell a friend of mine about this problem, and hope he doesn't make fun of me, but tries to help me instead, because i need help... \n\nI've been disappointed in myself self for so long, this changes now.\n\nJust writing this helped me understand how much of a problem i have...",

            "selftext": "Hey y'all. \n\nSo this is day one for me. Or more like hour 2, but whatever. I wrote in my journal earlier today my thoughts about playing games, and I figured that'd be as good as any way to share why I'm doing this.\n\n# Videogames\n\nToday, as on previous days, I theorized that playing videogames during a school semester is not a good idea. Somewhat less commonly, I also theorized that playing videogames is not a good idea not just because of grades, but because it adds to my stress. This is for several reasons:\n\n\u00b7 Most prominently, it takes away from time spent studying and doing classwork, and less time spent doing those things means I feel less prepared for classes, and that adds to my stress\n\n\u00b7 Because I am *aware* that this takes away from my academic work, and that this has negative effects, *the knowledge that I am doing that adds to my stress*\n\n\u00b7 Attempting to balance games alongside studying is itself stressful, as I find myself in a tug-of-war between wanting to hold to my personal desires to not play games, versus wanting to, you know, play games. I thus have a perpetual sense of uncertainty and strain to balance the two, which is taxing.\n\n\u00b7 If I fail to properly balance game time with desired academic time, as happens whenever I try to balance the two, I then feel stressed about failing to hold to my desired goals, I feel a sense of anxiety over my diminishing time to work on schoolwork, and I become panicked and distressed because I feel as though I\u2019m trapped in a perpetual cycle of videogame addiction.\n\n## Kittens Game\n\n\u201cKittens Game\u201d, a semi-idle incremental game developed by Bloodrizer, offers a few interesting insights into my game-playing psychology. The game stands out alongside other incremental games by the sheer amount of depth to its mechanics, the extraordinarily long length of time it takes to play the game, and the amount of continuous management the game requires in order to progress. Here are some of the noteworthy features:\n\n\u00b7 Over 50 unique resources. Most idle games normally have only a handful of resources to manage, which tend to serve mechanically distinct functions. For example, Cookie Clicker has cookies, which are used to purchase technologies and buildings, and prestige, which increases the amount of cookies you earn. Each of the resources in the Kittens Game requires separate actions, separate buildings, separate upgrades, and separate technologies to discover, produce and, often, to store. This is more resources than many triple-A grand strategy games. \n\n\u00b7 Many of these resources have limited storage\u2014this storage can be upgraded, but the amount that can be stored at any time is usually insufficient to build more than a few buildings, or bring the player a few points closer to an upgrade. This incentivizes the player to repeatedly check on these resources, lest their progress in the game be slowed by producing resources over the storage limit. And it is typically not until the late game that converting these resources into *other* resources that have no storage limit, through the use of engineers and factories, is possible\n\n\u00b7 The time it takes to advance in the game, such as by obtaining a new technology, is often in the hours. Manuscripts, for example, are an early-mid-game resource which many technologies are built on. They can be automatically produced via Steamworks (although building the building and obtaining the upgrades to produce manuscripts itself takes a few hours), but they produce at such a slow rate that if often takes *days* to produce the technologies with these methods alone. Later on, some activities such as space missions, do actually take real-life days to complete.  \n\n\u00b7 There are alternatives to the above issue, but this requires the player to be constantly monitoring and engaging with resource management for upwards of 5 minutes, 10 minutes, even 30 minutes. With the manuscript example above, for example, it is more convenient to hunt for furs (using catpower that takes only a few minutes, if that, to reach capacity), convert them to parchment and then manuscripts using culture(which also takes only a few minutes to reach capacity). To perform this efficiently, the player must send hunters, craft parchment and manuscripts, every few minutes, with optimal efficiency requiring the player to watch the game like a hawk to make sure time is not wasted.\n\nThese elements combine to create a game that, if the player is invested in it and wants to advance as quickly as possible, requires them to be paying attention to it for hours at a time, and take as few breaks as possible.\n\nAnd for a few weeks ending only this week, I played this game *religiously*. I would check on it in conversations, when I woke up in the morning, keep it open at work or while playing other games. I couldn\u2019t get enough of it. I always wanted to progress in the game. This is all despite that literally the only thing I was working towards were some text-based updates that would make numbers appear faster or else lead to some new discovery. \n\nThis game in particular makes me think I have an unhealthy relationship with games. The fact that I was willing to give up so much of my time to play a game where the only extrinsic reward was *being able to play the game more* suggests to me that there is a deeper compulsion at play that merits investigating.\n\n## Here it comes again\n\nSo now, not more than an hour since I told myself I should stop playing games during the semester, I want to play games again. Europa Universalis, I want to play as Japan, inspired by another game, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. \n\nTo give an example of my split mind, right now there is one part of me that is thinking \u201cDon\u2019t do that Xanderkish, you just spent all this time writing out why you shouldn\u2019t.\u201d And then there\u2019s another part that is going \u201cWhy not? It\u2019s only an hour, and you\u2019ve got plenty of time to do schoolwork on other days.\u201d And this is the kind of internal conflict that often pops up.\n\nIf I\u2019m evaluating myself realistically, I\u2019d say that my game playing habits, a lot of times, have a net-negative impact on my life. In addition to them taking time away from classes, the compulsion has interfered with my sleep, taken time away from my social life (there are even times where I\u2019m with people where I just want to leave to play videogames), made me less likely to do other productive activities like cleaning and exercising, and cost me a shitload of money over the years, numbering in the thousands.\n\nI\u2019m often afraid to admit this, though. I have a few ideas as to why:\n\n\u00b7 It feels tantamount to admitting that I fucked up a lot of parts of my life on a pretty significant level. There have been times where I wondered if my miserable high school experience might have been better without videogames, and the answer is often \u201cyes\u201d\u2014I might have socialized more, or learned more valuable things. \n\n\u00b7 I\u2019m afraid of being judged by other people if I admit that. \n\n\u00b7 I fear that I\u2019m wrong, and that I\u2019m just jumping to conclusions (as I often do).\n\n## \u201cEveryone needs to relax\u201d\n\nI hear this a lot when I talk about my game anxieties. When I\u2019m feeling more favorable to games, I agree. When I\u2019m not, here is some of what I think:\n\n\u00b7 Everyone needs to relax, but I need more time to \u201crelax\u201d with videogames than with other means of relaxing, such as going for a walk or even watching videos of other people playing games. \n\n\u00b7 Relaxing with videogames can quickly become feeling compelled to play videogames, as what starts off as a pretty simple unwinding can lead to me wanting to devote more hours to a game in order to progress, or else feeling an urge to find and play a new game that I can sink this compulsion into. Again, the Kittens game is a prime example. \n\n\u00b7 Some people saying this, particularly other people who play games, may say this because if I question my own time spent playing videogames, it then can appear that I am implicitly questioning their time doing the same. This is why alcoholics generally don\u2019t get good advice vis-\u00e0-vis their addiction from their drinking buddies. \n\n## How much have I spent on Steam Games?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](nnetcfaqmjq21)\n\nThis much. That\u2019s since 2009. \n\nThat\u2019s about 635$ per year, $12 per week, little under 2$ per day. No idea whether that\u2019s in itself concerning or if I\u2019d see similar results for any other hobby I spent money on. \n\nCourse, that\u2019s not counting money I spent on the Nintendo Switch and its games (\\~450$), the amount I spent on new computers that can play games (\\~2000-3000$), on peripherals (\\~&lt;200$), and on previous consoles and their games (\\~500$-800$?)\n\nTime, disturbingly, is similar\u2014726 hours per year. Around 14 hours per week, 2 hours a day. \n\n## So should I just delete Steam?\n\nWell, I did. It's still there for me to reinstall, complete with all information. This could be sunk-cost fallacy, but I'm also just afraid of impulsive decisions.",

My idea is to bring a trusted family member over and have them password protect it. That way they are not only someone that can help hold me accountable but only they know the password. \n\nI realize this forum is mostly dedicated to people that want to stop gaming entirely, but that's just not something I can do cold turkey right now. However, if Windows 10 parental controls or some app out there can help keep me to a schedule, this would be a really good first step for me to take! \n\nHas anyone had success at doing this or something similar to it? \n\n  \nThank you!",

It's part competitive, part FOMO, part regret that I didn't focus enough on one thing to get good, and part embarrassment that I'm even wasting mental energy on all of this. It's a video game!!! \n\nAnyone share in these feelings? ",

                    "selftext": "So some back story - kid is 10 and primarily grew up with just me (mom). Coslept until he was 9 (tried getting him to sleep in his own room so many times in so many different ways, not happening) I think he really enjoyed that it was just him and I and he could sit around while I did everything and he could watch YouTube and had no responsibilities. Tried to get him to play sports but he never wanted to be there, wouldn\u2019t talk to anyone on the team, etc. it\u2019s sad bc he was actually really good but had zero interest in trying. He wants to go home and watch YouTube. \n\nFast forward to me finally meeting a great guy who adores son and I. Absolutely the most understanding, supportive, loving great guy. We got married and bought a house 3 hours from where we were previously living. He has helped me get son on a healthy sleeping schedule, helping structure life so son knows how to make his bed, put his dishes in the sink, help with minimal things that in my opinion kids should help with (he\u2019s turning 11 soon). \n\nPlease tell me where we are going wrong. He is very moody and doesn\u2019t want to put in the effort to help himself. He would LOVE if we just let him sit in the basement and play Xbox all day and night and not bother him except if he wants food. That is his ideal day...roll out of bed, not brush teeth, not get dressed, not make bed, not even eat.. just go play Xbox and is annoyed when we call him up for anything. \n\nObviously we have stopped letting him be on the Xbox too much. He gets 1 hour on weekdays and 2 hours on weekends. Here\u2019s where I feel at a rut: the kid walks around like he hates life!! He is so god damn miserable, doesn\u2019t say hi or bye back to other kids, looks like it\u2019s torture to do anything if it\u2019s Xbox. He will moan and complain if whatever he\u2019s doing is \u201chard\u201d. He got a big boy bike but complains it\u2019s hard to ride bc the brakes are on the handles and it\u2019s so stupid bc the seat is different. No, it\u2019s not. You just have no interest in the bike. God forbid he might fall bc then he milks a scratch. I\u2019m talking about fake crying, saying he won\u2019t go to recess at school, doesn\u2019t think he can even go to school, will walk down the stairs like he got beaten with a bat. \n\nSo the other night I went to karate with them (my husband signed up to do it with him bc he was to nervous to go by himself) and he is being the most bratty kid ever. Husband was being patient and helping him practice whatever move and he was rolling his eyes, purposely not watching and not even giving the instructor who is SO sweet the time of day. I had HAD it!!!! Y\u2019all don\u2019t know that we have catered to him the past 2 years. He hates being on the bus bc he said kids say bad things. Ok, we rearranged our schedules so hubby drops him off and I pick him up. I help him clean his room. I rollerblade while he bike rides but he doesn\u2019t want the dog to come bc he\u2019s jealous that the dog gets attention (he told me he doesn\u2019t even like how I talk to the dog). We have taken him vacationing, parasailing, boat rides, fishing, baseball games, hockey games, Dave n busters, movies, miniature golf, bowling, fancy dinners (he loves seafood) - it\u2019s not just about that either! We focus all of our attention on him. Snuggles, talks, love, affection. \n\nWith all that said I lost it last night and told him I don\u2019t appreciate his attitude during karate and he should be thankful he has a family willing to not only go watch him but his stepdad to enroll with him to make him more comfortable. I did all his chores for him that day and he didn\u2019t even say thank you. We just got back from Key West where we did a different activity each day, let him pick it and bent over backwards for whatever... he wanted a convertible car there, well he got it. I told him he can\u2019t expect to sit on his butt and play Xbox all day bc that is not reality and grounded him From it until I see a change in his behavior. I asked what else is going on to make him act this way? What is bothering him bc there has to be something. \n\nHe tells my husband he is jealous of the dog and sometimes feels like if he killed himself it wouldn\u2019t matter. \n\nWHAT?????\n\nI explained to him how much he means to me and that I love him more than anything. If he wanted I would find a new home for the dog? Spent an hour cuddling with him and being understanding and loving, etc etc etc. I felt so bad I even said he could play his Xbox when he got home from school the next day. You know what he does? He smiles and says \u201cso is it just for 1 hour or can I play longer?\u201d \n\n\nAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I can\u2019t deal anymore! I can\u2019t win!! I don\u2019t want to brush off those feelings as invalid but I don\u2019t truly think he\u2019s suicidal I think he has an addiction to technology. Advice? Am I a bad parent? What would you do? \n\n",

            "selftext": "Recently came to the decision that I wanted to slip away from the rut that I had been in since I was 14. I got heavily addicted then programmed and conditioned myself along the years to justify that this behavior was normal seeing as how so many other people were also doing it. I always had my eyes open to things that going on in real life (being perceptive) but still tunnel vision'd when it came to reflecting on my own life and how to properly cope with things. \n\nI would say that all I've really managed to do is trade one habit for another. Now I find myself going to group events, group meetings, spontaneous activitys such as swimming, biking, movies, food, pubs occasionally for support group or just having a drink with a friend and hoping to god they don't cause me to have a manic depressive episode due to them offloading onto me. I wouldn't say it's still very healthy as I feel like a nail that just wont be hammered into place. \n\nI am jaded when it comes to seeing friends and people I meet that are stuck in the very same rut I was in and it's almost suffocating because you can't always escape it, the gaming for 8-12 hours a day, eating too much or too little, not regulated and routine orientated, poor time management skills, poor organizational skills, poor peer to peer communication skills..etc\n\nI am tired of seeing this depressive behavior all around me and then when I hang out with someone who is in the same boat as me, my miserable, depressed friends make fun of them; my guess is they're jealous that they set themselves a bit more free than they are and so they feel the need to treat them as if they are the one with the problem. They even try to do that with me but I am not afraid to snap back and let them know their place and position and how they're not one to talk about someone who is trying to better their lives along with the lives of everyone else around them with kindness, compassion, empathy and communication. \n\nNot like we are preaching or telling people how to do this or do that. No, we're just doing things for our selves and getting shit on for it.\n\nTL;DR - I guess what I am trying to say is keep improving and don't let the pricks bring you down. They don't mean to be pricks, they're just a result of their own toxicity and lack of motivation to make a difference in their day to day behavior.",

During that time I kind of came to realize the effect of competitive multiplayer games on my life and dropped them. Haven\u2019t touched any since.\n\nThe problem is I though single player games would be okay. I figured if there is not competition or people tying me to the screen I\u2019d be in control. Then came Sekiro. This game has been consuming me these past few weeks. It\u2019s all I can think about at work. I have to struggle not to play it when I get home so I can workout and cook.\n\nI end up waking early everyday interrupting my sleep to play it before work for an hour. That hour quickly turns into 2 or 3 and before I know it I\u2019m pulling into work late, but I\u2019m thinking about when I can get out and play some more.\n\nThis is the same mindset I had with multiplayer games and I\u2019m coming to realize that I just can\u2019t control myself with game of any kind. I want to have control of how I spend my time and not waste it in front of a computer screen. I\u2019ve decided when I get home I\u2019m erasing all the games from my PC.

I discovered World of Warcraft around this age and other games.  I stopped socializing, I literally would spend every free minute playing video games, and when I was at school would just think about playing video games.  Meanwhile everyone else was learning social skills and just basic skills. I was always a little shy, but the isolation  made me feel so disconnected from everyone else my age.  Im 21 now, and I'm basically like socially retarded, and never really learned basic skills that you were supposed to learn.  I dont play video games anymore, they dont really make me happy, but that might be because im severly depressed.  I am very dopamine addicted however. I've just replaced video games with watching youtube/listening to music all day or some other shit.  ",

It happened about a week ago but the bruise is still black purply green. \n\nHes broken things over losing and will just be so moody with me all the time. I cant stand to be around him but I dont want to break up with him because I know hes a really nice guy other than when hes playing this stupid god awful game.\n\nHe has a chance of getting a really good internship. Its between him and a few other people, and they're going to hire the person that shows the best work by the end of next friday. Instead of working on his file hes just been playing overwatch... Maybe he works on his file for a few hours, but then stays up until almost 4 AM playing the game.\n\n I know that this internship would be life changing for him if he got it. It would open up so many doors. Its a little heart breaking to see him just throw away this amazing opportunity he has for a game that will probably be irrelevant in a few years. \n\nHow can I help him, without seeming like the cliche horrible naggy girlfriend? I dont know how to tackle this because I actually enjoy that he games. I think the games are really fun and a great source of entertainment for him... Its just this ONE game.\n\nWhat can I do? ",

            "selftext": "**My Story**\n\nAbout 5 months ago, after a 9 hour video game binge I realised my video game addiction that was out of my control. After a lot of soul searching and speaking to friends and family I tried to \"cut down\" my video game time. It worked for the first few days but then I quickly returned to my old routine. Sound familiar? My mum's advice was always \"go outside and get a hobby\", but each hobby I  tried was completely unfulfilling and I would always turn back to video games. \n\nThinking on my mum's advice a bit more I realised that instead of trying 1 hobby at a time to quell my video game addiction why don't I try 50 different things and see what sticks. Surely if I tried them all I would find something that I liked. So I wrote a list of 50 different things I wanted to accomplish in the year from completing a 1000 piece puzzle, solving a rubix cube in under a minute, taking a boxing class, bake a cake, volunteer at a soup kitchen, do stand up comedy, write a story and much, much more.   \nI am very goals oriented, and it was one of the things that I liked most about gaming, so this challenge was the ideal distraction for me to get over my addiction. \n\nToday I have completed 13/50 challenges and haven't touched gaming since January 5th. I still get cravings to play every once and while but each time I do I just look at my whiteboard of tasks and replace that craving with another challenge. \n\n**What worked** \n\nBefore I attempted the challenge I went on YouTube and unsubscribed from each of the video game channels that I followed, I also changed my cookies settings on YouTube so that I wouldn't be recommend any content from gaming channels (this was massive). I also added a program called Cold Turkey Blocker to my laptop so that I could no longer open Steam or Battlenet. Initially I tried to quit without changing these settings but they were just massive triggers for my addiction. \n\nThe challenges that I set myself were a mix of long, medium and short term, where the medium term ones I could accomplish with a solid week of 1-2 hours of practice. I remember when I first completed a medium term task, it was to create this complex origami model that took me weeks of practice to complete. The rush of dopamine and sense of accomplishment I felt was like nothing else. My brain was so used to short term dopamine hits that it got frustrated, but when I completed the task I couldn't stop smiling from ear to ear, it was awesome. \n\n**Challenges** \n\nOne of the biggest challenges, especially at the start, were the cravings. I remember being frustrated for no reason, agitated as I drove to work and thinking about gaming a lot. I watched [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-moW9jvvMr4) on the power of mindfulness to get over addiction cravings. Trying this really helped, just letting that craving sit with you and being aware of it, feeling it in your body and letting it pass. I would do this nearly 15 times a day, but after a while it decreases and it passes. I still get cravings today but not nearly as much.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThese days I have so little time with work, 50 tasks, job applications, university and friends that I actually don't have time to play video games, there are not enough hours in the week. My next challenge is to try and keep going without video games indefinitely, and if I do eventually go back to moderation, not let it take over me again. \n\nThank you for reading.   ",

I suspect I have a gaming addiction and have suspected I have had one every year since 2015. I don't enjoy video games anymore but I can't stop playing them, it's been that way for years. I have relapsed over 100+ times. Video games have negatively affected my finances spending $1000 on games that I knew I wouldn't enjoy and still playing them, that money was suppose to be for student loans. Also I would tell myself to take 1 month break off video games and don't play no matter what and I end up playing the next day or the next week getting crazy urges to play games.

Today marks the 88th day of no gaming, no triggers and gaming stimulus from social media , no talk with friends abt games or any such thing .

It is getting close to the end of the semester, and if I want any chance of saving my GPA (my main priority) then I need to make that big leap and quit cold turkey. But gaming is a bit more than mindless entertainment for me...it\u2019s a bonding experience of sort.\n\nSee, my closest friends, the ones I practically grew up with and have known since middle school, all play games. We\u2019ve been playing games like GTA, Call of Duty, Minecraft, etc on Xbox Live for years. Come to think of it, some of my best memories with them are ones we shared while playing a video game. I have no clue if that is sad or not, but that\u2019s the reality.\n\nUnfortunately, I go to college in a different state than them, so this is our best way of staying in contact and just having fun. At least until I come back in town during breaks. I truly love the guys, they\u2019re my brothers. But I\u2019m really in a rough spot in my life rn..most days I just feel empty and lost. No motivation or fulfillment out of life and just a general inability to accomplish any of the goals I set for myself. \n\nMy one question is this: Do I need to give up gaming entirely (and by extension, contact with my close friends) for my life to turn around, or is it possible for me to keep this shit in check? Maybe only game on the weekends as a reward for busting ass during the week. Again, I just don\u2019t know what to do. Well I do, but I\u2019m scared to face it I suppose. Please help ",

Like actually focusing hard on winning and improving? Studying builds? Watching pros play? Reading forums? Arguing with others about the game and about balance? Spending months or years to level up if you're playing a MMO? Wasting so much effort to understand the complexity of games? PRACTICING so many hours?\n\nMany people laugh when they hear \"complexity\" and \"games\" but they don't understand just how complex games have gotten so far (thousands of recipes/builds/combinations/combos/items etc) and how incredibly complex competitive gaming is.\n\nI mean, yes, it IS complex. It IS hard. So what? It's completely pointless and so is training to be a \"pro player\", a \"job\" that you will inevitably suck after the age of 30-35 and that is not a career by any standards. Even if you do make it as a pro (which is almost like playing the lotto), it's still an incredibly fast burning gig.\n\nSo then.. why? Why all this competition? Don't get me wrong, if you're naturally talented at game X and you rank \"gold\" or whatever, good for you, enjoy playing at gold level... but let's be real, all the competitive players will NEVER settle for where the game lands them. They will always want more, they will always \"aim\" higher. And the cycle of focusing, learning, practicing.\n\n**LEARNING....for a game. PRACTICING.....for a game. Doesn't that sound completely and utterly ridiculous?**",

It's pointless, and even though I feel like I'm working towards something sometimes, I always realise at some point how stupid and meaningless those things are. Fake accomplishments to make up for not achieving anything in real life. \n\nI've had it.\n\nWith gaming out of the way I should ideally focus more on gaining skills and learning to be responsible. Still living with parents, which is fine at this stage, but I want to make my own income and get a flat. \n\nIncome-wise I desperately want to make my money via the internet. I hate to be tied to one spot and limited in income-growth by my employer's paycheck (don't plan on going to Uni at all and current job is low-wage). I've thought for ages now that I'll end up doing marketing or something, because that's a skill I can learn and practise online and provide regardless of location. \n\nHowever, I've not learned anything so far. I know almost nothing. I can do design fairly well and have a good eye (college and self-taught) but don't have any practical marketing skills. I did buy a Udemy course on offer for \u00a39.99 that covers apparently all of the major social media sites... but done nothing with it because deep down I don't really think I am going to complete it or be able to do this stuff in the real world. I'm like that and have been for ages. I'm not an action-oriented guy. It's one of my biggest road-blocks.\n\nI'm just not sure if I am going to manage this. Am I really going to be able to quit gaming? I don't even feel like I'm going to delete the games. And I don't know how I'm going to actually learn these skills and make a career out of it - it's not like anyone's teaching me - I'm at this on my own. \n\nAny advice from you here would be very much appreciated. If you can't tell, I'm pretty lost right about now. ",

            "selftext": "I came here seeking for redemption and peace, I want to succeed, have an amazing life and recover my honor. When I think about what I could have and lived, I question to myself, are videogames the real problem? I might be in negation but I don't really know.\nI think my main problem is not managing my time well, pmo and not taking my stuff seriously, also impatience to make things real. I really think If I haven't masturbated and spectated guys banging girls and watching lots of sad and weird shit, my life could have been amazing, even with videogames still in my life.\nI'm also into Nofap and what I've learned during my 486 days without pmo (before relapse) is that these things that can be addictive sometimes aren't the main problem as we think, for some of us it reinforces a bigger problem and also 'help' dealing with feelings, like a lack of purpose. So, the main problem (in my case) might be like this. I think my main problem is not managing my time well, not taking serious many things I should care more about and not feeling capable of be useful, gaming reinforces not taking enough care for things and pmo ruins everything. \nBesides, without any doubt I'll stop gaming until the end of the semester so I can make a new life as I want, even if I play just on weekends, after doing so my mind stays in a weird state, like accelerated, then I keep thinking about videogame related stuff during the week (watching gameplays, tips, new released games, trailers, memes, etc.), this distracts me a lot but to be sincere, I don't want to quit forever, also I seriously think I have more hours of usage in my mobile than hours I played videogames (I don't have social media but reddit and I spend a lot of time on youtube and reddit too) I've proven to myself that moderation with videogames doesn't work for me, at least for now, because I keep thinking about videogame related stuff during the week or the game I just played on saturday. I'll quit until the end of the semester but I want to play on vacations, having moderation of course, I want to do it just when my objectives are accomplished.I'll build a new life and I give myself three months to build the basement, also I really like videogames, it was practically my childhood babysitter and fun brother (before my brother was born) and I love childhood memories of playing old cool games, I love the art, the stories, characters, cosplay and hardware, I specially like talking with strangers on chat and I like the community of gaming in general, is it all the community's wholesomeness a lie?, Am I an addicted if I play at max 7 hrs. a week just on weekends but I have them printed on my mind during the week?. Of course there are wonderful things in life I want to experience but also I want to enjoy again all about this world of videogames, movies and entertainment in general that I really love, would it be the same If I were reading literature not related to my career and screw up because of it?, would it be the same listening to music for hours (more than playing videogames)?, about music yeah I also have that problem, What are your toughts? \nI think is possible to enjoy videogames and entertainment in general in a healthy way, I don't want to compare but I need to mention this: one of my friends, the best med student of our generation, he plays more time than I do, doesn't exactly have a schedule to play (sometimes I see his whatsapp updates and he's about to play at 1 am., 10 pm on a monday or wednesday!), guess what game he plays, Fortnite! He even buy the battle pass sometimes and I just think: \"How the heck this guy is the best fucking student of the whole career and plays fortnite a lot more than I do?\" (I don't play fortnite but talking about hrs. of gameplay in general), I know he stays late at night, studies harder, practices more, then he plays. In my case, I'm here writing on reddit, sleeping 8-10 hrs, not studying enough, not studying at all somedays, eating without schedules, taking unnecessary naps, watching tv, making up my bed in 30 min because of lazyness, reading without discipline and passion, not giving my heart to it, so videogames might be just the top of the iceberg.

            "selftext": "I've logged at least 9000+ hours across my games. Video games and internet addiction, which is just as many thousands of hours as the games, are basically ruining my life. I guess I didn't have a chance to not get fucked up in the first place because I wasn't allowed to have friends as a kid and my parents never interacted with me other than to yell at me, so I had absolutely zero social skills and very little human interaction because I had no friends at school. Gaming was the best escape from a terrible reality. I didn't even make friends in games because I didn't know how to talk to people, so I was just completely alone.\n\nVideo game addiction saved me from suicide but it's still ruining my life because my grades are trash. I've been in therapy for over a year now and got on antidepressants but never pinpointed what exactly the problem was. Some of the videos in this sub (and the fact that I matched every single symptom of addiction these videos listed) made me realize that video game addiction is probably one of my main problems in my huge pile of problems.\n\nIt was very easy to hide the addiction, because by being female, a grand total of zero acquaintances even suspected I had a gaming problem, the non-existent social skills can be passed off as being shy, and the \"I'm dead inside\" look is easily covered up with makeup. Nobody knew enough about my life to tell me I have a problem. I didn't even tell my therapist about how much time I spend on video games because I felt embarrassed about it. \n\nAside from unfucking my grades (which is going to be hard because I have zero self control), idk what to do with all that empty time. I've never been a party person in the first place, never went to any events on campus, never had friends to hang out with, and generally just never left my room except to (sometimes) go to class. I have no interest in anything.\n\nI guess this is going to be day 1 of trying to fix my life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I spend my free time just walking in my room from wall to wall doing nothing. There's no activity or hobby that motivates me enough to do it for a while, wich feels depressing. So far, I've tried web developing, writing, reading and other things, but I get bored after a while and don't want to do it anymore.

            "selftext": "So first of all I played a lot of games when I was younger (now I'm 21), from like 14-17/18 years old. This was the time when like all of my classmates played games and I really enjoyed playing with them for a while.\n\nAlso I got some \"friends\" from online games too, like LoL and WoW, but those were reaaaally short duration. \n\nWhen I was like 17 or 18 I started to realize that I don't really enjoy playing video games. I started to play game X and after like 10 minutes I was soooo bored I just alt+f4-d out of it and that was a day for gaming then. I was getting more into the hardware thing. I started to use games as a benchmark for my PC so I could see how well (or how bad) a specific game could run. \n\nLast year at Christmas I bought a PS4 'cause there were some games I wanted to try. I really liked all of the Uncharted games and also the Ratchet and Clank game and that was it. After like 1.5 months I sold it because I didn't even use it for anything. Yeah I have some friends from uni who play on ps4 but I was meh, I couldn't really enjoy playing with them either.\n\nNowadays I watch some videos once in a while about some games, but not because of the game, but because of the youtuber's personality, humor and stuff like this. \n\nI have more important hobbies to do even in my free time, like powerlifting and bodybuilding, learning photography, listening to music (like when studying) and actually I really enjoy studying for math and electronics and doing some interesting tasks related to them as well. Also books are a really big part of my life and always were, I'm like a bookworm. I used to play a lot of racing games too, but nowadays I'd rather hop in my car on my 50ccm scooter and drive those.\n\nWhen I watch videos about games I just can't understand how could I play those for hours when I was younger. There is nothing meaningful for me in them and they are very similar to each other in my opinion, other than some indie games.\n\nOnce in a while I think about some older game that I really enjoyed with my friends, have some great memories and think about trying that game out, but then I realize I just want the nostalgia feeling from it.\n\nFor you out there, who are struggling with video game addiction or any other form of addiction: you can overcome it. Just think about all of the awesome things you can do in your life which are so much more fun and meaningful than gaming.",

            "selftext": "Now first of all I want to say, god dammit don't ban me. And also don't get the wrong idea from that first sentence. I want to talk about the good and the bads. How to break a cycle of gaming that is unhealthy and how to game in moderation, but also, how to quit. Everyone has their reasons for quitting. Although one thing that I always stand by is that you should always do thing in moderation. Literally everything needs to be done in moderation. Literally everything and anything can lead to an unhealthy addiction. Such as possibly... gaming. I believe I have mastered this. The best balance life has to offer. There are many, many people that I know of that definitely spend way to much time on games like CS:GO and Rust. Like we are talking thousands and thousands of hours here. I even know a guy who wakes up, games to mid day, works at home for about and hour and then games until about 11pm. Obviously this isn't great. And funnily enough he suffers from a number of mental issues like depression. But hell, he is a good teammate in cs. Tests and studies have PROVEN that gaming is great for you. Only if in moderation. Possibly 2-5hours a day is what I'd say is fine. You cannot let it overcome you however. You always need some self discipline. You never have to completely quit. Just remember that. I have been through games addiction. It wasn't bad I enjoyed myself actually. I used to spend up to 10hours a day on my pc, just grinding games. It got really bad when I started playing fortnite back in October 2018. Sometimes I would literally  spend 15hours on my pc playing games. How did I 'break the cycle'? I just simply forced myself to only play a couple less hours a day than I did on the previous week. I kept doing that and it worked. All it took was self-discipline. Now how to completely stop? I suggest you just do something similar to what I did and gradually go down until you don't play it. Or find another hobby. Something else to get crazed about. Maybe like a sport. \n\nBut anyway. I guess the moral of this is. Gaming is great and can be great. You just need to learn to do it in self moderation and use some self-discipline. \n\nThanks dudes.\n\nBye.",

            "selftext": "Hello,\n\nFirst of all I am glad to see a thread dedicated to this. I have had gaming problems since at least primary school. I think it started when I moved out while I was 8, I had personal problems and video games (on the gameboy color back then) was the only escape I had.\n\nI had my times of playing almost only video games - wake up, play, eat, sleep, repeat. Especially during holidays - but I was good at science so it didn't affect my career much. Also I went in pension (was sleeping in my school) at the age of 15 and this was a great period of my life because I wasn't playing much (instead I was playing cards with those who were also in pension - great times). After 18 I went to studies that kept me mostly busy - though I would spend the entire weekend playing I feel like it didn't give me too much trouble. It's really at 20 that I started to game a lot - I would usually play until 2-3 am then I would not go to the course the morning.\n\nI am thankful that I somehow managed to not screw up my studies - in fact I'm even doing a PhD right now, I also have one or two side activities (hiking and singing) that help me take a break on gaming. But as soon as I come home and I have nothing to do, I just fire up the PC and play.\n\nIn terms of work it didn't yet affect me much. But socially I am almost always tired. in my everyday life there are times when I have the feeling to be \"not there\" ; and when I am like this, usually I don't understand what people tell me, it's like I'm hearing the speech but my brain is not \"focused\" to understand. My bedroom is a mess and my appartment would be a mess too if I didn't live with an extraordinary roommate.\n\nI don't play a lot compared to some other gamers. 2-3 hours a day usually (when I haven't anything planned), during the weekend a lot more (can go up to 20 hours). I think I would benefit from quitting but on the other hand I have online friends that I like to play with. I used to organize Multiplayer games over rollcage and talisman, at some point I even was the \"creator\" of gaming communities of 10-20 people, which I used to be proud of. I'm also part of several beta testing groups - in general I like to give feedback on what I play.\n\n But now as I'm growing older I am starting more and more to envision the possibility of completely quitting because I have witnessed first hand what it does to me, and I know it's not just because of late sleeping, there is something else (I have slept late without playing video games and the next day I was feeling tired but overall fine - on the other hand when I spend my night gaming I feel grumpy, stressed and mind-tired the next day)\n\nI don't really know what I expect from this sub and I don't even know if I will make the jump. But if you have similar experience, tips, or anything, I will gladly read your comments :)\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hey all, hope everyone is doing well and keeping positive. I am new to this subreddit but i guess i would like to understand others views and their perspective on Gaming and any advice you may want to show and how a life without gaming compares. So i guess here is my story so far and the reason why i am debating slowing down if i can or stopping PC gaming.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have come to the conclusion which is difficult to admit that gaming has been a form of escapism, ever since i remember at 4 / 5 years old i was put on a PlayStation 1 by my father and gamed on GTA 3 at as young as that and the old Tomb Raiders, Crash, Spyro the classics like that and i will always remember them games. As much fun as i thought it was, i was put out the way on this due to a hostile drug environment i was raised in, lazy parenting due to cannabis, the domestic abuse from my BPD father, I have only just come in terms with my childhood through my Psychologist but gaming was always one thing i overlooked and was defensive of as i am realising now it is my coping mechanism and one i have had since a very young age. Parents split and their rivalry caused them to shower me gifts either better consoles than i had previous, more time gaming if i was with them and offers of better games just to try to gain my attention and fight over me. I lived with my mum and her new husband who was honestly an ass hole, more arguments, on goings and emotional abuse, i was isolated sent to my room with the one thing i had in there, my TV and games console. At schools the abuse didn't stop because of my weight and for being different so once again after school i went to gaming to escape it all, to learn and make myself into the person i wanted to be in RPG's, Elder Scrolls so on, being so immersed in it all down to reading lore and history. Gaming allowed me to relate to others, to sympathise, to meet new friends and people online. I would even say to go as far as making myself more intelligent in some aspects. Both my school work and college suffered  looking back at it as i much rather be gaming and trying to beat and be better than everyone else, or live my life through the characters i have made and experiences. From sinking in 2k hours in LoL, 2k in Arma 3, 3k in Dota 2, countless in Skyrim from modding and so on (WoW, GW2 ect.), easily could add up to 10k plus in my life. That is scary for me know and heartbreaking, my last relationship when it started to fall apart i ignored the sinking ship by you guessed it, gaming and playing LoL, ignoring my girlfriend and friends by playing with my online friends and staying in smoking weed. Don't get me started on the money spent on my Steam , League, WoW ect. league alone is \u00a31.1k, THATS A FREE GAME ! Spent my money that was saved for my 18th on 1.3k gaming PC !\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThankfully now after that relationship from my abusive partner i sought a Psychologist, who has helped me see that it wasn't my fault, the abuse and how i am now , constantly blaming myself wanting to escape. I have stopped my class A drug use to the point of stopping smoking green now for good, I slowly tried reaching out for my other hobbies and regaining my goals in life however the one thing stopping me know is once again gaming. Finish work, game. Invited out ? Costs money so stay in and game. Want to relearn Bass and music production, nah your mates are on and invites you to game ! I am finally starting to see my goals and want to strive towards my unknown potential but know i feel like gaming is apart of who i am, it has helped me through so much and may possibly of stopped me killing myself when things were that bad. So much time and money invested so is it really so much of a waste ? I have a strong attachment to Gaming and i do not want to say goodbye and admit it has all been wasted but know i am seeing that i want to become my own person and to stop running from the real world and develop myself towards my future. I want to know what you guys think and if gaming can still be enjoyed with various other activities and was all this ever worth it ? \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Mostly I'm looking for a side hobby since I don't get to do much besides school and language learning, and also as a way to make up for my loneliness and the fact I'm going through an excruciating one meal per day low calories diet. I didn't really enjoy the game, but I kept telling \"maybe when I reach X level or acquire Y item/spell I'll start enjoying it\", or \"maybe when I start hunting PK'ers/botters I'll start experiencing enjoyment\", but it's mostly just the nostalgia feeling, rather than actually enjoying the game mechanics. Also tried League of Legends, but given it's collective playstyle (I'm more of individualistic grindy-MMOs kind of guy) and it's toxic community it didn't take me much to uninstall. I also thought of resubscribing to WoW as soon as I'm done with my finals, but I imagine it'd have turned into a casual-fest with bunch of boosted max level characters and this whole equalized stats in battlegrounds thing.\n\nWell, seems I just gotta focus on further self-improvement and rely on Netflix to spend my leisure time.",

            "selftext": "First, I want to say thank you. Thank you all for being so comforting and kind. I'm stuck at a serious crossroads right now and I'm really confused and I'm having a really hard time. So, I wanted to share my story and kind of see where things go.\n\nI've played games for as long as I can remember. I started maybe around age 3 or 4 on my dad's IBM (I swear, the thing's like prehistoric) playing pinball and other stupid games like that. It slowly evolved into other games on better computers, where I played Freddie Fish, Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego, Mall Tycoon, like basic flash games. I played those for a while combined with other games from websites like ArmorGames, addictinggames, etc. And then the wii came along\n\nI loved the wii and I still think its the greatest console to ever exist. At first, my mom set a strict limit of 1 hour a day. At first I obliged to this, but then I started to stretch it, little by little. I was around 7 at the time, so I woke up a little bit earlier to play and played when my parents weren't home. There's a lot here I would talk about, but I'd rather talk about when games got addicting. At this time, games were supplementary to my fun. I was still in elementary school, so there was no stress or guilt about video games and I kept up with everything fine, so I had no problem.\n\nBut when middle school came around, video games turned into a beast. I started playing minecraft, then csgo, tf2, other shooters etc. Then when I was in 7th grade, a lot of my friends left my middle school, so the only contact I had with them was through video games. This is when video games got bad. I did well in school still (granted it was super easy, maybe 30mins-1 hour of hw a day) and kept up with music, but every other second, I was on the computer with my friends. All my summers since this time have ended so quickly, just becoming a blur of staying up late and playing games for 12 hours a day because it seemed I had nothing better to do. But my story is kind of weird and out of place because I still felt relatively unstressed and pretty good about myself. I still got to visit those online friends because they live pretty close to me and I was happy. These were honestly great years I cherish because everything was so fun and happy-go-lucky. There was stress, but I never felt bad and I lived every day to the fullest and every day seemed to get better. But, something always felt slightly off. I played so much with friends and so often, I started to get anxious, whenever I didn't play games. I got to play games most of the day, so I was able to be distracted from reality, but eventually it caught up in high school.\n\nI realized here that a lot had to change. I got into the games overwatch and hearthstone and started to play those a lot. I (like many other people) never really stopped thinking about those games. I was always strategizing, thinking about how I could improve and whatnot. For a while it was fun, but once I hit legend in hearthstone and diamond in overwatch, I kept playing, not because I was having fun, but because I needed it. I no longer felt a satisfaction from climbing because I felt like I hit my goal I wanted and \"beat\" these games. All the while, I was still doing well in school and continued playing music, but there was always a void in me when I didn't play games and today, I think that void is slowly ripping me apart.\n\nThe past year for me has felt so unfulfilling and stressful. I'm a junior in high school. I have a 4.3 gpa (weighted) and have a couple aps under my belt. I'm a section leader for my school band. And on the surface everything looks great, but I feel so unfulfilled, so alienated. I've actually stopped gaming for about two months now, but I keep watching videos and twitch streams, longing for days I know are gone. I'm never gonna relive my middle school days (which I think there the best years of my life), and my brain is telling me I can't, but I keep doing it. I spend entire afternoons and days just browsing youtube videos of games I don't play and read articles of random stuff I don't care about. I'm losing so much social connection, which I feel like I desperately need, because my middle school friends now smoke weed (and are part of that crowd) and my high school friends just wanna keep playing video games. I have such a hard time focusing now on my physics and math because I'm always thinking about music or I'm just getting in my own head because I feel like I'm never being productive enough. I don't know at this point. I feel like I'm just barely living to get to the next week, but I can't focus, I have so much anxiety, and everything feels so hard to do. I know this is stop gaming, but I'm having a hard time trying to get past gaming completely, with video games, but I've spent so much of my life playing them, that a part of me is still attached to them, so I spend hours on end watching freshnuts (overwatch highlights), overwatch league, and other twitch streams and once I'm watching them, I feel so chill and great (It's like a drug), but the second I stop, I feel so awful. I feel guilt, stress, anxiety, and like a failure. I'm having a hard time coping right now with all the stress and when I'm surrounded by people just as stressed, anxious, and tired of life as me, I feel like there's no end in sight, like this is how it'll always be.\n\nI'm gonna keep pushing. I'm gonna break this cycle one day, I swear. I know it's temporary, but it sure as hell doesn't feel like it. If anyone has any tips on how to focus on things you don't understand (like physics and math for me) or ways to stay focused in general I'd be glad to hear it. I don't really know why I wrote this post now that I think of it, but I think I want to just get this out of my system, to admit I have a serious problem that I need to overcome. Best of luck to you all that are also trying to overcome this addiction. I know I'm not alone, but sometimes, it sure does feel like it. ",

Seek the help of a professional.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **Pre-occupation:** constantly thinking about games, and thinking of games as the only source of your self-worth or motivation.\n2. **Withdrawal symptoms:** headaches, anxiety, sadness, cravings and urges to play, boredom.\n3. **Tolerance:** needing to play more and more to feel the same level of excitement you once did, or continuing to play even though you find gaming boring.\n4. **Unable to limit or control your play:** tried to quit and relapsed? Tried to moderate and been unable to?\n5. **Loss of interest in other activities:** Does your life revolve around gaming instead of gaming revolving around your life? have you stopped doing sports or other activities?\n6. **Continuing to play despite negative impact:** Struggling in school? Lost a job? Having poor relationships? Yet you continue to game? \n7. **Deception:** Lying about your play? Spending money you aren't supposed to? \n8. **Gaming to escape or relieve a negative mood:** Gaming is your coping mechanism, and you use it to avoid dealing with whatever situation you need to.\n9. **Lost a significant relationship, work, or education opportunity:**  When I was gaming I dropped out of high school, lost jobs, and lost my girlfriend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you meet 0-2 criteria that may be normal gaming. 2-4 criteria you may be more at-risk. 5 or more criteria is likely problematic.

            "selftext": "disclaimer: this post is about addiction &amp; escapism, not simply quitting video games   \n\n\nIt's my first  time posting here, but I felt that I needed to say something I didn't see addressed much in the top posts. Addiction is always the symptom of a deeper problem, and a lot of the time it isn't one that we chose ourselves. I got into gaming when I was young because I was ignored by my peers and neglected (and abused) by my parents. I used it as an escape or a place where I could be safe from terrible environment I lived in. Gaming became a problem for me as adult, but I know that I didn't choose the poor way that I was treated growing up. I had good social interactions on the games I played where people would ask where I've been, that they were happy that I was around, etc. That really did feel good at the time, because outside the games I felt like I may as well not existed to other people. This wasn't my fault as a kid, and I know that now (even though accepting it is taking years).   \n\n\n We can accept that we have an addiction without shaming ourselves for it. We can recognize that often it's a coping mechanism for painful things that are or were out of our control. I hope for people to practice self-compassion, as well as for others. I've seen a couple of posts with comics depicting concerned parents that say  [\"do something with your life\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/5am59j/were_all_familiar_with_that_voice_in_the_back_of/) or things saying \"Would you rather socialize, or waste your life \" type posts.   \n\n\nI'm writing because I feel that there may be other people who had parents who said \"do something with your life\" and then those parents never showed interest in their child's life or even antagonized them. There are people who would like to socialize with others outside of video-games, but are judged by the people they try to befriend when they try to get out there. The world isn't a fair place, and people often retreat to video games so they don't have to feel that sting. All I want to suggest, is that people spend less time motivating through jokes or memes telling people how much they waste their lives , and have some compassion or awareness that addiction often points to deep, personal suffering.   \n\n\nNow if we're talking comics and memes, what would I would like to see, is a comic where the parent says \"do something with your life!\" and then goes to watch trashy shows on the plasma in the next room with a big bottle of wine while checking facebook messages on their phone. That would be easier to relate to!   \n\n\n I hope I have represented someone else out there, and that everyone here finds a safe and supportive space within themselves, and eventually some people around them too.

            "selftext": "I've been struggling most of my life to just... float. Says go by sunk in hedonism. Gaming is a satisfying activity. It would be a big lie to say that these years weren't fun.\n\nIt would also be a lie to claim that it's just sunshine and rainbows.\n\nThe anime which starts middle school kids made me remember how smart I felt for ditching school in favor of hanging out with the delinquent in the local arcade. And when it shut down, I would grab my bike and do a 20 minutes journey to another store. When my parents got divorced they made me pick a side, and I chose my dad back then because he promised that he would buy me a console.\n\nAs for the rest of it you know it. The show also seems to know it too. One character basically feels so pressured at home that escapes to gaming. The other one lacks a parent that will pull his ear and tell him to do his homework and teach him discipline and proper studying habits.\n\nPeople in r/anime see a naive kid that's just being a kid like \"every kid at that age\" but the show doesn't even give a glimpse of more kids at their age neglecting school and social events between their peers. It's one boy who's a total idiot and the stereotypical girls that have a crush on him because he is good at video games. Absolutely 1 in a million case scenario because we gotta have a relationship.\n\nThe show is good for the nostalgia trips back in 1991. It's made for people of my age. But whether the memories invoked are good or bad depends on what happened then and how did you ended up being. And it's not good.\n\nIt's almost 2 a.m. at the time of writing this post in my phone because the thought is gnawing my head and I cannot sleep. I'm unemployed for 2 years and have health issues that made a dozen of doctors of the hospital I visited last week to start tell me to post so they can take pictures of my body because it's interesting.\n\nLong story short, I had enough of gaming bit at the same time I have nothing to cling to that doesn't include games in one way or another. I don't assume I will do it right the first time but I am not going to quit quitting until it's over. I cannot have my health but I will have my free time managed. I will recalibrate my focus.\n\nFor what is worth, an article in guardian made me think j about the reason why people procrastinate. https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/smarter-living/why-you-procrastinate-it-has-nothing-to-do-with-self-control.html so after watching the anime, that felt like I'm watching my childhood in 3rd person, I get it. It's not an addiction, it's a method to manage your emotional needs. I wanted to do something great, to be admired and admitted by my classmates, and I sucked at everything. Nobody told me that you suck at things the first time and when I first played games I was so young that I only recall the wins, not the losses.\n\nIn an environment of bullying and marginalization, where parents expect you to be a straight A student or worse - parents who don't care at all about you. How do you expect from a kid to respond to that? Magically ignore the negativity at school and become a father for the lack of a father? A single parent is better than no parent but they can't do everything because nobody's perfect anyways.\n\nSo yeah, my relationship with my games is strictly for coping with my general inadequacy in life, career and relationships. To quit it will require change deeper than simply throwing a console away. Like a hoarder, cleaning the house once means nothing. I gotta combat this in the roots. Wish me luck.",

            "selftext": "**We live in an age of stimulation and addiction, at the cost of a sea of possibilities**\n\nThere was no greater age of opportunity and knowledge than the one we live, but just because we as species and as individuals have the above, doesnt mean a thing if we can't control ourselves and our impulses.\n\n\n\nThere is lack of \"rites of passage\" and information refining, both men and women are generally misguided and we are all prone to follow anything depending on how we were educated and how willing we are to know all sides, and the truth in all of this.\n\n\n\nI just want to say that cutting videogames is a great deal for fixing and bettering our lives. By removing such addiction we will have greater clarity and capacity of thinking well. If you're on the proccess of doing so I just wish you to stay loyal on your path of redemption - better days will follow.\n\n\n\n**Moving to the main point of this thread** - The addiction of videogames is not the only front you should cut. In order to make the best use of this age, as species and as individuals, we must also dominate what hazardous impulses controls us, by that I mean other related addictions.\n\n\nI made a list for those who are willing to ascend greater beyond, on what are the toxic weights which are pulling us down in this age\u2026\n\n\n\n**Pornography / Masturbation** - Pornography addiction is the ultimate destruction to your brain, for both males and females, as it corrupts the perception of life, and makes the individual prone to obey instincts rather their will. By simply abstaining from seeing lust-filled images and v\u00eddeos you will get better, aswell as conserve and transmute \"sexual energy\" by doing nofap. (see thread - r/NoFap )\n\n\n**Phone usage and Social Media** - This front is quite complex as your phone is something necessary nowadays, and social media if used right can open up some borders. **The problem** is that you must not waste time on it. Don't even dare to procrastinate with it. Just find the perfect balance, and if possible, don't use it randomly and without reason. Use it wisely as a lesser opportunity tool.\n**(IMPORTANT!!! - Always use mobile phones in airplane mode while carrying in your pants) ; (Don't sleep near your phone)**\n\n\n\n**Food consumption** - AVOID \"eating trash\" at all costs, simply put. When you're eating well you will get good nutrients and you will have the needed minerals to let your body be in functional state and beyond. Go natural! Quit sugar and artificial stuff. And if you're a man AVOID eating anything that has SOY (it damages testosterone)\n\nIf you want to literally dominate and go beyond on this front and **refine your physical mental and spiritual** - try to eat 3 meals a day under a period of 8 hours (Intermittent fasting); or attempt to do prolonged fasts (OMAD - One Meal a day) or way beyond (prolongued fasts, above 24h)\n\n\n\n**Computer usage** - The hardest front of all, since we are living in an era of technology its very hard to control it. For this front you must minimize the use of reddit, youtube, etc... ANYTHING that lets you be bound to the chair and to your computer. Do not let it control you. *EX MACHINA!* (From latin: Out of the machine!)\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nThese are the main fronts you must fight in order to have a greater free-will. I share this thread for a better Humanity, so every wise men can wake up  and have the strenght and possibility to act against the decadence and corruption we live in. Close to the truths.\n\n\n\nCarry on with the REAL fight men, for Humanity.",

As I've wound down off gaming time I decided to quit cold turkey. Part of the motivation is, my wife and I are expecting our first child. I also have ADD so getting lost in time playing games is easy. Once I quit, I found myself taking care of the house more. I channel my energy in self improvement and home improvement. If I want to play a game, I try to play board games. Especially with CHESS which is a lot of fun! Or solitaire. My PC and electronics time has cut back 85%. If I'm doing something on the computer now, because I use it for web browsing (research mostly) and basic tasks (some digital editing etc) I can stop what I'm doing at a moment's notice. I like making and creating things with my HANDS.  It's helped me be a more aware and attentive husband and hopefully a more hands on father. ",

But slowly I realised that gaming affects the time you live in this reality and what matters the most is your life . I have to say it is the best decision I have took for a long time. It has completely changed me who has been gaming since 8 years old , so that's complete 13 years or gaming and ruining my childhood . Now I am just a week from completing 90 days challenge after which I will be committing for life time to not play games again. If I did it you can too .I am not going to lie but it will be tough for the starting 45 days but stick to your commitment but once more days pass you will be happy to have made this decision. ",

            "selftext": "Original post was yesterday https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/b7su0u/im_a_spouse_of_a_addicted_gamer/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\n\n\nSo I took a lot of your advice and i sat down with my husband and we had a talk. I thought about involving his family but he isn't close to his family at all. I did text his oldest brother and let him know what was going on but I didn't hear a response.\n\nOur conversation first started when I asked him where he saw himself in five years. He said he didn't know. I asked him what he wanted to do for a living. He said he didn't know that, either. My husband was in the military, but since got out. And things have been spiraling since then. I asked him if there was anything else he wanted to tell me about that he's been keeping from me. He said that he's been drinking again, too. He's been hiding it from me. He knows I have a lot of issues with alcohol because my dad was (and still is) and alcoholic and my dad has multiple DUIs, lost his license, has been arrested, and cheated on my mom. I had a borderline abusive childhood and I 100% blame it on my dad's alcoholism. We moved 2 hours away from my family because of this. He knows this, and has known it since we got together 6 years ago. What bothers me the most about this is that he's been taking my son into the spirits store with him. \n\nI asked him to see his credit card statement. Every purchase was either for a video game add on, or alcohol. Not once has he bought a pack of diapers, formula, an outfit, or a toy for our son. I started to cry at this point. I looked at him and I told him I'm really not sure if we can come back from this. \n\nI asked him if he thought his gaming was an addiction. He said maybe. I asked him if he would stop. At first he said no. I then told him that he would need to leave if he didn't plan on stopping. He took the keys, and I stopped him. I told him that both the cars we have are ones that I paid off. He owns neither of those. If he takes my cars, I'll report them stolen. I told him he needed to call his mom or one of his brothers to come get him so I at least know he's safe. He started crying at this point, and told me that it might be better if he just killed himself because at least our son won't remember him as a deadbeat dad. \n\nI didn't know he felt this way. I mentioned before I work constantly to make sure we stay afloat and out of debt. I told him that he's a good dad, but not a great husband to me and that I wasn't sure if this could ever get fixed. He said he didn't want to lose me, and I told him that things need to change. He asked me what he needed to do. I told him that the Xbox has to go. He told me he was going to box it up and send it to one of his friends through the mail. I asked him for a shipping receipt and a tracking number and he got pissed off again. \n\nThrough all of this I also found that this addiction goes so deep that he is a mod on a discord server for this game. He showed me it last night. He has more meaningful conversations with these strangers online than he does with his own wife. I don't even know what they're talking about. Everything that they mention is about the game. They even have an off topic chat where he talks in there with people I don't know. \n\nI honestly looked at him last night and I told him that I really don't even know who he is anymore. I feel like I lost my husband to video games. I truly never thought you could be addicted to them but he proved me wrong. I feel really guilty asking him to quit because I feel like I'm pulling something away that makes him happy and gives him friends. But it's at a point now that I think it's doing more harm than good. That game isn't real, the people aren't real. And he's neglecting real life. \n\nSorry that this is long. I really don't know how this entire situation will pan out. I might be divorced in a few months, I might not be. I am thankful for this community for providing hope for people like me that it can and will get better as long as they want it. ",

            "selftext": "First of all, I really admire this community and I have been thinking on joining for a long time, now I decided to do it. I want to tell my story, might be similar to yours or not but I think we all want the same thing, to respawn and live again. This will be fairly long, I will appreciate really much if you read it all, sometimes I just want to vent it all and remember. English is not my native language so I apologize in the case you see a couple of grammar or writing mistakes. \n\nMy first console was the great psone, my parents bought it for me and it was amazing. I remember playing with my cousins, laughing, sharing smiles and moments of joy and little stress. I used to carry my psone to their department, I was younger than them and I did really enjoyed playing with them, even if 90% of the time I was just watching them play, we used to play Crash Bandicoot Warped and Team Racing. Those were great times, everything changed a lot since then.\n\nI was not the kind of kid who liked to explore outside, playing under the rain or going to play football with my friends, I remember just playing my little violin, drawing a lot of spiderman, watching Cartoon Network and playing with toys next to my mom while she was ironing our clothes. My parents are the greatest I could ever have, they used to take me to the park, they introduced me to swimming at 6, my father taught me how to ride a bike, my mother taught every lesson about grammar, spelling and my love for art in general. They used to play with me with plastic soldiers, building castles of pillows and many others things we did. I can't blame them. I just played videogames when my cousins were at home and as a last resort to kill boredom because what I most liked about it back in those days was the connection it could built with my cousins and me.\n\nTime passed and I guess I grew up to live pre-teenage years, I am now trying to remember where did all went wrong to end like this, with this screwed up, deppresed and sorry for myself 2019 version of my own, I do not really remember the moment happiness was killed, but I am sure I killed it. I started to play more since my parents bought me the Ps2 as a Christmas gift, I remember I could not believe they actually bought me a ps2 just for my brother and me, perhaps, he was just a newborn baby back in those days so I mainly played alone, during those years I also went a lot to my grandparents home and I remember playing with my uncle a lot, maybe here is where it all started. I remember playing more and more but feeling great most of the time, I got obsessed with all kind of games, mainly because I wanted to complete them to 100 %. I was obsessed with lego star wars games, Devil may cry, resident evil 4 and many other games, I abandoned my violin lessons because my laziness to practice (I will always regret this moment for the rest of my life), luckily I did not know that online games existed around that time. So, I played more and more while time passed, hours spent on trying to get all minikits in all missions of the original trilogy of lego Star Wars, I even forgot completely about learning social skills for the years to come. When I was a 8-10 yo kid I used to have a crush on a girl I really liked, luckily resulted as a mutual and corresponded love, kind of weird because I do not remember a single time talking to her or playing together since it was uncommon to see that I guess, but despite the lack of words, just looking at her eyes and smile for a couple of seconds and I new something was going on, I think she really liked me. Despite our age and our little society rules of that time, when kissing in the cheek or holding hands when it was not mandatory was a reason to be bullied, she switched with the girls the teacher put me to hold hands and  not getting lost for excursions and days going to the park, she just looked at me, smiled, hold my hand, fix my clothes and give me a kiss to the cheek, at that time my little kid brain did not noticed and I just remember getting shocked and embarrassed but she was really nice with me, she used to buy me ice cream and hold my hand  until I had to say something to take it apart, great and sweet times; I also remember this time when I was trying to impress her and her friends and I tried to jump over a cut down tree, I failed and fell to the ground in a violent way, I was about to cry, she noticed that and to avoid that embarrassing situation she helped me to stand up and fixed my clothes, hold my hand then proceeded to buy me ice cream, that was really human and nice. This is something I lived like 12 years ago and I am afraid but also thankful that is one of the happiest memories I will ever have, I wish I could have behaved less childlish with that little girl.\n\nShe changed a lot, switched class but left the last day with a letter and a kiss just for me. I changed a lot too, or not really, I played more video games, I just played on weekends but for hours and hours, doing nothing more than playing Guitar hero 3, Lego Indiana Jones and any other games available, luckily I still had no idea online gaming existed and I had swimming to limit my gaming hours. Now puberty hits hard, sadly ashamed of masturbating and discovering pornography a couple of years before, around 11 or 12. Also came first parties, first loves and first time getting drunk, for the luckiest and \"brave\" enough smoking, and for others getting laid would be the dream made reality. I was not part of the Alpha wannabes, I was not even a real one, I was just me, me after a couple of years of masturbating and more than just a couple of years gaming and not having learned how to socialize, I had the same crush as years before, I developed social anxiety and the necessity to outcast myself from society, started to appreciate metal, rock, grunge and many other genres of music, started playing battlefront 2 on pc and getting obsessed with it,also developing deppression, akwardness and anger. The world moved on, years passed, I heard my childhood crush got laid, a couple of guys already banged her, I felt I was stuck in childhood and my broken heart did not want to accept reality, other people said she became an easy girl and stuff like that, people enjoyed their first parties, first time smoking, drinking, first loves being born and dying, first kisses everywhere, a couple of first time sex stories, some made up, some real and those puberty years became memories really fast, for some good and for others bad, for me, well I have always felt as an avid spectator of life, expert on watching life passing by. \n\nHaving started puberty with this childlish, awkward-poorly social behaviour and a deeply strong Victim mentality, teenage years were not exactly the paradise, I started pmoing really hard and getting addicted (watching porn, masturbating and having self inflicted orgasms) a lot, craving through pornography from \"normal\" to worst and worst than sadly worst, started to search for hentai and playing videogames more and more violent and getting obsessed with Batman: Arkham series and also getting obsessed with one girl in particular for many years from this point to the future. My swimming training stopped progressing, I stopped progressing, everything went to shit thanks to me, but I did not realized that. I started to be known for my whole class as the quiet, innocent and virgin guy who loves to talk about videogames an is not popular. Here is when I definitively started developing self-hate. While everyone else moved on, I stayed as the virgin loser who just masturbates and plays videogames or at least that was what I thought everyone thought about me.  During those years my motivation to do great in life was stuck and they are still stuck I guess, I once remember seeing this girl I had a crush on without her glasses and dressed totally different for a party, I inmediately thought I was condenmed to stare at her the whole night becasue I was amazed of how beautiful she looked, she was not very social at that time, she stayed there watching at the stars for a couple of generous minutes (life for sure was trying to tell me to move towards her hold her hand and enjoy the fucking night as if it were the last because she stayed there waiting for someone, anyone, to make her feel alive), guess what, I was frozen and never made the move on the several opportunities I had, since then, I just watch how others get the girl and I just watch, spectate, hear stories about how they had sex with my crushes, how that girl sucked a dick or hearing about how that innocent girl turned into a sexual beast that same night, while I returned home, laying in bed, masturbating and later crying because I felt miserable of not being the man I needed to be, I guess this is the reason of my trauma about relationships and my constant thoughts about blaming myself for not having a girlfriend, because of my coward behaviour, someone else always moves faster and gets the girls I can even think about doing something, I feel worthless, coward and stupid.\n\nI had some good experiences, like that time I started swimming in open water tournaments, or like that time I received my degree for finishing my english classes, or when a cute girl seemed to have interest in meeting me and many human experiences that I lived, but I regret not really living like I wanted, since the day I woke up form the Matrix I made up for myself, like two years ago. I regret not living at all, pmo and videogames, but because of my fault stopped me from doing the things I wanted, some of you might say but you are young man, it is true I am 20 currently but I feel like I wasted all my life. I am studying to become a doctor, but I am afraid I wont make it because I am not a real man, I am not who I need to be. I still feel that I am a little child, scared of living, addicted to self gratification, used to see life passing by and I feel hate for myself, regret of the past, I feel miserable, I feel worthless and nobody will ever love me because I am not a real man, I think I have no value even having such an easy life I dont have to work or pay for my stuff but I am still useless and worthless, I do not love myself and I just stay as the victim always. I want to believe in myself, to prove myself and everyone wrong, to make my parents happy and proud, I want to stand for myself, I want to live again as a new man and accomplish my dreams, I want to succeed in life, be respected, be loved by a wonderful girl, be admired but I just write this while I am crying. Sometimes I wish I would have never born\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I play on the weekends all night usually and never get anything done around the house, which causes a lot of extra stress.  I feel overwhelmed by life and I use video games to escape my problems.  I really need to quit.\n\nMy house is a mess and needs a lot of work, I have kids that I've been missing out on watching grow up.  \n\nI cant just play a little because I will immediately backslide into all the time, I've tried to quit.\n\nI've got so many hours into starcraft, modern warfare, battlefield 3 and 4, overwatch, apex, a bunch more.  It makes me really depressed to think about how I could have used that time to really better myself or make my family's lives better.  \n\nI really want to quit this time for good.  I've uninstalled the only game I was playing recently (Apex).\n\nI'm posting this for motivation and support and ideas. Please dont be hesitant to comment if you have something to say. Video games are fun but they can take over and ruin your life if you let them and I have.",

            "selftext": "I had a gap two weeks between college classes 7 months ago.  During that time, I thought it'd be harmless to welcome the break and play some games.  Here I am 7 months later, still playing games.  \n\nWhy the hell am I still sucked into video games.  Why can't I just put them down?  I'm looking at a promotion at work.  I'm falling behind in my college courses.  \n\nWhy did I allow myself to do this?  Why, every morning, I know what I need to do, but instead I go flip on a game on my PC.  I've done uninstalls before.  I've wiped my PC, installed a new SSD even.  My college mentor doesn't know.  I lied about the progress I've been making.  \n\nThis needs to stop.  I have to explain to my college mentor that I will not be finishing my class on target, on Tuesday.  I'm so embarrassed.  Why am I so weak?  \n\nWhen I wasn't playing games, I was so focused.  I was learning so much, enough to even get a big promotion at work.  I'm getting the promotion now, but my learning has stopped.  Instead, I'm just wasting all my free time playing video games like an idiot. \n\nPut the damn games down!  Obliterate them!  I need to uninstall everything.  I have kids to take care of.  I'm going to uninstall.  Maybe I need to just delete my steam account.  Maybe it's worth it.  \n\nIf I quit playing games, my life will fall back on track very quickly.  It's a sure thing.  I'm actually doing really well in life, my promotion will probably bump me up an extra 15K a year and another 30k in three years.  If I continue with my 2nd bachelors and then my  masters, I will be caught up on life.  In the next 5 years, there's so much to look forward to.  \n\nWhy do games have such a hold on me?  Why why why why why? Why do other people not have this problem?  Why am I different?  I'm a smart guy, just got a big award at work two months ago.  Nobody knows that I'm failing.  \n\nI need to straighten up.  Use my time wisely.  I recently started learning some new methods about prioritizing tasks.  Starting with the most important tasks, and spend leftover time on leftover tasks.  \n\nFuck Skyrim.  Fuck Star Wars.  Fuck all those things.  They do nothing for me.  NOTHING.  I am no where closer to my life goals now than I was a few months ago.\n\nIt's been EIGHT WEEKS since I've done any school work.  EIGHT FUCKING WEEKS. \n\nThis has to stop!  I feel like there's a flip in my brain that I need to reach and turn off ... or on  ... whatever makes more sense..  I need to get my ass in gear and be productive again.  I was doing SO WELL BEFORE.  Why am I an idiot?  Why am I so stupid?  Why do I have to behave worse than other people?\n\n ",

We had that competitive rivalry between us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNowadays, I can watch videos after videos of trickers, bboys, etc. pulling off the sickest moves (moves which back then I would've put down on my to-do list) without moving an inch. The truth is I feel like us impressionable young lads are supposed to be influence quite easily by videos like this and wanting to try out this stuff.

I\u2019ve been considering giving up gaming a lot recently to continue pursuing sports, mountaineering and more productive hobbies.  This has never really been enough for me to fully commit and go cold turkey but has been on my mind a lot recently.\n\nThe reason I\u2019ve kept playing through all the years I have is that I never felt it affected me really. I was always straight A\u2019s with very little effort until this year, where I\u2019ve realised I\u2019m going to actually have to work to get where I want to go. \n\nThere was a brief period where I was very socially involved with many people but recently I have retreated again to my smaller circle of friends and people I used to talk to on a daily basis won\u2019t even say hi to me anymore. Even within my smaller group i barely talk to them anymore. \n\nVery recently, just last week, I started a gaming community hosting multiplayer servers and have spent a lot of time and effort building the community snd facilitating it. So much so, I feel that simply giving up at this point would be a massive waste of my energy as it\u2019s not self sufficient yet and would likely dissipate without my continued attention. This is likely the cause of my recent withdrawal from my closer friend group. \n\nI\u2019m looking for advice or past experiences of people who might be in the same place as me or have been in the past, looking to be more social again, take up my interests again and importantly start working for my finals.\n\nI don\u2019t want to give up fully so the effort I\u2019ve put in to making this community isn\u2019t wasted, but I feel like that\u2019s what I need to do?\n\nThanks for your time.",

His game of choice is Destiny. He doesn't work, he stopped going to school. He's now a Stay At Home dad. Once our son is in bed, it's game on from 630pm-midnight. Weekends are worse. I'm killing myself working overtime 45-55+ hours a week to afford the bills, save for a home, and provide for my family. He spends money we don't have on gaming. I literally cannot afford his habit. I'm stretched so thin financially and I told him today that he will just have to make minimum payments on his credit card because I literally can not pay it off. \n\nSo from a wife of an addicted gamer, thank you for taking the steps to improve yourself. Thank you for noticing your behavior. I'm hoping I'll find my husband on this sub one day. I really really hope I do. ",

            "selftext": "TL;DR: Thinking about playing games strictly once or twice a week and uploading Let's Play's onto YouTube after my 90 Days is up. Should I do it or is this a bad idea? \n\nI know this is possibly the dumbest sounding question ever asked on this sub, but I'm strongly considering it. The benefits that I can see would be that I would actually be creating *something* instead of just consuming video games. My channel strategy would be to just play 1 or 2 sports video games that I love and upload once or twice a week. The sports are ones where I can't play in the real world for a multitude of reasons. Maybe the reason I want to even do this is to come to terms with that, but I don't know. \n\nI have *not* yet undergone a successful 90 day detox, and would only begin the channel after having done so. The reasons I failed my 90 day detox were because I didn't replace my gaming habit with good habits, and that I mistakenly thought that the Solitaire app was safe. It wasn't for me. After I got bored with Solitaire I justified downloading more gaming apps and went downhill from there. Also, I suspect the ease with starting a new Solitaire game after getting stuck and then eventually having the cards flying into the piles after winning is an easy dopamine hit. Fortunately I didn't start playing any PC games or console games again.\n\nI also spend a lot of time surfing the internet, on social media, and watching YouTube videos, which is why I'm a member of NoSurf here on Reddit, but I'm finding that starting that process is a lot more difficult than quitting gaming was.\n\nI'd like to hear what your thoughts are about this. I'll be starting my 90 days from this day forward and have deleted all the games I had downloaded onto my phone since I last attempted a 90 day detox. I don't ever watch gaming videos on YouTube or Twitch streamers or anything like that, and the only video games I would be playing after the 90 days would be the games for the channel once or twice a week at scheduled times, Brain Age on the Nintendo DSi in the morning and in the evening (which I plan on continuing during the actual 90 days because it's actually somewhat healthy), and then games that are local non internet multiplayer (in the same room), like if I'm with friends and they want to play Smash Bros or Mario Kart or something. \n\nSo that's my plan. What do you think? Is it a healthy or realistic way to game, or is it too easy of a way to fall back down the rabbit hole? ",

I'm married, so no more of those gross 10-hour gaming binges, but I'm still struggling with productivity, as I have for the last decade or so. Looked around this sub a bit and read a few articles, so I'm going to give the detox a shot.\n\nLooks like I'm a bit of an anomaly in that I don't game for social reasons. I didn't like being on servers where I could lose all my stuff/progress due to a reset or attack, and I never was any good at the popular real-time games.\n\nI like a few genres of video games. The reason why I'm here is Incremental/Idle games like Cookie Clicker. They make you think \"oh, I'll just play for a while, and then I can let the game play itself for that dopamine rush\" but they ALWAYS require some micromanaging and they wind up taking a deceptive amount of time. I just did a hard reset for NGU Idle and Idle Loops, which were my two big time sinks. They also don't really have an end, so while I really like playing them, I don't want to go back to them ever again.\n\nI also like indie sandbox games like Minecraft and Terraria. I like the creativity of these games, and I love planning on paper the next steps to take, or planning out a cool base design. I'd actually like to go back to those games after my detox. I was thinking of just quitting my idle games, but I read a comment here explaining that just limiting gaming still has the same problem with your brain wanting the quick fix, so I decided to go all-in for the 90 days. After my brain's gotten used to a bunch of real-life accomplishments, maybe I can reintroduce gaming as it's supposed to be; a minor recreational activity. But I'll definitely cautious about it.\n\n-----\n\nI've read the guide and starting articles, got my badge set up, and joined the Discord.\n\nI'm going to college and I'm not doing great this semester, so I'll need to get caught up on old assignments and hopefully pass all my classes. I'm a computer science major, and I'd like to do some personal programming projects for fun. Unfortunately, I wanted to program video games, and I'm not sure if that goes against the spirit of the detox. Is it okay to program games while doing a detox myself? If not, what sort of other programming projects should I get into? It's something I'll have to think about, but I'm looking forward to the detox and seeing how things change for me.",

            "selftext": "I love grinding in OSRS. There is a concept called \"EHP\" which translates to \"Efficient Hours Played,\" which is the estimated experience gained per hour if using the best method, and focusing enough to get the best rates. If 100k xp/hr is efficient, then 100k xp would be 1EHP, 90k .9EHP, etc.\n\nI want to be good at the game and I want to be part of the high level community who can consistently get these rates. I am 26 years old and working though, so it sometimes feels impossible to keep up. There are ways to \"buffer\" numbers such as spending time getting afk experience through something in game when you can't actually play, requiring you to screen share to your phone from your PC or logging into the mobile app. People will say it doesn't require much effort at all, but I felt tethered to my phone every time I tried.\n\nI keep on feeling the desire to go for \"big days\" or \"big weeks\", aka going for 50-70EHP weeks. I never get close though because of real life obligations or just feeling demotivated when I try, because it would require me to barely move from my PC for 8+ hours a day. This feels impossible to keep up, but I still have this desire to be part of the community somehow, like it would impress others and stuff. At the same time I wonder if my efforts are being wasted impressing people who don't have full time jobs or full time schooling. \n\nI feel torn on what to do.

            "selftext": "It's funny how \"real gambling\" is heavily regulated but anything except it is no mans land. You're probably thinking of the Loot Boxes system when I mention gambling in games and while that system is most certainly gambling, that's just the tip and the most obvious part of the iceberg.\n\nThe real gambling has been happening in games for a long time, now it's just more obvious because many new games do not have an ending anymore and they just stretch the random generator further.\n\nOk, but what does that have to do with gambling you may wonder. Well, gambling is all about (1) reward and (2) chance/randomness. Many times there would be a (3) cost involved for gambling, which in games doesn't necessarily involve real cash but lots of time and effort. We'll ignore the cost for now and focus on reward and randomness.\n\nSo now... the looting system. When you think \"loot\" you probably just think \"opening a chest\". That's what I used to think as well but very recently I played Diablo 3 demo specifically focusing on what drives me to game. The thing is, chests are a very, very small part of reward/randomness aka gambling.\n\nThe act itself of killing mobs is pulling the lever on the slot machine. **The mob itself is a chest you open.** Each mob you kill is a game on the slot machine - you instinctively know it: each mob has a chance to drop good loot, usually depending on level and so many other factors. Basically each run in a dungeon is actually a game of thousands of level pulls, which is crazy if you think of it.\n\nThen you have the stats generator, which adds a new complex layer to randomness. As you many have heard, Borderlands 3 has been recently announced and one thing from the trailer stuck with me: \"Over one Billion guns\" - they said. And that got me thinking, isn't this what most (looting) games have had already? Yes, maybe borderlands came up with a more ingenious naming generator or something, but even since Diablo 2 or earlier we've been having millions or billions of weapons - the generator for stats and all the combinations it ensued gave us a ridiculous amount of options.\n\nSo now, the reward itself is random as well. You can't do runs until you get the \"perfect item\" because the perfect item doesn't exist. There will ALWAYS be a chance to get a better item with better stats. An identical item but with better stats. Now the race isn't about pulling the lever until you get \"Immortal King's X something\" or whatever and then stop. Because each iteration of that item is different.\n\nSo you're faced with a layered gambling system:\n\n1. you gamble when you go around randomly generated instances to find the mobs.\n\n2. you gamble when you kill the mobs to get the loot\n\n3. you gamble when you get a good item because the item itself, even if it's \"epic/legendary\" has to roll good stats.\n\nIf you break all games that involve loot you will see how incredibly random the reward is and how much the reward varies.\n\nThere is obviously a hidden mechanic that makes us play games because gaming is in essence an extremely tedious and repetitive task.\n",

Cam has made more \"how to quit gaming\" content than anyone I am aware of, so it's natural that it gets linked a lot here. However, some people feel like we've gone over the line into shilling territory.\n\nI feel like some of it's unquestionably beneficial like game quitters offers [daily journals](https://forum.gamequitters.com/index.php?/forum/11-daily-journals/). Reddit just doesn't work for content like that. However, other content is much closer to the line. \n\nWhat do you think is over the line and what do you think is acceptable?",

            "selftext": "I\u2019m 27 years old and I\u2019ve been addicted to games ever since my friend introduced me to runescape many many years ago. It got so bad back then that I put no focus into my education and ended up leaving school with 0 qualifications. I ended up working in a low playing job for a couple of years and played games any chance I got. I never really socialised unless it was speaking to someone over Xbox. In recent years, I began evaluating my situation and decided to go back into education. I limited my gaming time and went back to college and got a level 3 qualification. Last year, I started university and have been achieving a first up until this point. \n\nHowever, over the past couple of months I\u2019ve began to slip. I\u2019ve been spending more and more time playing Xbox and less time studying. I\u2019m missing lectures and have assignments due in the next couple of days, but I don\u2019t even know where to start.  I feel like I\u2019m self destructing and I know it\u2019s because all I want to do is play games! All I\u2019m doing is eating junk food, drinking energy drinks and gaming. When I set aside time last year to study, I was working out, eating healthy and was happy. I actually went from 105KG to 80KG during that time, but have since put on 10KG again, which is making me down. \n\nI trying telling myself just a bit of gaming won\u2019t hurt, but I end up playing the entire day. I\u2019m honesty out of control. It has to be all or nothing with me. I really don\u2019t know what to do. A part of me wants to get rid of all my consoles and gaming accounts and get up and do something productive. I just don\u2019t know what\u2019s holding me back. I\u2019ve worked so hard to get to the position I\u2019m in right now, but feel like I\u2019m slowly running it and falling into old bad habits. ",

            "selftext": "I noticed that whenever I game on my PC, I just never enjoy myself. I am always fiddling with graphical settings to get the best FPS, wondering if I can get a better overclock on my CPU or GPU. Fiddling with MSI afterburner to monitor my temps, tightening my RAM timings in the bios to see if I can get a better FPS. I think It hit me the other day when I was playing Assassin's Creed Oddeysey and my FPS dropped from like 70fps to 57 for a couple seconds, long enough to feel the difference,  and I deemed it \"unplayable\" and immediately uninstalled the game and told myself the game optimisation being bad was the reason I don't like it. I also notice I hardly spend time actually gaming, If I am not going through the .ini files too look for settings to boost my FPS, i am looking at prices of new components to improve my performance.   \n\n  \nAnyway, I sold my PC and my gaming peripherals a couple days ago and I am like \u00a32000 richer. Anyway I just wanted to share my addiction to not actually gaming but tinkering with my PC and games to make them run better and not actually playing them!. What are your thoughts and anyone else with similar experiences? If your like me I unsubbed from r/pcgaming, r/pcmasterrace, r/overclocking, r/amd,  r/intel and r/nvidia.",

            "selftext": "I just graduated and moved across the country to DC to start a new job. I've been working here for about 2 months now. However, unfortunately I didn't leave behind my bad habits, and basically from the time I get off work until I sleep (about 5hrs) I have been playing games. \n\nI've been kinda dissatisfied with this lifestyle for a while now but just ignoring the problem. I've been gaming heavily the last 10 years or so and it's really impacted my life negatively in terms of grades, the relationships I have with my family, making friends, and being healthy. For example, I've been in a new city for 2 months and know nobody. I have no friends to speak of. I do nothing after work except game sleep repeat. I've even been late for work several times because of staying up too late gaming!\n\nI've tried to quit before, but the problem is, I just don't know what to do with my time. Sure, I can spend 1-2 hrs exercising a day and that will help, but that still leaves me 3-4 hours a day of nothing, and 12+ hours on the weekends. I end up mindlessly surfing reddit, watching TV, or excessively reading fantasy/sci-fi books, neither of which I think are much healthier than gaming, then when I realize this, revert back to binge gaming.\n\nToday, I got home and my power supply had somehow overheated and completely fried my motherboard of my laptop overnight. I was upset, but meaning to upgrade my computer with that first job money anyway so I spent 5hrs researching a PC build and putting together a parts list. I was about to order it but then realized my completed build is over $2000. \n\nWhat the fuck am I even doing? This is my chance to escape. If I buy a $2000 gaming PC its effectively admitting I'm gaming for life and committing to this lifestyle, this lifestyle I hate. I don't have a computer I can game on right now, it would be a lot easier to quit now. It's just really hard, you know? How can I meet new friends in a new city when I have anxiety about approaching new people or going out on my own, and end up drinking solo at a bar? How can I develop longterm hobbies if everything I try I do for 1-3 months then get bored and drop it? I really want to give it a shot this time but I'm afraid it will just end up the same way, and in a month or two I'll find myself pulling up my pcpartpicker list and ordering.",

I had a lot of issues fitting in for the first year because I totally lacked social maturity and self-discipline - which I completely blame on my gaming addiction.  I then proceeded to forget about games, and focused and started doing super-stellar in school.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the second part of my junior (3rd) year - the most critical semester for graduate school, professional school (law, medicine, etc.) - I almost flunked out because I discovered text-based online games - this was 1993 and the Internet just took off.  I spent so much time that I destroyed my career.  To this day - twenty five years later - I'm still suffering from this damage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe amount of time I have spent gaming - I could have worked somewhere (even if just for fun) - I could have traveled, read, exercised, found relationships - started a business - just about anything else that would have had made my life more productive.  I've lost probably 5-10 years of my productive life due to gaming.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe problem is - time doesn't stop for anyone, even as I struggle to quit gaming.  I grow old each day, and I regret the massive amount of hours in the past I have spent gaming, and the hours that I am continuing to struggle to curtail.  I am hoping to be a new first-time father soon (at age 46), and just only recently got married a couple of years ago. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn today's world, you are competing with everyone else for jobs, education, skills, and so forth.  All gaming does is isolate you into a cocoon from society - and the gaps become glaringly evident.  It's really difficult to recover from all the personal and professional damage done by gaming - especially during the teens and twenties when academic scores, serious work, etc. all count heavily.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wish each and every one of you success in quitting this monster called video gaming.  I am truly one of the first pioneers in all generations to have gone though decades of this addiction - and I can tell you it sucks.  It doesn't get better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Up until recently, I've always been on top of my shit and never missed an assignment. Now all I do is watch TV or play video games and avoid talking to people at all costs. My routine is as follows: wake up just in time to walk to class (often miss my morning lecture)&gt;grab a bite to eat&gt;head back to my apartment&gt;do minuscule work and play video games for 6+ hours until I feel like I'm tired. Repeat. I have little to none social interactions and I should because I'm surrounded by it. I seriously don't know what happened. Last semester I used to go to the gym nearly everyday and be an active member in various clubs. The semester before that one I went to college parties every other weekend and had  ton of fun memories with friends. I may or may not be addicted to video games I really don't know for sure what is going on. I haven't read any of my books for the past 2 months and starting to get seriously bad grades. I always wanted to go to a top law school but now am facing serious mental health issues. I have an 8 page paper due in 12 hours and I can't even bring myself to even start it. ",

If you're fan the command line, Mac comes with a Unix shell and also has a third-party package manager called `brew` that can install anything under the sun with one shell command.\n\nYou know what Mac doesn't have? *Fuckin video games*. Most video games are unavailable for mac and even when they are, the port is almost always a gimped version with shitty performance. Not only that, Apple is going to make this situation even worse by forcing game devs to use Apple's own proprietary API to make games for Mac now. Safe to say that gaming on mac is all but dead.\n\nNow you could easily keep a Windows partition if you don't want to give up gaming completely but once you get start using Mac all the time, you're not going to want to want to stop what you're doing, close everything, restart your computer, and boot into windows just for some shitty video game. **It forces you to make a conscious choice every time you do want to waste time on vidya.**\n\nAnyway, if the idea of using Mac sounds appealing to you, do consider turning your PC into a hackintosh. /r/hackintosh is a great place to get started and their Discord has some very helpful people if you get stuck. Honestly though, as long as you know how to do research and follow instructions, hackintoshing is much less difficult than you think.",

Being already 22 without much to show I would really like to succeed for once at something in my life besides video games.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll my friends game a lot and It seems like I would end up losing all my friends if I quit completly.\n\nI would like to know if I should just quit altogether or have a playtime limit everyday, right now I'm using a software to block all my games if I play for more than 2hours in a day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you in advance.",

For the past few years I've struggled to hold a job, only having 1 full-time for 3 months during that entire period.  I'm completely dependent on my parent's income and them allowing me to live at home.  I've been applying to jobs for the past month or so and have done several interviews, but I've been rejected by them all.\n\nI guess living like a hermit and doing nothing but playing games all day really didn't do anything good for my social skills.  I'm still applying and I'm not going to give up, but it's still hard knowing that I'm struggling to get a very basic, entry level job.  \n\nOn the positive side of things I started working out a few months ago and just recently started ramping up my workouts.  Plus I'm eating a lot healthier now too so that's helped quite a bit.  I'm starting to see noticeable changes in my body which I'm pretty happy about.\n\nI still get the urges though.  There's still some part of me that wants the stress of where I'm at now to go away.  I want so badly to get my finances in order, pay off debts, and just start moving forward.  I want to be able to help my family and try to help them set things in order too, but that's just too many steps ahead of where I'm at right now to even consider.\n\nAny advice?  Can real life get any better and actually be exciting or am I just spinning my wheels?  I've gamed since I was probably 7 or 8 and I distinctly remember feeling like life in comparison was very boring.  I'm trying to move forward but I've been pretty sad these past few weeks.",

            "selftext": "I was rejected from most of the universities I applied to. Denied all full scholarships except some partial ones. Note that even though I was successful in quitting video games, the damage it had caused was catastrophic. I was crestfallen when I received the news. My mind was flooded with regret and angst. I did so well in middle school but in my country, if you perform poorly in your senior year, you don\u2019t get to go to good colleges. So, here I am, stressing out over my options to further my studies. And it will cost my parents a fortune.\n\nHonestly, fuck my ignorant self during high school for staying up late and skipping school to play.\n\nSo, please. If you\u2019re reading this and still in school, struggling with some sort of compulsion or gaming addiction, please get your shit together right now and cut all ties with gaming. \n\nSell your gaming rigs and get an ultra book with minimal gpu (you still need it for productivity). Trust me, if you\u2019re in the late stage of gaming addiction, moderation is no longer an option. If you really want to escape from the vicious cycle, the future is going to be difficult. You will relapse for the umpteenth time and you\u2019re going to suffer from depression-like symptoms. Infinite pain and frustration. Hate to tell you, I felt like a drug addict. I seriously couldn\u2019t understand why gaming disorder isn\u2019t labeled as a cognitive disorder yet. \n\nLet\u2019s hold each other accountable. Keep making all those motivational posts every day. I urge you guys to keep this sub active. So people can have their daily dose of motivation. But at the same time, don\u2019t just quit and turn to Netflix and your phone. Hit the gym, go out with your friends (or date), go to your library or if you\u2019re at home, put on your headphone and enjoy some music while doing work. Pick a book from your shelf. Spend time with your beloved family. \n\nMan. I missed video games so much. I wanna buy the latest games. I wanna buy the latest RTX laptops. I wanna go watch a esports match live near my location. I still talk about video games on Reddit. But I still never want to go back to it. I promise once I\u2019ve achieved my goal, THEN I\u2019ll consider going back to what I once loved. Someone told me that once I got older, I might be too tired physically and mentally to play video games. So be it. I rather have that than having to suffer from regret. \n\nEveryone in r/StopGaming i wish you all the best. You\u2019ve the courage to recognise your addiction and possess the audacity to make a change. And that deserves a huge commendation\n",

            "selftext": "About 3 years ago I was in a partial hospitalization program for depression and anxiety. After I got out I was in a very low point in my life, but I started frequenting osrs twitch streams and played the game again. I loved hanging out in streams and on discord, talking about runescape and making jokes with everyone all the time. I was unemployed at the time and had no friends, but I met a great amount of online friends and I still talk to most of them this day on a shared discord server.\n\nAt the start of the new year I got back into the game again on an ironman after quitting my main account, which was close to maxing. I wanted more of an 'achievement', and I hated the idea of playing multiple alts to be efficient for money.\n\nI'm 26 now and I feel like I'm wasting a lot of time. I just graduated college in December, but I still havent found a full time job. I do have a job at a library which gets me close to full time hours, but it doesn't pay well. I still live with my parents. I stopped going to the gym and running two years ago because of depression and possibly runescape. I lost all my muscle and cardio gains, and I'm out of shape.\n\nI really enjoy osrs though. I love skilling so much. I love getting lost in the repetition, giving me time to think, talk to my friends, watch a movie, etc. But I could be reading more books I keep thinking. I could be applying for more jobs. I could be doing anything.\n\nBut all of my online friends are still playing, and I don't want to lose them. I have no other friends. This helps me feel close to them. It doesn't help that many are younger than me and still in school. They probably have the time to play. I even fell for one of my friends and got rejected, and I'm only now starting to recover from that. I'm a mess I feel.\n\nI go to work and the rest of it is spent on osrs. I even have a twitter account that helps me interact with the entire community. Sometimes I wonder why I want to be a part of them though, because many are toxic or all they do is play runescape, and don't have a lot of real life skills. At the same time I have a fear of if I take some time away, people will start to talk badly about me or something.\n\nI'm going to therapy again at least. I have my second day next week. ",

If I wanted to I can force myself to go to the gym, to clean my room, to live a better lifestyle... but that doesn't seem to be the case, I'm struggling and I want help and I want to better myself. \n\nI'm addicted and it's gotten to the point where it's all I do. I work a typical 9-5, but after work I go home and play League of Legends from 5-12, taking breaks for eating but I play until I have to go to sleep. I struggle waking up to go to work, snooze until I absolutely have to wake up and even after sleeping for more than 7-8 hours, wake up feeling groggy. In the last year or two I've gained about 30-40 pounds, I've tried to quit but eventually go back to it.\n\nThis is my Introduction and my Day 1.",

            "selftext": "So, previously I was a casual addict gamer, playing for a few hours everyday. I played PC games such as Borderlands, Red Dead Redemption, Assassin Creed, Call of Duty, Skyrim, The Witcher and so on. After that, my friend invited me to play Dota 2, as I'm playing Dota 1 before so I'm able to understand the game a little bit better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings go on, initially there's just less than 100 hours of Dota, and the last time I checked it's 2000ish hours. I played it just to have fun with my friends, laughing, and stuff. But it gotten really toxic as I'm sacrificing my sleep, my stress, and my physical health, to some extent. I decided to stop playing everything after I realized that, deleting my steam, my games and everything. Well, sometimes when I'm tired I just watch Pro Highlights. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut there are the things that I realized worth ALOT MORE to do than gaming despite the same duration.\n\n* Health. Previously I've only done room calisthenics just to keep myself from getting stiff. Now I'm lifting weight/doing calisthenics in the park using rings etc and also I jog 2 times a week. I couldn't believe  just an hour of lifting weights or just 20 minutes of light jog really boosts me up physically and mentally. My body looks and feels healthier, and that routine takes LESS TIME than playing a single session of Dota or any game.\n* Sleep. I used to play until past midnight and woke up around 5 or 6 A.M. perhaps 3-4 hours is sufficent for some people, but I don't get quality sleep. Now I stopped my gaming session, I'm able to sleep earlier and woke up more refreshed. Another point to physical and mental health!\n* Hobbies. I just realized, since I was introduced to guitar around 10 years ago, I keep training it even though I spend my times more on gaming. Just now, just from small hobbies routine give me alot of benefits. I'm able to to compose a music as my side job and able to learn other instruments quicker because I can understand music better through years of learning. What video games brings me since I played it on \\~2004 ? Nothing, just dopamine in my brain\n* Social. Now that I'm not spending my day in front of any screen playing games, I'm able to do more social stuff. I'm not anxious to talk to other people or less awkward moment. Everything seems a lot of fun.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy point is, as an addict before, I get a lot better since I stopped playing games. There's a lot of other things that you can do to improve yourself, and your future self will thank you. I regret that I didn't start earlier, but it's not too late for me. So do you!  But yeah, stopped playing games don't make my english better. So I apologize for that!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCheers",

I focused everything on getting the next game. I quit my favorite sport. Stopped being social. I associated with crowds that had similar addictions and I became a shell of the young bright student. Fast forward to college and I still couldn't focus. My grades where garbage, I never finished what I started but at the end of the day I always blew up my console or PC. Escaping my problems for a while. I used it as an emotional crutch and as my only means of socialization. I am now 23 and engaged but my addiction is continuously holding me back. I cannot focus at work, I ignore my fianc\u00e9, and I barely leave the house. Today I sold my console. I uninstalled everything off my work computer and I felt great excitement and great sadness. For years I built relationships with fellow gamers with similar levels of addiction. I am now sitting here and I am excited to try all the things I used to love but its been years and I feel empty. My fianc\u00e9 is in full support but I need ideas to fill the time. My first goal is to get back in shape. I plan on hitting the gym hard to reclaim some energy. I need other ideas, if you have suggestions I would be greatly appreciative. Thank you!",

            "selftext": "(I apologize for my English, not a native speaker) this is more a rant than anything else. TL:DR at the end.\n\nSo I came to a breaking point today because I realized I lost a hole day of study because of gaming, I have a really important exam in 3 days and depending on the approval of that exam I might get a job, which is great because I\u2019m just a college student currently and I would like to get that job. \n\nToday I woke up and I really wanted to game, so I thought -\u201cI will play a few rounds and then I\u2019m gonna study\u201d-  WELL those few rounds turned into 6 hours of grinding and I felt like shit, I couldn\u2019t stop, everytime a round ended I just pressed play again and I knew I should\u2019ve stop but I didn\u2019t. I literally started having a mental breakdown while I was playing of how I\u2019m just an asshole for ruining my future because of a game and I couldn\u2019t take it anymore, I press alt+f4, turned my computer off and started to unplug my pc parts and save them. \n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about doing this for a few weeks but I just kept pushing it putting myself excuses to do it later. But today I just exploded, I realized that I have no control when it comes to gaming and that the time to start was NOW. \n\nI feel relief right now, that I don\u2019t have my pc in my sight so I wont be tempted when I have to study. I hope this feeling last and that I can stop gaming for a few months, because honestly gaming just takes so much time of my life and I\u2019m in an age (22) where I should worry about my future and be independent, and games wont get me there. \n\nSo now THIS IS MY CHOICE, I CHOOSE TO GET MY LIFE TOGETHER AND DONT LET GAMING CONTROL ME!\n\nI would love to hear some advice for when the abstinence gets real and the need to relapse gets me. Thanks for reading! \n\nTL:DR: I had a mental breakdown while gaming that made me realize how wrong I was about my life choices and decided to save my PC. \n",

            "selftext": "About 3 years ago I was in a partial hospitalization program for depression and anxiety. After I got out I was in a very low point in my life, but I started frequenting osrs twitch streams and played the game again. I loved hanging out in streams and on discord, talking about runescape and making jokes with everyone all the time. I was unemployed at the time and had no friends, but I met a great amount of online friends and I still talk to most of them this day on a shared discord server.\n\nAt the start of the new year I got back into the game again on an ironman after quitting my main account, which was close to maxing. I wanted more of an 'achievement', and I hated the idea of playing multiple alts to be efficient for money.\n\nI'm 26 now and I feel like I'm wasting a lot of time. I just graduated college in December, but I still havent found a full time job. I do have a job at a library which gets me close to full time hours, but it doesn't pay well. I still live with my parents. I stopped going to the gym and running two years ago because of depression and possibly runescape. I lost all my muscle and cardio gains, and I'm out of shape.\n\nI really enjoy osrs though. I love skilling so much. I love getting lost in the repetition, giving me time to think, talk to my friends, watch a movie, etc. But I could be reading more books I keep thinking. I could be applying for more jobs. I could be doing anything.\n\nBut all of my online friends are still playing, and I don't want to lose them. I have no other friends. This helps me feel close to them. It doesn't help that many are younger than me and still in school. They probably have the time to play. I even fell for one of my friends and got rejected, and I'm only now starting to recover from that. I'm a mess I feel.\n\nI go to work and the rest of it is spent on osrs. I even have a twitter account that helps me interact with the entire community. Sometimes I wonder why I want to be a part of them though, because many are toxic or all they do is play runescape, and don't have a lot of real life skills. At the same time I have a fear of if I take some time away, people will start to talk badly about me or something.\n\nI'm going to therapy again at least. I have my second day next week. ",

I'm not here to get rid of my stuff, rather I'd like to ask how to best get rid of it - and then I'll do that part elsewhere.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's this MMO I spent 4 years playing only to realize one day, all the people I knew who played it are gone or changed. Everyone in game is a total jerk, so why would I want to  spend any time on it. And, that being in the game is a total waste of time. I recently moved to Hawaii and there are so many things I could be doing outside. And I have been! But there is more to do and see, and wasting time indoors on something like this is just.. ugh. So I want to quit, and I put all this time into this, and would like to get something out of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm just curious what the best method for receiving a payment would be these days. I've heard bad things about paypal. That someone can pretend to buy your account, and then after they get your password and raid your account, they get a refund via Paypal. And then you are left holding a robbed/vandalized account. And the 3rd party broker sites are no better. Literally the idea is that you are supposed to trust them and they act as a middleman. Except.. who the hell are these people and why should we trust them LOL? They're just some guy on the Internet, too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA long time ago I played EQ (yea yea another MMO, a friend kept getting me into these things), and ended up selling my account. I advertised on ebay and asked the guy for a cashiers' check because it can't be ripped off like some of the things today.  I might still lean that way but I'm open if there are better ways.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone have any recent account selling experiences and what did you learn? My primary question has to do with being able to unload my account, but not being ripped off. I'm looking for payment methods where someone can't rip me off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I've been thoroughly inspired by you guys, and also other aspects of life during the last few months. I was playing an mmorpg for up to 5 hours a day while trying to get my engineering degree, which was almost all the free time I had (I bought take away to be able to game more). This got way worse when I decided to drop out because I wasn't passing, rather than fixing my bad habits. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the last few months I've been sitting at my computer from the moment I wake up until I can barely keep my eyes open any more, only pausing for bathroom, showers, and food. My estimate is about 100 hours a week or 15 hours a day. My health decayed, my social skills and life has disappeared, and I've missed out on so many opportunities and blatantly ignored severe financial issues. This has happened earlier in my life as well but I managed to quit for a time, however I did not let anyone know about my problem, ever. This time I want to be completely open about it. 24 Hours in right now and I figured I would make this post as a start! Now to go use all this free time to set life back on the right track. Cheers!",

A game is tetris or minesweeper or solitaire... but something where you create an alter-ego, get achievements, continue your adventure, invest so much time and effort in... is NOT a \"game\". \n\nFantasies used to be something kids did up to a point, not something teenagers or adults did. Now it has become acceptable and normal to jump into fantasy for hours each day. Adults playing games, adults going to game conventions, adults doing game \"art\" and so on. It's like Peter Pan but worse.\n\nWe already know maladaptive daydreaming is a very real and dangerous condition and we already know how disconnected from reality and engulfed in their own world/fantasy people with certain psychiatrical conditions are (schizophrenia/mania/psychosis/dissociation etc), yet we brush off people spending hours each day completely immersed in fantasy because it's a \"game\"? It's not that different to fantasize about something or play a game - you're still suspending your disbelief and dissociate from reality. How is it THAT different that i fantasize I fight a dragon in my fantasy or that i fight a dragon in a game? To take this point forward, the game fantasy is actually MORE articulate and powerful than just a fantasy scenario because it's saved and it has progress.",

            "selftext": "I played video games very little in the past couple weeks. When I did finally play, my first couple games were good- I was also playing with a real-life friend who is currently on the other side of the world. \n\nToday was very successful so I decided to \"play a few games of CS:GO.\" \n\nThe first 2 games were good- no negativity, etc. We played well as a team so it was enjoyable. \n\nThe last game? Fuck man, this is my breaking point. We started out very strong, something like 8-0 in CS:GO and I was playing exceptionally well. The team was quiet and seemingly positive. I was 3/5 on our team, so average (but net positive). The bottom 2 teammates were horrible. \n\nWe started playing a bit worse, I don't know why. I decided at one point not to peak a corner, so another guy got shot. Suddenly everyone blew up at me- I think the 4 people are together. \n\nThey started cussing at me, typing negative stuff, and then teamkilled me the next round. The round after I got team-shot to 30/100 HP, and so died near instantly. \n\nNormally I would brush it off but I blew up. I was having such a good day, and these [insert every profanity here] were just being [more profanities]. I started typing some REALLY messed up stuff and got VERY angry. I couldn't focus on the game anymore. \n\nIt made no sense why they were all so mean- I was performing significantly better than the bottom 2 teammates, yet they all decided to pick on me.\n\nAgain, I understand some toxicity is \"normal\" online, but these people were beyond toxic. I was infuriated to the point of typing profanities until they kicked me. After, I wished some things upon them that probably no one deserves to have in life. \n\nSo, obviously I'm going through some things right now (namely, a break up), to make me a bit more reactive to little things, but this was a HUGE wake up call. \n\nVideo games are absurdly toxic. People actively try to make your day worse. You could be #1 on the team and game and people will target you for it, or you could be the worst player and people will target you for that, too. \n\nIt's nothing but everyone's shadow self, and when you hang around other people's shadow selves, your shadow self starts to come out. \n\nThe best part of my few hours of video games today wasn't even the games- it was in between games when I browsed products on Amazon that I will need for a real life adventure I'm about to have! \n\n**The video games capture my focus, but they don't bring fulfillment, whereas those things which don't suck me in are often what bring me fulfillment (and I'm guessing the same is for you, too).** \n\nRecently I've done a lot of life reflecting and video games are probably my #1 vice (I'd put them in the same category as porn + Reddit, too). They started out as coping after the break up with my ex, but it spiraled out of control. Some weeks were better than others, and those are the weeks filled with memories and fulfillment... and most importantly, life progress. \n\nI'm not an angry person. You meet me and you'd be shocked to hear that someone like me would've wrote what I did, but something just \"ticked\" today. \n\nVideo games are a time bomb- a certain % of the games are exceptional, but many are bad. You don't quite know what you're getting, so you're stuck on this emotional roller coaster. \n\nAnd again, it's a place where people actively bring out their dark, \"shadow selves.\" They are not there to play cooperatively. They are there to bring you down. In the process of doing so, you will become dark yourself. \n\nPlease, if you're reading this, quit with me. Today I bought a one-way ticket to the other side of the world to finally have the adventure I had always wanted to have. I kept procrastinating for months now because of the pain of my ex (of which the break up was not video games-related), when really it was going to hurt either way, I'd just have to DO IT at some point. \n\nSo I'm quitting. I leave in 23 days to my dream destination, and damnit I want my brain to be fully functional when I arrive. I'm so tired of this cycle, this endless derp state perpetuated by mindless internet &amp; video games. \n\nHere's to reality... a bit scary, yes, but I hope so much more worth it. I'm posting this because I can't go back. ",

            "selftext": "**This post is just to share my struggles and nothing more. It's not being posted to have anyone feel bad over me. Be warned it's not proofread and I never learned much grammar. But it's probably different than most stories here.**\n\n**Also TO THE MODS your \"inspiring stories from the comunity link is broken and links to a page saying \"nothing found.\" A bit funny but it's borked.**\n\nMost people on this Reddit seemed addicted because they are having fun. That's not the case here.\n\nObsessive compulsive disorder can come in many different forms and mine is no different.\n\nWhen I was younger I played a lot of video games and before highschool I was able to work and have fun with things other than video games. Then all of the sudden a switch was pulled and ocd went into overdrive. (For those of you who don't know ocd generally gets worse as kids mature into adults.)\n\nI couldn't understand why but I was literally unable to stop playing video games no matter how hard I tried.\n\nImagine anything you like doing and then imagine your mind is constantly telling you no you can't do this activity because because something bad will happen. If you were to try doing this activity it would be a massive storm of anxiety that you couldn't handle. Then imagine it being constantly in the back of your head about how much you want to do something and how bad you feel not doing it but every time you actually get any courage to try it ocd tells you \"No you can't or else \"\" bad thing will happen.\"\n\nThat's essentially what happened with me. Everything I enjoyed doing I was no longer able to do because insert bad thing that is happening or will happen if you do it.\n\nThen imagine you are forced to constantly walk through rooms a certain way or touch things a certain way repeatedly for a specific number of times and if you don't do it exactly right you have to start over. It can get so bad that people may not even want to move around the house at all.\n\nI tried my hardest to stop it. At the time I had no idea what was wrong with me and the counselor couldn't help me much. Well I managed to stop doing these actions through some really really horrible times and attempts for it just to go to my head mentally.\n\nNow it was in my head, vile thoughts would play through my head that I would have to correct. No matter how many times I corrected it it was almost never enough. This is a pretty innocent example but explains what I mean. You think \"Die mom\" and would have to think \"I don't want you to die mom god please don't kill her I didn't mean it\" 14 times and if you mess up once have to restart.\n\nNow imagine that constantly happening all day every day for years on end.\n\n**Video games**\n\nThis is where video games come into play. They offered a temporary relief (but not entirely.) I had something else to focus and it helped somewhat.\n\nOcd was still present in the games but somehow it was bearable. For example I had to do things in a certain way or it would just set my ocd off.\n\n**It's extremely hard to imagine, write, do art and have fun with this type of problem.**\n\n**why I'm still addicted.**\n\nIn recent years (maybe less than two?) I've gotten help and medicine. Started meeting a counselor for a short while and he gave me some help on how to deal with this mind sickness. Eventually I went to a psychiatrist and started taking medicine for it as well.\n\nIn short it's a life long problem, medicine only lengthens the time between ocd attacks and this is a life long condition.\n\nThis took me a while to figure out, even undetected after counseling was over. You can have Ocd to obsessively avoid something.\n\nEven if i'm away from a saved game for a few days or any project I'll feel as if something bad happened because I was away for a few day's and can't continue it. Forgot where I was and everything will turn out horrible because of the time spent away even though this isn't true.\n\nThis explains so much. After the original spike of ocd right before high school I stopped anything I enjoyed due to the listed reason above. Video games are essentially effortless to throw own and do nothing in and they distract me from ocd.\n\n**Treating Ocd**\n\nThis post has gone on for to long but long story short most people probably need professional help and medicine. These obsessive thoughts never go away but you can't listen to them. Sometimes it's not possible to do this without medicine and even then it can be a struggle.",

I am a student just came back from spring break. I came back to a lot of problems in my life that I avoided. My best way to avoid these problems was video games. I'd play video games at least 3 to 4 hours a day and while that doesn't seem like a lot. I noticed that it hinders a lot of aspects in my life from relationshipsand friendships to academics and career. Today is my first day trying not to sit down in my chair anf flip on th Xbox, and I gotta admit it's really difficult to the point that it's unsettling. Right after my mind started droning on all the problems that need to be solved in my life, I needed some kind of gratification; gratification that I usually get by winning some 9 minute match in a game. I guess I'm trying to say that doing this is going to be harder than I thought, and I'm really lucky I found this sub when I did. \n\nTldr;  This is difficult to do but I guess that means I need to unplug.

I've ranged through all sorts of games, rarely quitting. Things are getting bad with league of legends and I want to give it up for good. \n\nI'm going to pick boxing back up again, studying for a state exam, reading, running, and weight lifting. It's going to be difficult to keep my days busy for now, my career is in a transition phase but things should get busy at an undetermined date.\n\nFeel free to comment or startup of conversation. ",

            "selftext": "I can't stand how toxic and angry gamers are anymore, I just want friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy reason for deciding to give up games is not because I'm addicted to it. I can stop myself from playing at the drop of a hat and I don't have any issues getting work done. The problem is that I don't know how to make friends any other way. I met all of my best friends through gaming and inevitably lost them because of the very thing that brought us together. Their rage and their addiction to gaming got in the way. It's a vicious cycle, but lately I haven't even had the chance to start the cycle. I can't make friends anymore, period. It's like friendly, sociable gamers stopped existing. *Everyone is so damn mean.* Unfortunately, I don't have any other hobbies that can do what games do and I can't seem to make friends in real life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I like to draw, but drawing isn't very exciting to do with friends and most people in the art community are more interested in treating it like work than entertainment. It can't compare to gaming. I also like to roleplay, but it's prone to a lot of the same toxicity and I find myself wanting so much more than words on a screen. The same trend is seen in just about all of my hobbies. Focusing on other hobbies makes me feel lonely. Focusing on college makes me feel lonely. Thinking about my future makes me feel hopeless. I don't know what I'm working so hard for. A house? Stability? The ability to travel and afford nice things? What for? I have no one to share those things with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thing is, I could see myself enjoying almost anything if I could do it with a really good friend. I find myself wishing someone would just pick me up and say \"we're friends now and we're going to run away to do x, y, and z!\" and it could be anything, anything at all. Instead, I'm stuck with no social skills and no real drive or passion for my major and no friends. I want to move on with my life, but right now it seems easier to end it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess I spent too much of my life worrying about the wrong things. I grew up thinking I didn't need people and pushed them away over and over and over again. I didn't want to hang out with anyone or date anyone. People would ask but I always turned them down, I thought games and academics were enough. I thought that even if I lost my game buddies I'd be okay...",

            "selftext": "Looking back at games, the vast majority offer such a surreal experience of power and domination. No matter how low you are in life.. no job, no house, no family, no future... just log into games and you feel like the alpha dog. Everything revolves around you -  you save the day, you command armies, you kill people, you control production, you have the top items and most cash.... and if you don't? Just play some more and you'll get it.\n\nRanks, achievements, uniques, epics, mythics, combos, bosses (you will inevitably defeat). Games give you so, so much.\n\nShooter games or fighting games... you get to feel like the top dog. I guess in a normal playthrough of any shooter game you get to KILL at least 1000 people. Can you even imagine the rush that you get? I was watching a playthrough of GTA3 the other night and I remember how I used to feel back then. A whole city at your feet. A whole city. You get to kill, steal anyone. You get to do whatever you want and you're even above the authorities and the military. Can you even imagine what that does to our ego? Limitless power.\n\nEven in a dumb Fortnite game you get to kill at least 5 people or so every game. Repeat that multiple times per day and you end up killing over a hundred people. You dominated 100 people. Yet the promise of the game is even more alluring. You can get be #1 if only you try harder. Can you even imagine what powerrush that is?\n\nThen there's strategy games.. you get to control armies and cities. You get to tell thousands of people what to do and they just do it. You get to kill whoever you want and you usually end up killing thousands. \n\nEven in Farming Simulator which one would think is a game that can't possibly be about power... guess who controls everything? You. Who gets to own houses and land like a king? You. Who ends up having millions or billions of $$ in cash, inventory or assets? You.\n\nI could go on but i'd love to hear your opinions as well. What do you think about power and domination in games? ",

I think that's pretty reasonable, most kids don't enjoy a lot of the things they do.\n\nBut now I'm an adult and I'm still doing that. I'm going to college for something I enjoy (computer science; go figure) and no one forces me to do anything. But for some reason I have this mindset that anything I'm \"required\" to do is something I'll hate and must be avoided. Why do I wait so long to do the dishes? I'll have to get to them eventually. I really like having a clean sink. I don't hate doing them, it only takes a few minutes. But instead I'm putting it off so I can have more \"free time\" to play video games. Every time I do anything other than game, I'm just killing time until I can get back to my desktop. It's not that I actually hate doing things other than gaming, I've just conditioned myself to avoid everything else and I'm not sure why.",

It takes time away from the goals I have set for myself. I'm sick of it. I need to make some serious changes in my life. I have thrown so much of my time down in the shitter. I'm so frustrated and angry. Just needed to vent. I also need to come up with a plan on how I am going to stop this addiction. Any tips are welcome.",

I decided to change myself, I'm dealing with my porn and sweet drinks addictions, but the most time consuming thing in my life is playing video games, so I've decided to do something with it. I wanted to play just a good games with great story or local co-op games, but it didn't end up well. I always return to Rainbow Six: Siege or CS:GO or Apex again, because I'm just good at these games and in local co-op, I've played with my friend once like 6 months ago, and never again. The problem is, that I'm only good in gaming and I'm not any good in anything else. I tried drawing, but when I finished my drawing, I just stopped even trying how bad it was. Then I tried sports, but I wasn't accepted to any of sports clubs in the town. The only think, I do, when I'm not playing games or studying is a really slight exercises at home. My body changed a little bit, so I'm happy for that and I continue with it, but I can't go to gym, because of my mind. How deal you with this problem? ",

It was the rock bottom for me and my game addiction. Ironically or not, it was called Don't Starve. I was playing Don't Starve while literally starving myself in real life.\n\nBut as fate would have it, i watched the ending again on youtube and came across the quote in the title.  *Even a king is bound to the board.*\n\nWhy do we do it? Why did I do it?\n\nWhy did I care so much to be good at a video game? Why did I care so much when others were better than me in video games?\n\nI mean, it's a video game. It's not real. Why tf did i care so much? Why waste so much time and effort to be good/competitive in a game? That's like the dumbest thing possible, yet i was consumed by being the best in video games, whether it's single or multiplayer.\n\nAnd so that quote in the title keeps ricocheting in my head... \"Even a king is bound to the board, Even a king is bound to the board\"\n\nWhy do we accept this? Why do we accept THE BOARD? It's an entirely artificial construct made by other people with no meaning or purpose for our lives. Why use our energy in it? Why do we accept the premise that it matters what we do in games? Why do we accept them as real? Why do we accept that those worlds, those characters, those items or our actions are real and that they make a difference?\n\nSo that we can get to feel like kings? \n\nMost likely, but when we become kings and fight to remain kings, we also become bound to the board.",

            "selftext": "Im new to reddit but this reddit told me to introduce myself so here we go I Grew up Physical abused by classmates In school for 6 years I got In over 500 fights a year Only winning 5 physically In 6 years and had most of them end of with me running away safe or them running away and me laying on the floor bruised and battered, One time a kid pulled a knife on me, I never ran so fast in my life, During that time (Around 2011) I had gone from having a crappy laptop to a fullblown ps3 with skyrim for free (It was on craigslist) I begged my parents for so long, and since their very anti gun and endorsed my passion of history I told them it had no guns and it was like D&amp;D with axes and magic and dragons (Even though skyrim has wyverns not dragons) And because of the beatings I feel into a deep depression I was pretty young at the time so I didn't realise that I was suicidal, The bullying got so bad I wouldn't go to classes or homework I would just race home and play skyrim for up to 6 hours on school days and 24 hours after a full weekend (12 hours a day) It didn't fill the void the depression left but it help, a lot In 6 years I spent 20,000 hours on skyrim (Around 2.5 years of playtime) and then on december 12 2013 I attempted succeeded by trying to build up the guts to slit my wrists as you can tell I failed After this the only comfort was skyrim and then I moved, new school new area and the bullying stopped But the void was still there so I picked up tf2 and all I will say is that I must of spent over 2k On that game And only 2k hours (A dollar an hour for a \"free\" game, sounds about right) but on january 31st Of last year I quit tf2, But not gaming, Best decision I made so far Ever since I quit tf2 I wanted to quit it all first I quit for 3 days then 1 week and then 1 day and so on so fourth I had immence cravings and it was almost painful to let go I had so much physical pain in my stomach from all the stress thinking about never seeing Elder scrolls 6 or not being able to play Dishonoured and assassins creed black flag  I had about 30 games in my library (Notably assassin creed games, For honour, Skyrim, Fallout 4, portal 1 and 2, and far cry 4) In november I quit well I quit to a limit I weened myself off of it Only played a few days out of the month of december and was clean for january and febuary But this march I relapsed Without even knowing it, Like a zombie I just opened for honour and started doing dailys to get steel it is my 2 week break and I get extreamly depressed when I dont have anything meaningful to do Like work so I use video games to give my life false meaning but at least Its not just saddness, Im so used to such high paced entertainment on such instant demand Its so hard to find a replacment, Watching shows and movies are fast paced and instant but its even worse cause Im just sitting there not even lifting a finger, Books are amazing I have so many nerdy series I want to read but I'm a very slow reader so Its hard to keep focused so far Ive just gone to my backyard and praticed archery, Knifethrowing, Boxing and chopping wood or fun and its worked out but Once night rolls around and Im confined to my room I get huge cravings Sometimes there so heavy I cant sleep So Ive taken to making pathfinder (like D&amp;D) characters Ive made so many and My group dosnt play until june which is 3 months away and because of this I sit at night watching podcasts once again doing nothing with my life just sitting at a computer screen gaining nothing, because of this I don't think I'll ever find a hobby that can make me feel like Im gaining somthing (One that I can do all the time) working out seems to be my best bet because of the years of gaming and my own mental and physical disabilitys Working out has made my feel better both through my mental self image, my self esteem and how I look and feel Physicly, Im getting stronger its amazing because Im stronger in real life where I can feel and do new things Instead of being able to do amazing things when the computers on No matter what I can do things that I could never do before. Im hoping to be able to do 1 chin up by the 1st of june, and then I'll be on the road to doing whatever my dark brotherhood assassin could do and maybe even do it better, One day I wont have to play assassins creed or dishonoured or skyrim to be a agile climbing expert who can do all sorts of acrobatic trick becaue I will be that person I will be able to climb the tallest hosues and sneak by the most perceptive gaurds do summersults and backflits climb, vault and roll because then All those things I did will mean somthing and if when im playing dnd My dm says \"You couldn't Climb this it would be way to hard\" , Ill say \"Oh, its easy, Ill show you\" and then every thing ive done all the hours of gaming replaced with hours of training instead of those hours meaning nothing when I exit the game when I exit the gym Ill have actully gained somthing and changed myself for the better, I am atruecanadian\\_ and I will not let . the game decide who I am",

I also quit my Gamestop job and instantly found a much better paying one that I will start tomorrow. On top of that, I no longer keep in touch with hardly any gaming friends anymore because I no longer resonated with their lifestyles.\n\nI feel a bit sad, because I spent 6 months to 100% Breath of the Wild and deleted the data and sold my Nintendo Switch, for some reason, that was my only console I regretted selling because I feel like I barely tried it and I enjoyed it so much. Literally it is an attachment to the system itself, not any random Switch, although when I sold it, I had no regrets. I was never too addicted to video games aside from Zelda series that consumed my time and mind, but even that I took week breaks from with ease. I sold my games because I felt a gut feeling that I should and I really couldn't even enjoy games without feeling shameful and like a timewaster anymore, so I listened to that feeling with eagerness.\n\nI feel like I will be missing out on so many games. BOTW 2, Mario Odyssey 2, and I never even finished Smash Ultimate. I own a Wii U with no gamepad, a 3ds, neither of which have any save data left, a Gameboy Advance SP, a Gamecube, and an N64, (I cannot play those because I lack the proper TV). My Xbox One S and Playstation 4 were easy for me to get rid of, as I didn't play them much.\n\nI made a vow only to play video games after I becames successful in life.",

Landed myself into a decent career, and enjoying my life in general.\n\nWhile quitting the game has tremendously benefited me, I've been trying to play a bit with extreme caution. Recently, I've decided to quit all but one game, but the account for that game is tied with others from the same company. Unfortunately, partially disabling the account is not possible.\n\nAs an alternative, I'm looking for a managing app like a StayFocusd, but for Windows OS instead of web browser. What I need is an ability to ban specific apps to be run without a way to revoke the ban. If you know one, please let me know.\n\nI'll probably quit all of them if I can't find them, but it's such a nice game that I played for years without overcommitting myself.\n\n",

I\u2019m not extraordinary good at any of the games I play though.\nWhen it\u2019s weekend, I usually play for hours upon hours and forget to shower and do homework ultimately resulting in me getting worse grades than I should get. I think my video game addiction is really beginning to take over my childhood at this point. I can\u2019t stop. My father (and foremost my mother, but I moved my pc to my dads place) gets angry at me almost every evening when I\u2019m at his house, for not taking any responsibility when it comes limiting my gaming. For example (this happened yesterday): my dad went to sleep early and I told him before that I would go to bed at 9PM and wake up the next day at 7AM to do my homework. I, however, completely lost time and it was already 10:20PM and my dad stepped into the room yelling at me. I completely understand his reaction as this has happened many times before but I just can\u2019t seem to help it. \n\nAny help would be really appreciated.",

However I made it through school and am in my 6th semestre of University. I really enjoy my subjects, but\n\nTHERE IS NOTHING I ENJOY AS MUCH AS VIDEO GAMES\n\n^((except sex ofc))  \n\n\nThis is totally annoying as it means that whenever I want to do something that makes me happy, I turn to videogames.  \nThis has led to a bunch of exams I still have to write and to me being unsatisfied with myself in every aspect of my life.  \nI am a person with a grand goal in mind and I discovered what I like most in games are three things:\n\n1. Measurable Progress\n2. Getting this one skill and then being godly good\n3. Imagining to be this really cool character and having the necessary skillset (e.g. in Fallout 4, I always make a character with a super cool and frosty spy in mind and tend to sneak around a lot because of the coolness associated with a silent kill)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I decided to quit games, but I have a lot of trouble to get this **instant satisfaction** which I get from gaming.\n\nSo I've got two questions:\n\n1. Are there any hobbys that combine measurable growth, instant satisfaction and fun together? I am not talking about weeks of progress but minutes.\n2. What do you guys think about mobile games (mostly mobile ports of XCOM or GTA SA or KOTOR)? I like to thank of them as a way of countering quitting cold turkey...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you all for keeping alive this helpful sub! And well\n\nCheers to a new life, I guess",

            "selftext": "As a kid, I had multiple handhelds and consoles. I would go to school, get home and play video games. Then I found Halo at age around 12. As soon as I found out about Xbox live it was over. I would play several hours a day after getting off school and my friends would have LAN parties. Then I started playing competitively. Went to 2 different MLG events, played online tournaments. I started practicing 5-6 hours a day 5-6 days a week. By this time, the game was now at Halo 3 on the Xbox 360. I would hop on and next thing you would know 5-6 hours would pass by and it felt like an hour at most. One day my 360 got the E74 error and I didn't have the money to replace it, so I stopped playing video games. I was 17 at the time and I realized I wasted years of my life playing video games.\n\nI would occasionally get the urge to play video games. My friend left his PS3 at my house a few years ago and whenever I would play COD, I would HAVE to keep grinding and keep going. My friend came and got his PS3 and I quit again\n\nI found out about speed running so that pulled me back into the video game world. I wouldn't play video games, but I would watch youtube videos on gaming stuff for whatever reason. About two weeks ago, I randomly thought about my runescape account from like 12 years ago and checked to see if I could still log in and it worked. I then started playing runescape 4-5 hours a night for the past 2 weeks and I just realized I let myself get sucked back in. Now my sleep schedule is all fucked up, and my mental health has been poor. \n\nOnce you quit, dont pick it back up. Every time I would try to play in moderation, I would very easily and in not much time, get sucked back into it. You are just tricking your brain into thinking you are accomplishing something. I probably spent at least a year of real time playing video games throughout my life. Imagine if I would have done something else with my time. A years worth minutes in a particular subject could have me a college degree or time in gym working out. ",

Sure you're right, video games are good, I love playing them, a lot of us do, but that is exactly the problem. We, the addicts, can't help ourselves. Many like myself have had our lives ruined by games. When we talk ill of games, that comes from our personal experience. Our words are a reflection of how we see gaming. You can't tell us how we feel, don't try to.\n\nI need to hate games. I NEED to. I've struggled for years; I want to kill myself. I can't stand being who I am, and the only thing keeping me alive is rejecting video games in all forms. Someone commented that they are like me, but they watch videos of people playing games and enjoy the story that way. There are definitely ways to find a balance like that. Not everyone in this sub is like me, I get that. I think it's totally out of place for someone to come on this sub and talk down to people who are struggling and suffering. Imo mods should remove that original post.\n\nThis sub has been a good place for me to read about other people struggling and to find comfort knowing I'm not alone. I come here and offer my own stories and advice and it helps me want to keep trying to be better. If we need to let out our anger and frustration, this is our place to do it. If you don't like it, go to a different community, don't try to talk down to us like you know better. This is r/StopGaming because we can't handle ourselves and our lives have been ruined. \n\nSome people here do just moderate rather than fully quit and that's fine. I'd rather encourage people to do whatever they need to stay healthy and happy than see posts making other people feel like idiots for feeling bad about their own lives. Some of us don't like games. That's what happens when they ruin your life. I'm sure most of us understand that isn't true for most people, but it is never anyone's place to tell someone how they feel. Our emotions and opinions are our own and for good reason. We are here to accept and support each other, NOT to criticize each other.\n\nI hope you think about how insensitive you have been and never do something like this again. ",

This is fcking annoying and it's brother me so much. \n\nI been playing video games ever since i was 5 and now im 18 and i feel like a old man with gray hair.

Gaming is an interactive medium, an art form. Just like ANY form of art, there are masterpieces and there are the run of the mill made-to-keep-you-playing games that only serve to generate money from its customers \nand waste your time. \n\nThe idea that only gaming is a waste of time among the sea of entertainment we are surrounded by is just silly. Are movies a waste of time? Are TV shows? Music? Books? Chess? \n\nThe answer is yes and no depending on what you chose to consume!\n\nThink of how many other forms of art are purely created to suck in the experiencer and not to provide anything of value or tell a beautiful story that can provide us with a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world around us. \n\nThere ARE games that provide this experience, and they differ from person to person. The problem is not with GAMING, but with YOU and your reliance on an interactive experience that is not providing you with any wealth. Gaming itself is NOT a waste of time, nor is it a useless and predatory medium in general. It\u2019s the same as any other form of art, and how wisely YOU choose what YOU consume and how YOU choose to enjoy it are the most important factors.\n\nFind a symbiotic relationship with gaming, not a parasitic one. \n\n",

I am trying to rebuild myself now, and with the help of my family got clean one year ago. I relapsed pretty hard during the winter (seasonal depression is a bitch). I got clean again in January and have made it to this point. However, Sekiro (the new From Soft game) comes out today, and I REALLY want to play it. I have beaten all the souls games, and love them more than any series. The games are art to me really, and I love them. But my fear of relapse has forced me to swear off games for a substantial amount of time. I'm trying to stay strong and thought posting here might help me get this off my chest and out of my system.

After I got out I was in a very low point in my life, but I started frequenting osrs twitch streams and played the game again. I loved hanging out in streams and on discord, talking about runescape and making jokes with everyone all the time. I was unemployed at the time and had no friends, but I met a great amount of online friends and I still talk to most of them this day on a shared discord server.\n\nAt the start of the new year I got back into the game again on an ironman after quitting my main account, which was close to maxing. I wanted more of an 'achievement', and I hated the idea of playing multiple alts to be efficient for money.\n\nI'm 26 now and I feel like I'm wasting a lot of time. I just graduated college in December, but I still havent found a full time job. I do have a job at a library which gets me close to full time hours, but it doesn't pay well. I still live with my parents. I stopped going to the gym and running two years ago because of depression and possibly runescape. I lost all my muscle and cardio gains, and I'm out of shape.\n\nI really enjoy osrs though. I love skilling so much. I love getting lost in the repetition, giving me time to think, talk to my friends, watch a movie, etc. But I could be reading more books I keep thinking. I could be applying for more jobs. I could be doing anything.\n\nBut all of my online friends are still playing, and I don't want to lose them. I have no other friends. This helps me feel close to them. It doesn't help that many are younger than me and still in school. They probably have the time to play. I even fell for one of my friends and got rejected, and I'm only now starting to recover from that. I'm a mess I feel.\n\nI go to work and the rest of it is spent on osrs.",

I'm worried that I will get bored and go back to it.\n\nI began thinking about my life and realizing how much potential and time I've wasted on nothing. And I know that if I raise my child in a home where games are important, he will follow in the same footsteps.
