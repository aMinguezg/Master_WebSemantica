            "selftext": "I have been open about my alcohol addiction for a long time. I have been trying so hard to remain sober for the past 3 years. Until my most recent relapse, I had no idea that sex/love (attention/validation) is what has been keeping me coming back to alcohol and thus, preventing me from fully recovering. \n\nI really want to get specific treatment for these issues but, the idea of SA meetings terrify me. I am already having thoughts/fantasies of hooking up with other fellow sex addicts which is so incredibly fucked up. \n\nI don't know what to do. Anybody here have co-occuring addictions that you failed to address until a lot of messing up? How did things change for you once you recognized/sought help for the more sneaky, underlying problem???",

She used to be close to me but recently I have distanced myself as the chaos and drama that comes with being her friend felt a bit overwhelming. She also recently started dating one of my best friends who I spend a lot of time with. He is not an addict and has never really been exposed to anything like this before. The relationship initially started off well, however more recently things have really started to unravel with big arguments. This is likely due to a huge escalation of my friends substance misuse and the chaotic behaviours that come with it. He has taken on the role of the rescuer and is desperately trying to save her whilst causing himself huge emotional turmoil. Basically, I have started to feel resentful, frustrated and angry at my friend suffering with addiction. I can see how much she is hurting the people around her and it\u2019s almost as if she doesn\u2019t care, which I know isn\u2019t really the case but she rarely (if ever) acknowledges the pain she has caused. I really don\u2019t want to feel this way and I want to feel empathy towards her. I know that she is suffering, I know life is sooo hard for her but I can\u2019t seem to find my empathy right now. Any help/advice would be so welcome. Thank you!",

Because of this, I used to be very careful when I drank because alcohol poisoning meant I would have to go to the hospital and get my stomach pumped).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy family has a long history of addictive personalities, on both sides.  Recently (4 months ago) I got so drunk that my partner considered taking me to the hospital.  I don't remember the Lyft ride home, or fading in and out of consciousness in our apartment, and I'm fully aware I got VERY lucky nothing bad happened.  Since then, I have not had any alcohol, full stop.  I was thinking today how I was ashamed I let it get to the point that it did, but that I was proud of myself for not going back to my old drinking habits in the last 4 months, and that I wanted to work on staying sober.  Then I heard a little voice in the back of my head \"Well, you smoke weed don't you?  You wouldn't REALLY be sober, and its insulting to those who ACTUALLY are to call yourself that.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm really good at tricking myself, and I'm just hoping for some feedback because I have two sides of my brain arguing different points and I just don't know which is right.",

I\u2019ve gotten over that a bit, but with summer coming I want to start staying at my moms house but it\u2019s been very hard. I have a harder time with memories at my moms house even though they aren\u2019t as serious as they were at my dads. I\u2019m staying there tonight and I\u2019ve just had an odd feeling, not that I\u2019m going to relapse, but I\u2019ve had some really fucked up memories in there. It may be hard being there aswell because my mom is very depressed from finding a suicide note I wrote 3 years ago. I\u2019m definitely going to stay there tonight but I was wondering if anyone has advice on staying in places you used and maybe let me know if I can text you. Thanks",

            "selftext": "So... i\u2019m new to this site. I recently confided in my boyfriend of 1.5 years that I\u2019ve been struggling with addition for the past few years. Let me give you some back story...\n\nI started smoking weed in college, every day. Once I moved back home after college, I was living with my parents and brother (who is a recovering addict) so I couldn\u2019t smoke weed. I started drinking every night instead. \n\nFor the past 5-6 years, I have been either high or drunk almost every night besides a couple dozen or so nights scattered around. I never drank or smoked at work, could hold down a job, and no one knew how much I was drinking. I got very good at hiding it. Buying wine and hiding it in my room, filling water bottles with liquor sometimes and hiding in my room. I would drink alone and no one could really tell I was drunk. \n\nSince I started dating my boyfriend 1.5 years ago, I started smoking more since I had moved out of my parents house. It\u2019s much easier to smoke every night and have people in your life have NO idea how much you\u2019re smoking, and not worry that it could be a problem. \n\nAnyway, it\u2019s been an internal struggle every day deciding drink/smoke or not to drink/smoke... and getting messed up always wins. It fucked my self esteem and just made me feel so bad about myself. I\u2019d feel hungover the next day and by the time the hangover subsided, I\u2019d be drinking again as soon as 5:30pm rolled around. \n\nI couldn\u2019t handle it anymore and decided to tell my boyfriend in order to have some outside accountability. It\u2019s been 2.5 weeks since I\u2019ve been sober. \n\nI also told my two best friends. \n\nIt didn\u2019t seem like anyone really believed me... my boyfriend told me last night that he missed drinking with me and that he was kind of looking forward to me drinking again.... I told him I don\u2019t think I could ever trust myself drinking again and he just seemed confused and surprised. I really don\u2019t think he understands the extent to which it had gotten? My friends didn\u2019t really seem to believe me either, but were very supportive and accepting of it. \n\nIt makes sense, I guess, since I had been hiding it very well. But it also makes me feel like maybe it was never really a problem at all and that I just amplified it in my head?\n\nAm I crazy or do I really have an addiction?",

            "selftext": "I shared this yesterday in /AlAnon. I'm sharing it here because I know lots of parents (including me) peruse this site to learn about addiction and to know how to deal with their son, daughter or another close family member.  \n\nI'm not trying to offend or judge anyone fighting addiction. Addiction is awful for the addict and the family. We're all trying to get through it.  I'm sharing our experience. That may not work for anyone else. My goal is to help family members avoid the mistakes we made. \n\n*Here's what I posted yesterday:*\n\nMy son is a recovering heroin addict. On May 27, he was one-year sober. His addiction lasted almost 12 years before he got clean.\n\nDuring those years, he was in and out of county jails and served 33 months in the state penitentiary. As anyone here knows, the journey for family members can be brutal. Ours certainly was. Like many of you here, my wife and I wish we knew when we discovered his addiction what we know now.\n\nI've thought a lot about that and whittled the lessons we've learned to a list of 10. The list could be much, much longer. I put it together in the following article:\n\n[10 Things You Need to Know if You\u2019re the Parent of an Addict](https://moneywithapurpose.com/if-youre-the-parent-of-an-addict/)\n\nWe attended Al-Anon along the way and found them very helpful. At the top of the list are the 3 C's of Al-Anon. It took us a long time to get these into our heads and implement. Fortunately, in time, we did.\n\nI hope these things help parents and family members avoid the many mistakes we made along the way.",

            "selftext": "First time poster here so I apologise in advance for any formatting errors. I'll try to keep a long story short.\n\nAbout 10 years ago my doctor started handing out co-codamol out like sweeties to me to deal with a birth defect in my shoulder that was causing me a lot of pain. The longer I was on them the more I took. Eventually I moved across the country and my new doctor cut me off, quite rightly. \n\nNo problem, I just started pharmacy hopping to get them over the counter in the form of Solpadeine Max. I was taking 4 tablets 4 times a day. They kept the pain away and kept me nice and numb/slightly buzzed and helped me keep able to do my job with ease.\n\nA few weeks ago I decided enough was enough, I was sick of spending hours on busses pharmacy hopping, making sure I had enough to last me, worrying about running out etc. Plus I booked my dream holiday that I've been saving up for years for and as it turns out it's illegal to take co-codamol into the country.\n\nI started tapering one week at a time. I've managed to get down to 1 Solpadeine Plus (half the strength I think) 4 times a day. I already feel like crap. I'm constantly exhausted, I can't focus on anything, I can't even enjoy my hobbies during my precious time off. Everything aches, my nose won't stop running and I'm running to the toilet constantly \n\nI don't even know why I'm putting this here, maybe because nobody knows and I just need to rant, but if anyone has any tips I'd love to hear. Either way thanks for reading and good luck to everyone who needs it",

[source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507260/]\n\nThe reason it does this is it helps the reward system achieve homeostasis, and calms the central nervous system. It's true that there are many minerals one should try and intake into the diet, but magnesium is particularly relevant in the realm of addiction because of it's particular functions in the brain. \n\nI personally am going to get a supplement and make sure I take it in the morning and night from now on.

It's really fucked up because my niece is an orphan whose mom was murdered and dad committed suicide. This started after the death of my sister and I get that it is a way of coping, but it seriously has affected my relationship with her and her being the primary caregiver of my niece, I don't want it to affect her (although it obviously already has, she has been self-harming at the age of 9).

No matter which drug are you taking there's no excuse when it comes to invite people to do the same. \n\nEven if it's weed, if the individual in matter has never get high before and has shown no interest then we must show respect to them, and by respect it means to avoid any intentional encourage for trying drugs at all. In fact, it should've been quite the opposite - encouraging sobriety - to anybody who has yet not taken a decision. \n\nIt's tremendously way common to skip weed into this topic. Most people knows the dangers of hard drugs such as heroin, meth or crack, then are less likely to try them, but what about pot?\n\nDon't get me wrong. Weed is a wonderful plant that is getting legalized, but does it mean we should be promoting its use for non-users? \n\nI think we should not. We should not promote its use to non-users because we will never know how it is going to affect their future. There's people who after pot they move on, and there's other who after pot makes it a habit, and also there's others who after pot then do harder drugs and destroy their life... \n\nHow could you tell the path a person is gonna take? There isn't. By introducing someone to weed you may be doing this person's a favor but you could also may be affecting his future in a wrong way. You could be the reason of his failure. I have known many people who would have devote their lives better if they wouldn't had smoked pot in the first place. \n\nSo AGAIN we should NEVER introduce nobody to drugs if they are not asking FOR.

We talked for a while then encouraged to use my money to buy heroin and so we did. Thing's went well except that I used his syringe to shoot me up. Now I'm worried about my health right now because chances are he's HIV+. Most junkies don't mind sharing their needles among themselves on their daily, showing the likely that it is for them to contract a disease in the run, since it does only take one single HIV+ user's shot into his bloodstream of a rolled up needle going around to spread the virus to whoever that used the same needle. In the absence of free access to clean needles for each person, they must have to keep re-using and sharing needles... Far away from home and in the inside's of an old and uninhabited suburb. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm now concerned about contracting a disease and the worse of all it ain't my first time. Last year, I tested for HIV three times after having had anal sex with a cheap ass prostitute without condom.",

            "selftext": "I won\u2019t shoot it though, I\u2019d rather keep the risk of death slightly lower \n\nI don\u2019t even know how upset I am over the breakup, because she told me she\u2019s breaking up with me, then when I left I got in my car and went straight to the city without thinking much \n\nI\u2019m well aware I used her dumping me as an excuse to go use. 100% no doubt I was fully aware of what I was doing, but I turned the radio up loud to avoid hearing my thoughts and thinking myself out of it, because I didn\u2019t want to. I haven\u2019t used heroin in like 2 years, but still, up to today I have felt like I\u2019m still the same I was then. Guess I\u2019m proving myself right lol. I can\u2019t shake the idea that I am just a junkie on the inside and on the outside I just act like I\u2019m fine and that my addiction was just a negative part of my past that I\u2019m over\n\nI haven\u2019t used dope in 2 years.. but today.... without hesitation... ugh\n\nEveryone always uses breakups as an excuse to go get high so I did too. That\u2019s it. I know it\u2019s wrong and not gonna help, it\u2019s just gonna make it worse and I know and I don\u2019t seem to care. I wanna be normal but I don\u2019t know how, I figured time heals all but the voice in my head never went away. Sure it got easier to say no over time, but it was always there. Everyday \n\nIn the past few months I\u2019ve taken some 30mg oxys on maybe 4-5 occasions, so I\u2019ve been on a slippery slope. When I met her I told myself I\u2019m done doing that though, I have, no, had, her making me happy so I don\u2019t need it anyways, right? Before those oxys I was doing well, drug wise, had a lot of time between me and opiates (minus my sub I take everyday.) But I still felt the same as always. I figured occasional oxys were fine because you can\u2019t really die from them as long as they aren\u2019t fake, and they\u2019re so expensive that it cost $90 to get buzzed and I can\u2019t afford to do that more than every few months, so it\u2019s like a natural deterrent. Plus I\u2019m on subs so I have a decent tolerance to opiates so that helps me convince myself I\u2019m not gonna die as long as I do 1 bag at a time\n\nI am so sad, I feel so bad for my loved ones. Imagine if they knew what i did today, and what I\u2019m doing right now, and will do tomorrow, too, until the bundles gone. I don\u2019t plan on buying another one, let\u2019s see if I can just keep this little treat to just that, a little treat..\n\nI truly believe I will be able to not buy more, I\u2019ve been doing well with these random occasions where I use opiates and then don\u2019t buy more. I don\u2019t wanna be addicted to them again but I cannot find pleasure or relief of any kind anywhere else no matter what I try to do, so the last few months I\u2019ve been randomly treating myself like this. But I\u2019m just torturing myself and I\u2019m well aware. She made me happy though \n\nI don\u2019t even know if this post is allowed, I\u2019m sorry if I ruin anyone\u2019s day with it, I just feel so empty. I hate drugs, I hate who I am right now, there\u2019s no one in the real world I can tell this to without potential repercussions so that\u2019s why I\u2019m telling you \n\n\nI don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m feeling, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m happy sad angry upset or what. I\u2019m just sitting here kind of high. It\u2019s not even that enjoyable \n\nI am weak, and I need to find some strength, I think it really is that simple at this point \n\nJust to say, this girl was just too good to be true and I knew it the whole time. I\u2019ve been waiting for something to happen because it\u2019s just been too good. She accepted the fact I used to be an addict and was okay as long as I didn\u2019t start using again. That\u2019s fair. It was a pretty casual relationship, low maintenance cause we were both busy so when we would chill it was always laid back, and we both told each other that we\u2019re happy it\u2019s this way. We just hung out and went out to eat and enjoyed each other\u2019s company and would lay together and watch tv and kiss and shit all night. We are both busy with work and pretty conflicting schedules, she\u2019s in school for nursing and has a lot on her plate. That\u2019s why she left me, she said. She just doesn\u2019t want to be in a relationship and wants to focus on work and school, it has nothing to do with me and she feels so bad and she\u2019s truly sorry, she says. And I believe her, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s just saying that while turning around n fucking another dude or anything, she seemed genuine, she even teared up a bit. So this had nothing at all to do with drugs, we were only together 2 months but I really enjoyed being with her. She gave me hope that I can be more than I was. Fuck, she proved that I am more than I thought I was. Then she decides she needs to focus on her future, and I respond by going and doing heroin. How is that fair to her? Not that she\u2019ll ever know, but shit imagine if I died. My family, and her, they don\u2019t deserve it. I\u2019m simply a selfish asshole and I am aware\n\nI love you all and please keep fighting your demons, do not let them win you over \n\nI\u2019m sorry",

She wanted me to pay the phone bill and kept going from politely asking to bring absolute rage that I wouldn\u2019t help. I finally paid it to get her to leave me alone. \n\nNow she claims she has a job lined up and has found a car to buy. She wants money from me to buy it with and after asking nicely became enraged that I wouldn\u2019t help. She claimed her family is trying to destroy her and that I fell for their tricks. This is something she\u2019s claimed in the past as well. It\u2019s now morphed in to everyone wanting to destroy her, including me and that I\u2019m finding this whole situation funny. That I\u2019m enjoying it.  Again something that\u2019s happened before when we\u2019ve dealt with her addiction. \n\nSo I\u2019m just wondering if this is normal behavior?",

I know I'm not the only one..\n\nI've been self harming since a younger age for 10+ years on and off. I've tried to quit so many times but I just can't make it stay. I remember the first time doing it, I was young and picking up shards of broken glass from a picture frame that my abusive father had broken, I just felt this strong impulse to run the glass against the grain on my skin. From there, I tried burning myself, shredding the skin on the palm of my hands, and just a razor blade. I developed scarring because I would give in too much when I was in high school and dealing with body, family and relationship issues. I would always do it in places people can't see. It started on my shoulder, I went too far down and moved to doing it on my upper thigh/hip region. Every mental breakdown I have I'll bang my head against a wall trying to control the need to cut. Recently, I've had to get more creative doing it being in a relationship and not wanting to leave scarring/discoloration. I have a friend with Diabetes, who always has sharps on her. I stole a bunch of her sharps (the finger pricking kind) and have been using those and squeezing my finger and letting the blood trickle (gross, I know) but it's not the same, it helps with cravings but doesn't give me the same feeling. When I cut I just zone out and sort of dissociate, I feel the pain that just feels like a sunburn but I also feel warm and fuzzy.  I can just zone out the world around me no matter what's going on around me, and I could care less about the panic attack I just had or why it happened. \nMy therapist and psych both know I'm doing this and my history, but they don't see it as a concern as I'm doing it for symptom relief. Before this last month or so I hadn't done it for 2 years, and 3 before that. The first several years I did it I never quit. Both don't see it on the same level as addiction, I want to be in some form of outpatient therapy for it or a group therapy but it doesn't seem like there is any in my area for a self harming addiction, just drugs and alcohol. Idk how to make people understand and I'm sorry if I'm sounding ignorant. But you know that feeling you get when you're having a really bad day and you're incredibly stressed out and just can't control your emotions? Where others would reach for alcohol or drugs or a cigarette, I reach for a blade. I have thoughts of harming myself regularly, I imagine it in my head and it's a thought that isn't easily shaken in times of high stress. Does anybody else have problems with this or have any recommendations or treatment options??",

We try to make all of these drastic changes in all sorts of aspects of our lives and make this miraculous 180 in regards to our lifestyle, and we wonder why we keep stumbling and having to start again time after time.\n\nStart with the smallest changes possible, and I mean changes so small they are hard to recognize as being a change.\n\nStay out of your bedroom during the day and go to another room to relax on the couch. If you go back to sleep or take a nap out there that is totally fine but for this very first small change lets just stay out of our bed/bedroom during daylight hours. \n\nYou dont have to make your whole bed if you are not feeling up to it but just straighten out your blanket like you would if you were making your bed- now you've set a goal, met a goal and accomplished something within a few minutes of waking up. \n\nIf you don't feel like cooking for yourself, thats totally ok. Make a sandwich or graze on something here and there to give yourself some nourishment and get the mind/ body/ natural endorphins going for the day.\n\nStart writing a journal. The only requirement I would suggest for that would be to make sure you date every entry- this gives yourself a tangible timeline where you can really see your ups, downs and all-around's. Write about yourself like a diary. Write about your strengths and \"victories\" in recovery and situations you make it through without using. Write up your weaknesses, mistakes and things you would like to change about yourself. \n\nWrite up some very, very small goals if/when you are feeling up to it. Maybe getting outside for a few minutes at a time, then eventually go for a walk around the block. Who knows, it could even lead to a new hobby of yours or you may take up jogging, etc.\n\nI guess what I am trying to say is that lifelong means lifelong. Anything you do besides using is a positive, and an accomplishment you need to recognize and be happy with yourself about it. \n\nIt will take some time, but it is far better to take 5x longer to reach a goal and get that accomplishment in the first attempt and get it done and out of the way  than it is to try rushing into it and failing- and having to do it over and over again, and possibly never reaching that goal.\n\nStay well friends.",

I advised doctors, lawyers, and business owners on portfolio allocation and advanced estate planning and tax minimization strategies.  My company flew in world renowned Harvard Economists for our sales trainings type shit.  I had a corporate card and could fly to our home office on a whim anytime I wanted to. Shit sometimes I would fly back for the day just to bullshit with my boss and old coworkers. \n\nYesterday I had to drive 3.5 hours for my new company\u2019s sales training.  This sales training is hosted by one individual that never even sold in our industry.  But \u201che knows how to sell\u201d I guess. He puts up these kindergarten type posters all over the room.  Makes us repeat his mantras word for word with big goofy hand gestures.  Makes everyone get up and scream and yell and gets pissed if we don\u2019t stand up and scream and yell every time someone from the hotel staff comes in the room to get our coffee.  I\u2019m not saying that I am too good for that, but it does nothing to help us move units.  There\u2019s very little sales strategy and product knowledge discussed.  It\u2019s all based around \u201cyou can do it!\u201d \u201cReach inside and dig deep!\u201d  Whatever... it\u2019s fine.... I\u2019m lucky to have this job. IM LUCKY TO HAVE THIS JOB. IM LUCKY TO HAVE THIS JOB.\n\nAnyways on our lunch break I am standing in the hotel lobby and I over hear a finance discussion by what looked to be a hedge fund or investment team.  A couple of young Asians and older manager engaged in a discussion about market returns for different sectors.  It was my old job shit.  I knew that discussion.  I had that discussion daily for years.  They were all dressed in professional shit like I used to wear.  They all had MacBook pros.  But damn they were ENGAGED and excited about the content of their discussion and looked like they were making good money.  THEY didn\u2019t fuck up and do meth.  They didn\u2019t piss away their education and years of day in and day out grinding.  \n\nI stood and listened for a while.  I haven\u2019t felt that type of envy in a long time.  I went back to our company training and sat down feeling numb.  The store I work for is way down in sales and the heat is coming down on us.  My boss is not handling it well at all. Desperation is a stinky cologne type shit.  They literally tell us what they want us to say to our customers to try and get them to buy and I cringe at the shit, but I still give it my all and a fair chance.  BUT  this is like a 1970 used car salesman hard grind to get them to close.  \u201cOh they are saying they are going to lunch to think about it?? Ok here, hand them $10 and tell them to bring you back something! See, that way they HAVE to come back!\u201d  \n\nOr\n\n\u201cOk, when you walk up there, just stick out your hand and say congratulations!! You must be living right!\u201d  \u201cWe couldn\u2019t get the price that you wanted, but we got close! You want to pick it up on Tuesday or Wednesday?\u201d\n\nThey want the customer to be uncomfortable. They want us to make them squirm in their seat. \u201cThat\u2019s how you know you are doing your job right!\u201d\n\nPeople have the internet these days. They aren\u2019t fucking morons. They aren\u2019t going to make a big ticket purchase because you conned them into the sale.  These days you need a good product and a good price to compete.  You can\u2019t sell them bullshit consistently with an assumptive close.  We had the top salesman in the whole company and he was a close friend of mine and he got fed up and left.  He didn\u2019t hard close people. He knew our inventory and listened to what they said.  That, and he hustled.  But he didn\u2019t hard line and bull people into buying and I hate that mentality.  It may have worked 20 years ago, but I just don\u2019t see it working in today\u2019s age.  Maybe I am wrong.\n\nAnyways we get back from lunch and I feel like absolute shit.  A very deep-to-the-core level of shiftiness.  My eyes watered but I held it together.  Now this guy plays music and wants us to repeat after him and stand up and do all these goofy hand gestures likes it\u2019s fucking kindergarten.  I put on my best fake smile and toughed it out.\n\nOn my way home I kept thinking about that stupid conversation I overheard.  I pulled into get gas and I couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore.  I just blurted our and started bawling and just cried my ass of for a few minutes.  I almost feel like crying now shit.\n\nPutting your life back together sober is fucking hard.  Just a frustrating day and needed to vent.",

            "selftext": "I quit for about 6 months, then relapsed one night on some really shitty stuff that barely got me high, and have been clean from coke again for about 3 months now. I first got into it when an ex bf introduced it to me. Once we broke up, I didn't use because I always went through him to get it. He was very abusive so I had to cut ties completely when we broke up for my own safety. I then found someone else who could supply me with some, but that is no longer possible since her dealer has left the city and she has since quit using, so I really don't have any way to actually relapse. However, I am fucking miserable. It is constantly on my mind. I figured after a few months, this would go away, but it hasn't. I smoke pot most nights now, not because I enjoy it but because I just really don't want to be sober (and it's legal here so it's very accessible) because when I'm sober, I can't stop thinking about coke. If I drink, the cravings get even worse.\n\nEvery single thing I do, I have the overwhelming thought that it would be better if I was on coke. And then I try and enjoy things without it and it just seems boring and dull. I was never using enough to become dependent or to hit rock bottom - so I really only have good memories associated with it, which makes it harder to deter myself.\n\nI am looking for any help, tips, support, etc. I feel so stuck. I have some heavy depression and mental health problems, and being high on that was the only thing that really ever sucked me out of that depression (mind you, it only lasted a night and then I felt shitty the next day, but a night is better than nothing). I feel like I am never going to feel as good as I did when I was on it.",

My thoughts have been weaker recently, but up until the last month or so, also pretty on point. But I feel like my desires are still for the addiction. I wish I could act on it. I don't want any of the crap that comes with it, so I don't, but I still want it. I still have that addiction. Does it diminish more with time? Do I just acknowledge that that's just how it is and that it's okay that my desire is that way, since I am powerless to change my desires? I have my intentions for good. I pray to have good desires and to be free, but I haven't been given that blessing, yet. How worried should I be about that? I feel like only God can change that part of me and bring that healing. If he hasn't felt it's time for it, yet, should I feel guilty over it?\n\nOr just acknowledge it's there and try to move on with life otherwise. Makes me think of that \"A Beautiful Mind\" movie about the guy with schizophrenia. He just learns to acknowledge that things that aren't real are there and moves on otherwise.",

            "selftext": "One year ago today, I was sitting in some dirty, run down trap house in a tiny bedroom with other addicts helping my boyfriend try and find a good vein in my arm to shoot up in.\n\nThis was my day to day reality. I still can\u2019t believe just how fast and hard crystal meth took me down.\n\nI\u2019ve struggled with addiction for over nine years. Until about two years ago, my drugs of choice were alcohol and cocaine. I\u2019ve never tried things like heroin or fentanyl because my thing when I\u2019m high is I want to feel energized and awake. I stopped using both alcohol and cocaine however, when I was introduced to meth.\n\nMeth was like nothing I\u2019d ever experienced before. The first time I used, I shot up. The rush it gave me was unlike anything I\u2019d ever felt before. I felt it from my scalp to my toes. I loved it. I decided right there that THIS was what I wanted. This was all I wanted.\n\nAnyways, within the first month of getting hooked I sold all my electronics and most of my clothes just to get my next high. I was dating a man at the time who was conveniently a meth dealer and so I would also get plenty for free from him. It was awful. I stopped eating. I stopped bathing except for when I could no longer stand the awful stink that was coming off of me. I had to force myself every few days to take things like Xanax or benzos just so that I could sleep and stop the extreme paranoia and auditory hallucinations.\n\nIt took being sent to the hospital after my boyfriend beat me for the fifth time to decide that I wanted to quit.\n\nAfter that, I took a long look at myself and where I\u2019d ended up in life. I guess the reality of how awful things were finally hit me and I had a complete breakdown. I checked myself into detox shortly after and I\u2019ve been sober ever since.\n\nI\u2019ve joined a support group and we have meetings a few times a week. Ironically, the area where I now attend these meetings to help me stay sober is the same area I used to get high in. It\u2019s the most dangerous part of the city. Walking through there now that I am no longer using is really shocking and makes me sad. \n\nPeople often ask if it\u2019s triggering for me and why don\u2019t I just go elsewhere for help? My answer is that I find in empowering to be able to walk around there and not use. It shows me just how strong I really am. I think that if I can stay sober around there, I can stay sober anywhere.\n\nMaybe 4 months isn\u2019t actually a lot of clean time but to me it\u2019s a huge accomplishment. For the first time in a very long time, I feel like I actually have a shot at a good life. Like, yeah, maybe I can do this. \n\nI can\u2019t say for sure that this is it and that I\u2019ll never relapse. Addiction is the biggest struggle in my life and I can\u2019t predict the future. What I am sure of though, is that for today I\u2019m choosing sobriety and if I keep working hard, I\u2019ll never have to pick up drugs again.",

Usually, I would be able to recognize that something was happening and I wasn't thinking clearly so I could put off doing anything irrational long enough for it to pass. Now, for some reason, it seems like these thoughts are starting to slowly become constant and intertwined with my regular thinking and I can't tell if I'm right or not. I've learned to not trust myself but it becoming so constant is hard to handle and I hate not being able to trust myself whatsoever. I know that I'm wrong but often in the moment I can convince myself that I'm right and I should use again. It's confusing and I'm scared that if it keeps progressing I might fuck up and convince myself enough at the right time to be able to get more DXM. Not being able to tell what's real and what's an urge is honestly scary and I'm not sure what to do.",

I had a beautiful childhood, but it all turned shit when I went to highschool. I got bullied for being fat and I wasn't living up to the expecations everybody set for me. During this time, I started to develop a severe depression.\n\nSoon I started smoking cigarettes with friends, cigarettes turned into alcohol, alcohol turned into weed. At the age of 16, I was smoking cigarettes, weed and drank alcohol on a daily basis.\n\nAs soon as I got my first job (kind of an internship where I live) at 17, I started selling weed and taking harder drugs like speed or ecstasy several times a week. At this time I didn't know I was depressed because I was constantly high/drunk.\n\nNowadays, I have kind of a stable life and a good job, but I'm still struggeling with the addiction. I quit ecstasy and speed, but I smoke about 5 joints and drink a bottle a day.\n\nI don't want it anymore, the addicition is taking my will to live. Today, for the first time in my life, I reached out for help. I don't want this anymore. I'm 24 years old and I'm struggeling. My friends and family think that I'm doing perfectly fine because I have a great job and make it seem like I have my shit together. \n\nIn reality, I just want to cry. I tried to stop several times and couldn't achieve shit. I'm constantly depressed. I actually need to be high/drunk before meeting family or friends to make it seem like I'm happy and cheerful. I drink during the day at work, everyday.\n\nI did a lot of stupid shit in my life, I hurt people who loved and supported me everyday, I let the love of my life go and missed so many opportunities in my life just because drugs and alcohol were my priority.\n\nActually, I have no idea what I'm doing here. Today, I flushed all the weed and other drugs I had in my apartment down the toilet. Today I had the strength to say no for this first time in a long time. Today is the first day since a long time that I feel like I can change my life.",

Symptoms the first 3 days: low back pain, stomach ache, diarrhea, insane insomnia, restless limbs. These symptoms now subsided since yesterday. New symptoms: Bloating, burning sensation in stomach and not throat or chest, diarrhea. Since these symptoms showed up soo late, and some of these symptoms aren't labeled in withdraw symptoms of both alcohol and kratom, I'm beginning to believe its something else. I'm contemplating using kratom to relieve pain. Does this sound like anything else than withdraw?",

            "selftext": "## One of my Good Friends Died the other day and I Think its time that I get some Help....\n\nOne of my good good friends just recently passed away and I didnt even go to his funeral because the last time him and i spoke was when he was trying to have an intervention with me and showed up to my house in college with one of my other best friends and my dad at around 6 am one morning carrying a drug test and telling me that i needed to get clean.\n\nHowever, at the time i was young, immature, and in denial of my addiction and fought and hated him for it and not approaching me first. I held on to that resentment and the struggle between him and I only grew. We never really hated each other and the only reason we were upset at each other was because of the way the drugs had changed me. He was one of my good good friends and one of my best friends older brothers.. He took his own life the other day and it was the last thing any of us expected.. He was such a wonderful and beautiful person whose soul was so deep and caring if you were one of the lucky ones he cared about and knew.\n\nSo when i got the news and went to go and look at his instagram for some pictures and saw that the account was private but yet it said \"follow back\" meaning that he followed me but because i was so stubborn and in denial from the drugs at the time, i couldn't even befriend him on a social media platform when all he did was try and save my life.\n\nIts been almost 10 years since then, and that intervention and i just lost my girlfriend because she caught me doing drugs, didn't dump me, allowed me to get clean, and then when she went on a 3 week vacation i slipped up again and she just found out and left me..\n\nSo the times now, i'm ready for it all to be done and i need to face the facts that i'm addicted and no matter how easily i can get off the substances I cant do it for an extended period of time. I hate my life and whats its become because of the drugs and the effects it's had on every aspect of my life, including my good friend who just passed away.\n\nSo in memory of him and our friendship I am going to get clean and stay clean and hope you guys might be able to help me. I dont have health insurance and i've heard how much rehabs can be, whats the best way to go about paying for something like that and are there such things as scholarships, grants, or any alternative ways to get help with the price of it all and paying for it?\n\nAny information will be greatly appreciated thank you!",

I grew up in a pretty strict household where my mother would monitor who I would hangout with which maybe helped me stay away from the \u201cbad kids\u201d.\nI didn\u2019t try any drugs until I was about 22 when I was in one of my first seriously relationships and very far away from my family. He introduced me to oxy and cocaine for the first time. I\u2019ve always been afraid of drugs because I\u2019m pretty sure I knew I\u2019d love them. Ever since then, anytime I have the chance to do drugs or buy them, I binge it. \n\nAt one point I was abusing adderall everyday for a few months to help me with work. Quit cold turkey and binged cocaine for a few months. Quit again cold turkey. I started vaping, literally would chain smoke that all day and I never even smoke cigarettes before that. I gave someone my vape and told them to never let me have it again. Went to Thailand for a month and chained smoked cigarettes everyday. Stopped when I came back to the states. Did oxy everyday for 3 months up until a few weeks ago only because I found out they were pressed. I told myself I would never do whipits and then I started stealing boxes from my job, but then eventually stopped doing that as well.\n\nI am now writing this post while extremely high on cocaine and I have Xanax in my purse to prepare for the come down. I want to not want drugs but I also don\u2019t want to stop at the same time. Btw, I hate smoking weed. Thank you for reading.",

I am still using marijuana, alcohol and cigarettes. I haven't yet had a callback from my mental health clinic referral. I don't have the money for counselling and free services do not assist with trauma informed counsel. Next week I will be able to afford medication for my diagnosed anxiety and depression. I am hoping that I can use this as a platform to create my own contentment. The power players in my life have all turned their backs on me, recognising my codependence. The one I love unconditionally had her conditions broken by me and thus, here we are. I will take control. I hope that I can get through tonight with a rest included. I will try my best to update.",

            "selftext": "My nose was raw, my heart was pounding, but my life force - non-existent. \nDon't be confused. I felt euphoric and able. The day ahead was something to anticipate, not dread. And by dread I mean fear with all of the stress my stomach could contain, and then some. \n\nWhen I woke up, my cure all was next to the bed, folded in a receipt and carefully placed in the zippered pocket on the back of my guitar case. This is how I kept the tears, anxiety induced vomit, and uncontrollable mood swings at bay. \n\nAfter the fix I was enjoying a shower, singing while I styled my hair, artfully applying winged eyeliner and marrying a black floral dress with combat boots.\n\nI made the bed, took the dog out and said bye to mom. She asked me if I wanted to bring leftovers for lunch. I refused but thanked her warmly. She asked me why I hardly ever eat. I executed an excuse.\n\nPulling out of the driveway I wondered who I would be if I wasn't an addict. I wondered who could tell. I lied to myself that my family didn't know, that it was better for them if I stayed this way. After all, when I'm high I'm able to be around more. I enjoy being around them and have the energy to keep up with life.\n\nAfter work I came home, did laundry, tended to my garden and the remaining housework. I acted casual and made a couple of trips to the bathroom. Flushing the toilet to drowned out the sounds of pills crushing, all the while waiting for the text. \n\nThe text came at 10 p.m., I already had my excuse ready. I've been \"getting guitar lessons\" from a friend at work. \n\nFree at last I peeled out of the driveway and navigated the rural mountain back roads to town. First I had to go to my dealers while the getting was still good, then I could make my way to my friends where we split up the pills the 3 of us went in on. \n\nMe, Keith and Waze got high in the kitchen and made our way downstairs to shoot shit and smoke cigarettes. I held the flashlight for Waze while he skillfully worked magic under the hood of his truck. We were good, felt the euphoria coursing through our brains while making witty small talk.\n\nThen I realized Keith had come back from the bathroom. Making my way up the stairs I yelled for him louder than necessary in the spirit of love-hate friendship. \n\nI found him in his room, face down and unresponsive. Saliva dripping onto the floor, lips an unnatural purply-pink. Screaming for Waze I sat him up and started slapping and shaking him. All of the panic and fear I'd been numbing crashed into me with the force of earthquake, followed by the unstoppable landslide of dread. \n\nI went several more months without be able to quit using. Keith survived after the paramedics brought him back. He never spoke to me again after that night. Who could blame him? I was supposed to be his friend and I almost killed him. I stopped his heart. \n\nShortly after, I underwent severe withdrawal by myself. No one knew. I was in horrible condition and should have gotten medical care but then everyone would know. The opiate withdrawals made me want to die. The dehydration caused from vomiting combined with the mental anguish and body aches is something I will never forget. \n\nTwo weeks later I relapsed.\n\nAfter 5 years of addiction, I knew there was only one way to stay clean. I had tried and failed too many times in that town that I knew it wasn't possible, so I did the only thing I knew would work. I left. \n\nWith only the clothes on my back, I got in my car and drove halfway across the country to my dad's house. There was guilt, sadness, and uncertainty. I had to read myself from my mom, sister, grandparents, aunts and cousins, dog, job, friends, and all of the belongings but it HAD to be done. And the freedom I felt was like hot bath in the middle of winter. I soaked in it and smiled from my soul.\n\nOne and a half years later, I am the manager of SEO at one of the largest e-commerce companies in North America. Everyday I take a few minutes to look out of the wall of windows lining our 9th floor office and take in the freedom. I thank God for saving my life and bringing me from the brink of death to life, and life abundingly. \n\nMy story has never been told until now, and that's because it didn't need to be. But to many of you, it means life. There IS hope so reach out and TAKE it. No one can do that but you and as long as you don't, your amazing and opportunistic life is passing you by. You will see and experience amazing things, achieve goals you can't even imagine, and truly love your life instead of just surviving it. \n\nYour hope, your time is now.",

            "selftext": "Clean off coke for 4 months now.  This is normally where I trip up, seems like the cycle is repeating.  \n\nI've made a lot of progress.  I have a job I like (pays less but the fringe benefits are well worth it), am taking classes again, started exercising pretty regularly/seriously, reinvested in hobbies and reconnected with (non-using) family and friends. I have a few trips and concerts lined up for the rest of the summer.  \n\nI live in a dry house (no drugs/alcohol allowed, that's pretty much the only caveat.).   I've been drinking a little, about once a week over the past month but I think I'm going to curb that.  It hasn't been helping anything and bars are expensive.\n\nI've been having some relapse ideation and haven't deleted my dealer's contact information even though I know that would pretty much solve the problem indefinitely.  I have a windfall forthcoming, about $1k that could/should go into savings, but I am finding myself fantasizing about getting a hotel room and going on a bender, like \"I earned it\" or \"it will get it out of my system\" kind of thing.  I never have made it much farther than where I'm at now and I'm a bit scared that I will act on these impulses.  \n\nI should involve a friend or relative and have them hold the money for me but I'm pretty stubborn about that kind of stuff.  Maybe that's why I've never made it past this point.  The fucked up thing is that, even though I know it will probably lead me back to regular use, I kind of am losing motivation in recovery.  It's not that my life hasn't improved drastically, it has probably more than in any other attempt.  But the self-reflection gets tiresome.  I still have spells of hating myself and fantasizing about self-destruction/suicide.  I think on a very deep level I hate myself, and I don't see that changing any time soon or ever.    \nSo yeah, I should call a friend, make sure somebody intercepts that cash and reinvest in my recovery but for some reason today I am just really stuck on the idea of taking a little mental vacation next week.  Maybe it's just a bad day.   \nI'm going to go run a few miles and see how I feel.  History has told me that this is normally as far as I get.  Guess we'll see.",

            "selftext": "This is extremely long.\n\nI am at a loss I feel like... &amp; I want/need to stop... I am diagnosed w PTSD, BiPolar, OCD, ADD, severe depression &amp; anxiety. To keep things short, I went thru a lot at a young age.. which I feel like kick started all of my mental illnesses... I have never been good at dealing w my emotions at all.\n\nFirst off, I am a single mother to two amazing children who are my world. I felt like my mental illness\u2019s were taking away my quality of life. So, about three years ago I decided to see a psychiatrist to get on meds. I wanted to be a better person for my children. Before I got on my meds, I have never abused any type of drug.\n\nHere\u2019s a list of meds i\u2019m on, Adderall, gabapentin, wellbutrin, lamotragine.\n\nIt all started w Adderall. I took it as prescribed for a while. I noticed a huge difference in my ADD &amp; motivation. I\u2019ve struggled w ADD my whole life. &amp; was also attending college. After feeling so low for so long it was amazing at how much it improved what it is intended for. I am on 10mg ir twice daily.\n\nAlthough Adderall relieved my anxiety, my comedown made my anxiety worse. I was then prescribed gabapentin 300mg three times daily. For my bipolar, anxiety, &amp; agitation issues. It was amazing. It made taking Adderall completely bearable &amp; I was a much more enjoyable person to be around. Those two completely changed my life. I never felt as good as I did on those meds (at my prescribed dosage) in my life.\n\nMy wellbutrin definitely improved my depression &amp; the tiredness that came along w depression. Obviously I have no issues w this med other than slight increases in anxiety. I no longer take my lamotragine as I found it doesn\u2019t seem to give me any benefits.\n\nI was starting to feel like a \u201cnormal\u201d person. I felt like I was a better person for my kids. I wasn\u2019t too depressed to do anything w them etc. here\u2019s where it all went down hill. Of course, my meds weren\u2019t living up to how they were before. I built a tolerance, &amp; somehow ended up feeling even shittier than I did before taking them. So I did the dumb thing &amp; ended up taking more Adderall than prescribed daily. I would take doses ranging from 10mg-50mg daily until I ran out. Then I had to deal w withdrawal &amp; sleeping 14 hours a day for a few days &amp; feeling so low &amp; worthless until my next refill. Since I was taking more Adderall, my comedowns would be more intense.\n\nIn result of that, again, so dumb, I would take more of my gabapentin. Averaging about 2100mg per day until I ran out... &amp; when I ran out of both it was a living hell. I was so desperate for an alternative I started searching for something to help. Until I came across Phenibut. I started using Phenibut only for when I ran out of gabapentin. It certainly helped hold me over &amp; stopped my withdrawal. Now i\u2019m in a deeper hole. I\u2019ve been on Phenibut daily for 3 months. I\u2019m up to 2g\u2019s daily. Occasionally taking an extra gram every so often based on my anxiety.\n\nAfter going through all of this for three years i\u2019ve realized it\u2019s not worth it. I have horrible rebound anxiety from it all. I feel like i\u2019m now worse than I was before. I want to get off of it all. I\u2019m doing it mainly for my kids... i feel like it\u2019s starting to ruin relationships for me. I now feel like I NEED to be on something in order to be around people. &amp; if something happens that gives me anxiety it only makes me want to take more even knowing it\u2019ll have a negative effect.\n\nI want to stop while i\u2019m ahead. I recently took two days off of Phenibut &amp; gabapentin &amp; experienced horrible withdrawal. Itching, cold sweats, puking, headache, extreme depression, nausea, really tired, brain fog, no interest in anything at all, no motivation, complete isolation. Being how I was before meds was way better than dealing w this. I don\u2019t want to live like this anymore. I don\u2019t want to worry about withdrawal. Or feeling like I have to be on something to feel \u201cnormal\u201d.\n\nMy daughters dad suffered w heroin addiction, he\u2019s now been clean for 3 years. My dad was an alcoholic my whole childhood. &amp; my uncle just passed from heroin addiction. My aunt has lost her mind to addiction &amp; the family hasen\u2019t heard from her in years... I don\u2019t ever want to rely on a substance. &amp; luckily, it\u2019s not hard drugs. Which I would never let myself get into. But this still is not easy. I\u2019m going to start tapering now &amp; get off all meds, except for wellbutrin. I\u2019m just afraid after being on them for so long, how hard reality is going to hit me when off of them. I know i\u2019m going to want to go back. But i\u2019m staying strong because this shit is not worth it. I\u2019ve completely lost myself. I refuse to ever go back once i\u2019m off. I want to do this &amp; I have to do this.",

I'm only about... A week or so since stopping and I have urges to get a sip almost every day. It's a struggle but I believe God will allow me to overcome.

I don't waste money on the devil poison. I don't think about coke when I'm drinking a couple of pints. At this point I don't even know anyone who does drugs. I don't miss my party friends anymore. I don't miss cocaine.\n\n\n\nI've recieved a couple of PMs since I posted last. Thank you everyone.

            "selftext": "&gt;\u2026on the basis of widely shared ideas and a few facts, it is possible to create a story that addiction must be chronic. The line of reasoning goes like this: Self-destructive behaviour implies sickness. Addiction is self-destructive, therefore it is an illness. If it is an illness, then the only way to get better is to seek help at a clinic. But addicts who get help at clinics do not get better; they keep using drugs. Therefore, all addicts, those in the clinic and those out, must keep using drugs, which is to say, addiction is a \u201cchronic, relapsing disease.\u201d This is a perfectly sensible line of reasoning, and it would yield a valid picture of the world if self-destructive behaviour implies illness, and if those addicts who participated in the treatment studies were representative of addicts in general. However, those in the clinic are not representative, and, in Chapter 7 and 7, it is shown that **voluntary actions can be consistently self-destructive**. \\[ [Addiction: A Disorder of Choice](https://www.amazon.ca/Addiction-Disorder-Gene-M-Heyman/dp/0674057279), by Gene M. Heyman, my emphasis \\] \n\nEver heard the expression \"[like there's no tomorrow](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/like-there-s-no-tomorrow)\"? It's a well-known expression, because people *frequently* behave 'like there's no tomorrow.' Often, our behaviour is centred on getting what we want *today;* not what we want tomorrow or next month or *ten years from now.* We commonly act without considering the long-term consequences of our behaviour.\n\nFor example: A woman may spend her evening on the couch, in front of the television, eating ice cream. She is doing what she wants to do *this evening.* Tomorrow, she will do what she wants to do *tomorrow evening.* Again, she will sit on the couch, in front of the television, eating ice cream. Ice cream tastes good. She likes her TV show. Over many years, this woman will become obese and develop diabetes. If you think about \"eating ice cream in front of the TV\" in terms of *How will this affect my life over the next ten years?* then you will be tempted to conclude that this woman is insane: Why would any sane person *voluntarily choose* to do these kinds of self-destructive things?\n\nThe answer is that this woman is not thinking about the future, and her actions are not *immediately* self-destructive. She's thinking about getting what she wants *right now.* This woman is living *one day at a time*, not bothering to consider how her daily choice to watch TV and eat ice cream is going to affect her health over the long-term. If you think about \"eating ice cream in front of the TV\" in terms of *How can I enjoy my evening?* then the woman's choice makes a lot of sense. \n\nI notice that many 'addicts' get hit with the long-term consequences of prolonged drinking or drug abuse, and then they insist that *no sane person would ever choose to do what I did!* I've said the same thing, myself. My addiction left me homeless &amp; broke. *I must be crazy,* I thought, *to have put myself in this kind of situation! There must be something wrong with my brain, that* ***makes*** *me do this to myself. No sane person ould ever choose to do what I did, because look at the horrible long-term consequences!*\n\nYeah, exactly: **Look at the long-term consequences!** The long-term consequences are what I *failed to consider* while I was getting high. The future is what I *wasn't* thinking about when I made the decision to get drunk, smoke crack, snort meth, pop pills. If you're living *one day at a time,* if you're living 'like there's no tomorrow,' it's entirely reasonable to get high. A **day** spent on drugs might be the happiest day of your life; a **life** spent on drugs is a life wasted. \n\n*Normal, non-crazy people* choose to engage in self-destructive behaviour (e.g. drugs) because they are thinking about how to have the best possible **day**. Normal, non-crazy people make very foolish, short-sighted decisions, especially when they're teenagers/young adults \\[as most addicts are\\].",

I\u2019m tired of my Sunday motivation and game plan giving way to my Friday fiend. I know what I have to do but I\u2019m afraid I lack the strength to. I love my friends but if I really want to change I have to distance myself from them, at least temporarily. Truth is though, deep down I had every intention of buying cocaine last night and I called up my friends and bought beer so that I\u2019d have an excuse this morning. \u201cOh man it\u2019s not my fault it\u2019s the liquor, and being around my triggers\u201d. Screw that I\u2019m done with all the excuses and not owning up to my own faults. It\u2019s time to get serious about this and the first step to that is being honest with myself.

Three months into our relationship he told me that he loved me and then proceeded to tell me that he was an addict. I had no clue that he was an addict prior to him telling me. After he told me about his addiction he was prepared for me to leave him but I didn\u2019t. I love him so much but I don\u2019t know how much longer I can do this. Countless times he has taken money from me. Countless times I\u2019ve driven him to pick up. I know that he has a disease and that when he takes from me, it\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t love me, it\u2019s that his love for heroin is stronger. His addiction has affected our relationship in so many ways and it fucking sucks. We haven\u2019t had sex in three months because he\u2019d rather be high. It makes me feel like I need more reassurance and I don\u2019t have as much confidence as a used to. Does he still find me attractive? Is he cheating on me? Does he still love me? \n\nHe has tried going sober a few times but it hasn\u2019t lasted longer than a week. He got prescribed suboxone  but sold it for H. I know he is tired of using and he wants to stop but he actually hasn\u2019t really given a real effort. Nearly everyday he tells me \u201cit\u2019s my last time\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ll pay you back I promise\u201d and they\u2019re all just empty promises. I\u2019m so drained from being constantly let down and it sucks because I love him.\n\nI guess I\u2019m just looking for some support and advice if anyone has been through something similar. No one in my life knows about this because I know everyone will tell me I need to leave. I have hope because I don\u2019t want this to end because he can\u2019t get clean. This is the person that I want in my life for the rest of my life and I don\u2019t want to lose him to this disease.",

            "selftext": "(a philosophical satire written to encourage a complete rethinking of our modern attitudes toward addiction and its treatment)\n\n&gt;SCENE: 12 adults seated in a circle.\n\nJOHN SMITH: My name is John Smith and I\u2019m a miserable wretch.\n\n[GROUP MEMBERS TITTER RELUCTANTLY, FINALLY BREAKING OUT INTO FULL-BLOWN LAUGHTER]\n\nSMITH: What? What\u2019s so funny?\n\n[LAUGHTER CONTINUES]\n\nLEADER: You\u2019ll have to forgive us, Johnny boy, but you must not get around much these days.\n\nSMITH: What do you mean? I thought the whole point of addiction therapy was for me to find the protestant God of the Bible.\n\nLEADER: Oh, yeah?\n\nSMITH: Or at least a reasonable facsimile thereof.\n\n[LAUGHTER RESUMES]\n\nSMITH: That\u2019s why I started out with the customary self-abasement and grovelling.\n\nLEADER: That is so 21st century of you, dawg. The point of modern therapy is simply to SHOW YOU GOD \u2013 or \u201cat least a reasonable facsimile thereof,\u201d as you put it.\n\nSMITH: What?\n\nLEADER: Everything else follows from that point, bruh: self-respect, respect for others, temperance, you name it.\n\nSMITH: And just how do you intend to show me God?!\n\nLEADER: Earth to Smith: Americans stopped criminalizing Mother Nature over fifty years ago!!!\n\nSMITH: Meaning?\n\nLEADER: Meaning we have amassed a whole pharmacy worth of psychoactive plants and fungi with which we can now ceremonially lead you on a voyage of inner discovery\u2026\n\nSMITH: Yeah?\n\nLEADER: \u2026after which you\u2019ll see the folly of addiction \u2013 always assuming, of course, that you enter our program in good faith, committed to learning from Mother Nature.\n\nSMITH: Oh.\n\nLEADER: Get it?\n\nSMITH (reluctantly): Well\u2026 I guess\u2026\n\nLEADER: Good.\n\nSMITH: All I can say is that the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous is probably rolling over in his grave right now.\n\nLEADER: To the contrary, the legendary Bill W. was a big fan of treating addiction with LSD therapy\u2026\n\nSMITH: Really?\n\nLEADER: Until a corrupt politician by the name of Richard Nixon criminalized the substance in his effort to crack down on hippies.\n\nSMITH: Oh.\n\nLEADER: That\u2019s right: \u201cAlcoholics be damned,\u201d said Nixon, \u201cas long as I can get my own back against Timothy Leary!\u201d\n\nSMITH: Fair enough, I guess, but\u2026\n\nLEADER: Yes?\n\nSMITH: I still don\u2019t get how you\u2019re gonna make me see God.\n\nLEADER: As far as the specifics of the process, I\u2019d better turn you over to our team pharmacologist, Terence McKenna VIII. Terence?\n\nTERENCE: Well, jefe, the precise combination of plants that we use is a trade secret, of course, kind of like the 11 herbs and spices still used to this very day by KFC.\n\nLEADER: True dat. (Love me some KFC.)\n\nTERENCE: But I can give you a random list of some of the big-hitters in our line-up of therapeutic plants.\n\nLEADER: Proceed when ready.\n\nTERENCE: We\u2019ve got Acorus calamus, Amanita muscaria, Anadenantherea peregrina, Ariocarpus retusus Scheidw, Atropa belladonna, banisteriopsis caapi, Boletus manicus Heim\u2014\n\nLEADER: Enough, dawg. We don\u2019t want to provide a shopping list for our competitors in the therapy biz.\n\nTERENCE: Not to worry, bruh: these substances are useless (yea, even deadly) when used in the wrong doses\u2026\n\nLEADER: I heard that.\n\nTERENCE: \u2026or in the wrong set and setting.\n\nJOHN: But then why are we sitting around in a circle?\n\nLEADER: So you guys can get acquainted before we start our plant-guided rituals next week.\n\nJOHN: Oh.\n\nLEADER: Speaking of which, why don\u2019t you introduce yourself again?\n\nJOHN: OK.\n\nLEADER: But this time, go easy on the self-abasement, would ya?\n\nJOHN: Will do.\n\nLEADER: I think we can take it as a given that we all have much to learn from our plant friends. No need to dwell morbidly on that fact during this introductory session.",

I take karate because I hate exercising by myself. \n\n\nx. Writing, or painting, or doing something creative. I believe that creativity is the hidden high. \n\n\nx. Reading and relaxing. Before I did drugs, I read books and took naps. Brain stimulation and escapism. \n\n\nx. Playing games. Board games or video games. \n\nx. Sharing my experience.

When I got home, I was in my head. If you have been or currently are a coke addict, you know the obsessive feeling you get. Its all I could think about. I should have taken one line, it would have been fun, what would I feel if i took a line? Damn i wish i stayed and took a line. Im proud of myself for saying no, but why am I obsessing?

I just need to get this all out, identify where I went wrong and improve from there. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd been sober 209 days before I threw it all away. I'd been going through weeks of cravings, being in a bad place, not really doing anything about it.\\*1st mistake. I flirted with the thought of using, went down the rabbit hole at r/meth. \\*2nd mistake.\n\nOn the 30th, my mind kept switching back and forth between using. I'd text a dealer, then ignore him.  Decide I want to be sober for my sisters birthday, then get hooked by the idea of using. At night, I arranged to meet a dealer. He never showed.\n\nOn the 31st, I texted another dealer. While I was waiting for him, I texted my sister, asked her what she was doing. She texted back and invited me to join her. I told her I was going to do laundry. I get a pit in my stomach regretting not doing the right thing, for not putting my sister ahead of my desires. The same sister that took me into her room for 5 months, was there for me during my worst comedowns and never even suggested the idea of kicking me out even when I was using. Because she wanted me to be safe, she was more comfortable with me using in the house. A memory I have of her during this time is of her offering to get ice cream when I was in that bitchy teenage angsty comedown mode. I did this to her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI smoked with the dealer and craved intimacy. I wouldn't do this sober, but I sucked the dick of a guy I wasn't even attracted to. I think he penetrated me cause I bleed for a couple of days after. Unprotected.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the 1st of June, my sisters birthday, after a night of smoking,  we went to hike to a waterfall as planned. In the car I couldn't stop tearing up cause of the guilt. During the hike I couldn't keep up. At one point, every time I stood up I got light headed. My heart was pounding. The group moved on and it was just me, my sister and her boyfriend. \"You guys go ahead, I'll catch up later.\" \" With your condition right now, I don't feel comfortable with leaving you alone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat night, a nice place had been booked for my sisters birthday. I spent the entirety of it at my place carpet surfing/ ignoring calls. \"Hey, your sister looks kinda anxious that y're not here.\" \"Where are you? I'm freaking out here.\" I didn't feel anything. I didn't want to see anyone high. I didn't feel frantic to meet my sister.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally around 11:30pm I got out of the house and tried to make it to the party but I couldn't, my battery was too low. I told my sister I'd have to charge, we agreed it was too late. I spent the night crying to myself. The next day she texted me \"Sorry you couldn't make it the party.\" \"Sorry I couldn't bring myself to\" I replied.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2 days after, my sister invited me for breakfast and asked me about the lapse. Then she invited me on a road trip with her boyfriend. I brought a baggie along thinking I would taper orally. Even after everything, I'd rather not face what's to   come.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe entire roadtrip I was still stimmed but moody. Real party pooper. Over breakfast my sister asked me if I'd dumped my stuff, I came clean about the stuff in my bag and at home. \"I need you to tell you this because I can't be accountable for myself now\" (Someone slap this bitch) I really hate how meth makes you say a lot of nothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter the roadtrip I came back and dumped the stuff away. I was sober until today, when I found another baggie. Impulses kicked in and I smoked it. Even after everything, I still smoked it. And that's why I dont want to use anymore, cause even after everything, I still want to use, and that repulses me.",

            "selftext": "I've been an addict since I was young. I'm 28 now and over the last year I've realised I'm a compulsive liar both to myself and most everyone else. I started doing this as a young kid to get out of things with my parents (I was an only child) but now I see it's been a part of my adult life the entire time. I lie to cover up everything that may \"look\" shameful even small stuff. \n\nOver the last 9 months I've been trying to tell the truth about things but after I do I look back at what I said and it's still a cover up. Its like even when I'm trying to tell the real truth of what I'm trying to relay to someone its still not the real truth. The lies I've told myself and the people I love have so many layers it's insane. It's not like I've even dome really bad things that would require a lie, its just that I haven't wanted to be seen certain kinds of ways by my family so I've made up these stories so that I look more like they want me to look or think I look based on what image they already had of me from being a kid and what my parents told them.\n\nI've been getting sober from all substances I was addicted to these last 9 months so I can only imagine it stems from the addictions. During these 9 months I've been slowly unraveling these lies because I want to get to the core of who I've been so that I can move past it and be who I really am and not some false version of myself based in lies and addiction. \n\nI guess to the point of this entire post is to ask if any of you have experienced something similar? If so what has been your process for getting to the truth? I write a lot but its still taking a while to get through all the layers. I'd like to speed up this process and get on with actually living true to myself and behaving in that truth. It's my belief that by getting through all the bullshit lies and to the core, that staying away from my DOCs so to speak will become easy, as well as truly connecting to people because there won't be any covering up things, there will just be me. Thats all I want. Is the truth.",

            "selftext": "I am a recovering heroin addict clean for 3 years but am on methadone.  The only thing I have taken in the last 3 years is my methadone that I receive from a methadone clinic.  I have a court case from a couple years ago where I'm on probation and it should of been over this June 17th.  For probation they give me urine test monthly.  The urine tests keep showing that I'm positive for Fentanyl &amp; Norfentanyl (which is the metabolite of Fentanyl). This has been the same for 10 urine tests I have taken.  So, I paid to have a blood test done, out of curiosity, and the only thing that showed up in my blood test is methadone.  If I do not figure out why this is happening then at my next court date, June 25, 2019 the judge is locking me up w/out bond, which means I will loose everything.  I have been to doctors and hospitals but nobody will give me a definite answer, they just tell me it has to be the methadone, but I need a letter from a medical professional to show the court.  Does anyone know why this would happen or know of a medical professional, in the Chicago land area, that can help me figure this out.",

            "selftext": "Hello r/addiction. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently I have realized that I have way too many negative behavioral patterns. Whether you wanna call it an addictive personality, behavioral patterns developed over time, or something else. The fact is, I do not like myself for the developed human being/ structured consciousness that I am. I had a couple of traumatic experiences as a child, one of which was head trauma at the age of 6 and the other was molestation from the ages of 9 - 13. I am sure that these events have added to my developed personality, but that doesn't matter, because I know I don't want to be this way anymore. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am/was highly addicted to porn/PMO and constantly have controlling sexual thoughts, I smoke weed on a daily basis, I think I am a pathological liar, I am addicted to the ineffectual scrolling of Reddit, watching youtube videos, and listening to podcasts, and I am constantly thinking negative thoughts. I want to stop all of this. I feel like I've lost myself. There was once a version of me that was improving, constantly striving to be better, and practicing moderation, but that person is not currently me. I want so badly to conquer this dark beast inside of me and I want to thrive as my higher self. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been addicted to porn since I was 12/13 and have been apart of r/nofap for a short while. S/o to those guys and gals. They are truly amazing. I am currently on a 5-day streak, which has been my longest streak in a while. The sexual thoughts and urges are hard to deal with, but I know they can only last so long and as long as I'm aware that my thoughts are not my own, I will keep this streak forever. I remember quitting PMO some years ago and the guy that I was felt unstoppable. However, at the same time, I wasn't smoking weed. I remember asking a close friend a few years ago, that if I smoke weed, to please help me not make it a habit. Yet, that's exactly what happened. I now smoke weed every day and some days all day every day. I love weed. The way that it clears the cobwebs out of my brain, increases my creativity, helps me focus, and reduces my anxiety, are such amazing benefits. I have Asperger's syndrome, so I love the way that it helps me communicate socially. However, I am constantly relying on it EVERY DAY. I feel like I can't do anything without smoking beforehand. Nowadays, I feel extremely bored and overwhelmed without it and I feel like my memory is going to shit. This has to change. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't really know how to talk about my lying. I know it started after I was sexually molested. My parents told me that during that time, I was angry all the time and started lying. I remember my dad telling me that I could convince someone my shirt was red when I was standing right in front of them wearing a blue shirt. I would just make shit up. Idk why I lie still. I constantly try not to lie, but in moments of pressure and anxiety, carelessness, or feeling out of my head, I slip. Sometimes I correct myself, but sometimes I'm too ashamed and embarrassed to correct the lie and then feel a pit of shame sink in. This creates a negative feedback loop in my head. \"I'm never going to change, I'm never going to be good enough, etc.\" This needs to change.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo explain this next part, I'd like to walk you through an average day where I feel I am abusing technology. I would wake up around 5:30 am and the first thing I do is go to the bathroom. I sit on the toilet scrolling through Reddit or watching Sports Center on Snapchat. After that, I start to watch an abundance of YouTube videos while I cook and then eat. Some videos are news based like PhillyD, but most are nonsense. Sometimes, I recognize that I don't want to watch any more videos, but I can't move from my fucking seat unless I start another video. It's like I can't function unless something is playing. Then, I will wash dishes and start getting ready for work, but not without either starting another video or starting a podcast. I love to learn and podcasts are great for that. The podcasts I listen to are The JRE, Mindvalley, Mind Pump, Making Sense, Ari Shaffir's Skeptic Tank, Aubrey Marcus Podcast, RadioLab, The Fundamentalist, Philosophize This, The Valleycast, and Dynamic Banter. All great podscasts. Some more informative than others. However, as a construction contractor, I work a lot of projects. During these projects, if I'm by myself,  I will listen to these podcasts all day long (6-10 hrs). Usually, until I feel so overstimulated that I need to shut everything off. By that time, I feel like I am drunk on overstimulation of information or sense overload. I need to change this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for the negative thoughts, I have always been hard on myself. My girlfriend, my mom, and my dad are constantly telling me that I am way too hard on myself. Yet I haven't changed. I know that my true/higher self wants to grow away from this, but I haven't figured it out yet. I constantly feel not good enough and constantly have to remind myself that I'm only 26. Within my construction business, I am so scared to fail because I don't think  I have the knowledge or experience to do anything right. I feel like I'm too dumb and make too many dumb mistakes to be successful. My dad says it's normal to be fearful of these things and that most people figure it out as they go, but I feel like it is not that black and white. I am such a scared and emotional human being. Most people say I seem really confident because that's what I put out. Really, I feel like an overly anxious fraud. I need to change this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow... I know that I truly am not those things. I know that I truly am the person I want to be, I just haven't gotten there yet. The higher self version of me knows I am extremely kind, caring, and patient. I am intelligent and quick-witted. I am very hard working and customer orientated. I try to keep the mentality that if something is hard, it can only last for so long. I know that if I feel fear, I just have to overcome. I am constantly working on myself and always will. I recently wrote out a daily routine to change my life and I just finished my first week. It's based on the book called the 5 am Club. On MWF, I wake up at 4:30 am. I stretch for 20 minutes, meditate for 20 minutes, and then journal for 20 minutes. After getting dressed, I make breakfast and eat. I then learn/practice Spanish on Duolingo for 15 minutes. Then I get on with my work day. On T/TH, I wake up at 4:30 am and go to the gym. Depending on how tired I am, I either sit in the sauna or do a workout. Saturdays, I wake up at 5 am and do a heavy workout followed by the sauna or stretching. Sundays, I am up at 5 am to do another heavy workout followed by a yoga class. At night, I shower and get ready around 7:30 pm. I try to be in bed by 8:30 pm to talk with my girlfriend about our days and study my Spanish or read for 30 minutes before falling asleep at around 9:30. I am changing. Slowly, but surely I am the person I know I can be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you to those who read my post. Even as I write this, I feel like it was very helpful. I really needed to get these things out of my head. If anyone has any advice or book recommendations, I would love the feedback.",

I\u2019d get roasted hard and homies would look at me differently if they knew how bad it was. Im very low key and mostly use by myself without people knowing and go on random binges.

I\u2019ve raided my neighbours house and I often spend money on cough syrup and that sort of nonsense.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the sort of person I want to be at all, it\u2019s my biggest flaw and I think I need to address it to my family as I feel really really awful about taking it from behind their back.\n\nI really struggle opening up to my parents, I pretty much don\u2019t think I ever have before, any suggestions on how I might go about this?\nWondering if anyone\u2019s been in a similar situation before.\n\nThanks heaps in advance for the help!\n\nTl;dr",

            "selftext": "Throw away account as I\u2019m genuinely frightened, but am in desperate need of sound advice. My husband and I have  both been using meth daily for the last 2-3 years. We were functioning ok for a long time but within the last few months our lives have predictably started to fall apart. My husband\u2019s been using for quite a bit longer than I have (he introduced me to it after I discovered that he was using behind my back- I\u2019m a fucking idiot, I know.) and is arguably more heavily addicted than I am. He\u2019s developed a whole network of shady \u201cfriends\u201d through his drug use and is the one who always goes out and scores it for us. He lost his job a few months ago and is still unemployed which is terrible enough on its own, but with all the extra time on his hands the situation has only escalated. We got into a huge fight tonight after he rear ended someone while driving my car and I finally reached my breaking point. I told him I was quitting cold turkey and that he was either with me or could leave tomorrow, and I fully intend on sticking to my guns.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing- I\u2019m not naive enough to think that we can do this without a lot of support. I know that it will be excruciatingly hard  and that I should get us both into counseling and meetings ASAP if we\u2019re to have any chance of success.  I\u2019m wondering if there are any recovering addicts out there who were also parents of young children at the time they first began accessing treatment, and if so if they have any advice to offer me on protecting custody of my 4 year old daughter. I\u2019m terrified that a therapist or addiction counselor will hear our story and immediately call cps, even if we aren\u2019t using anymore . Has anyone experienced something like this? What was the outcome? What rights do we have and are there certain things we should be careful to say/not say? She is by all appearances happy and healthy and her grandmother (who does not do any drugs) lives with us in our home.",

            "selftext": "This is it. The last straw has been broken. Ironically, less than 48 hours before my boyfriend finally begins treatment. He panicked when he realized he'd be saying goodbye to his drug. \n\n I have been fighting and failing miserably to help him stay clean for the past two and a half years. I am so tired of fighting. A level of exhaustion and hurt that I could never dream existed. \n\nWe have a couple of weeks of happiness here and there. Yet, after a while the all too familiar scene replays, just as it has over and over. Each time I hope things will be different, but the only lasting changes are to my abilities to trust, feel happiness, and love. \n\n It's been a great few days. He's extra affectionate and chatty today. He seems happy, albeit a little  tired. Dare I sneak a peak at his eyes? The sinking feeling in my stomach returns. I know what I'll find, but I'd rather hold onto these \"happy\" moments for just a little while longer. I know he will deny it. I know I will yell and cry. I've had a long day at work, and I'd rather simply feel loved. I'd better not risk it unless I have the proof to show him that I'm not buying it this time. Truth be told, I've never truly bought it. I just can't bear to face the reality of the situation because I'm not ready to walk away. \n\nI have a shred of self respect and the energy to fight today so I gather my evidence. I confront him and he denies it. I share what I've found. I now get half of the story. I lay out the rest of my findings. The plot thickens. He knows he's cornered, so he confesses. He couldn't deal with the stress. The stress of work. The stress of my distrust. The stress of his family. The stress of the effects of the abortion I had because I couldn't bear to raise a child whose father may end up dead within the year.\n\nSo I \"believe\" that he's just as tired of this as I am. He will get help. He'll make an appointment, first thing. Except he's not ready to say goodbye to the drug, and we both know that, deep down. \n\nBut I am. I will say goodbye to this drug, this hurt. I will say goodbye to the anxiety, the lies I tell friends and family. The feelings of guilt and shame and self loathing I feel when I yell and ask him if it's worth it.  Because this is not my fight. Today I fight for myself and walk away.",

Better hope you don\u2019t run into your using ex-boyfriend; you might get \u2018triggered.\u2019 Change the channel if \u201cTraining Day\u201d is on TV; watching Snoop Dogg puke up a bunch of crack rocks might \u2018trigger\u2019 you:\n\n&gt; \u201cThat\u2019s right, Jimmy Crack Corn. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...oh, you\u2019re federally fucked now.\u201d \n\nAbove all, make sure you\u2019re not Hungry, Angry, Lonely or Tired, because apparently \n\n&gt; Each one of these four physical or emotional conditions, if not taken care of, leaves an individual [vulnerable for relapse.](https://healthypsych.com/h-a-l-t-hungry-angry-lonely-and-tired-a-self-care-tool/)\n\n*What?*\n\nPersonally, I can\u2019t recall smoking crack because I missed breakfast. I don\u2019t think *a sandwich* would have prevented any of my relapses. When I got out of detox and bought myself some meth two weeks later, it wasn\u2019t because I was *tired.* I wasn\u2019t tired; I was very well-rested, and I walked a great distance to get that meth. \n\nWhere are they hiding the evidence of the relationship between H.A.L.T. and relapse? That\u2019s what I\u2019d like to know. Did somebody do some kind of study, where they surveyed recovering addicts about their hunger level, and then offered drugs to these underfed addicts, and based on this experiment came to the conclusion that hungry addicts are extra \u201cvulnerable for relapse\u201d? Is there any evidence that teaching addicts to be mindful of H.A.L.T. will help them stay sober? \n\nCertainly, staying sober should involve avoiding certain people &amp; places &amp; situations. I would not *advise* you to spend your Saturday night at the bar, if you\u2019re an alcoholic trying to quit. Staying sober certainly involves taking care of yourself: eating right, socializing with other people, a healthy balance of work/play. \n\nBut I have a problem with the word \u2018trigger.\u2019 I don\u2019t like the implications of this word, and neither should you, because you\u2019re not a gun; you\u2019re a human being who can make choices. When you squeeze the trigger on a gun, the gun cannot think to itself: *Well, my trigger\u2019s been pulled. Nevertheless, I decide I\u2019m not going to fire.* \n\nRelapse is nothing like a gun. Relapse doesn\u2019t have a \u2018trigger\u2019 that gets pulled as soon as you find a forgotten stash of drugs, or drive past the liquor store, or cross paths with your old friend who still loves to party. These events may \u2018trigger\u2019 the *want* to relapse, but **relapse itself cannot be triggered** by anything or anybody except for yourself. \n\nI have discovered that belief in \u2018triggers\u2019 is not conducive to sobriety. To stay sober, you need to be *resilient.* You should be able to handle seeing drugs on TV. You\u2019re not a 4-year-old; just because you saw something on TV doesn\u2019t mean you have to do it in real life. You should be able to handle drinking water at the restaurant while your wife orders a glass of wine. You should be able to say \u201cno thanks\u201d to an old friend who wants to party with you. \n\nIf your goal is to stay sober, it\u2019s wise to avoid putting yourself in situations where you\u2019ll *want* to relapse. Take care of yourself, physically and emotionally. But never forget that you can make the choice to stay sober under any &amp; all circumstances.",

            "selftext": " \n\nThis post is a little long, and a little bit graphic and depressing but I found very necessary to share, so if you do not really have a good 5 min to spare or do not want to read something upsetting just keep on scrolling.....\n\nI just had to share this. I have never read something so powerful about drugs or addiction as the post I will be sharing.   \nI belong to a few Drug recovery groups  on facebook and reddit because I have my own ongoing battle with drug addiction. This post specifically targets heroin, a drug I have used plenty of times(never injected though) but I suppose fortunately I did not get hooked on as most do. I have however seen how low and devastating heroin addiction can be. Not to mention its practically one of the few or only drug that pretty much is the easiest to die/overdose from... which brings me to the post I am going to share. It was written by a funeral director in anywhere USA, whose name I will omit from the post for anonymity reasons. It is as follows:\n\nFuck Heroin. FUCK. IT.\n\nThat\u2019s what I want to say when I get a phone call from a crying son, daughter, husband, wife, girlfriend, or boyfriend telling me their loved one has died from an overdose. But I don\u2019t say that. I don\u2019t say it because it\u2019s impolite and I\u2019m supposed to be the even minded professional to your grief clouded bereavement.\n\nBut, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss\u201d and \u201cmy deepest condolences\u201d just don\u2019t work when a 19-year-old daughter was found in the basement of her friend\u2019s house after two stints in rehab and five months clean. This was supposed to be the beginning of her life, not the horrible end.\n\nOr, what do I say to the sixteen-year-old son who wants me to call him as soon as I get his mom to the funeral home because \u201cthat will be the first time in my life that I\u2019ll know exactly where she\u2019s at\u201d.\n\nOr, what do I say to the 30-year-old wife with three kids and no income, little support and now she has no husband.\n\nFuck it. FUCK HEROIN. That\u2019s what I want to say.\n\nHow about the parents who tell me, \u201cI\u2019m glad it\u2019s over. I haven\u2019t slept in years, but last night I actually slept because I knew he wasn\u2019t out hurting himself or someone else.\u201d\n\nOr the parents who tell me with blank expressions that they had absolutely no idea their daughter was using. That she was excelling in college, holding a steady relationship with her boyfriend, working part-time and now she\u2019s on our morgue table.\n\nWhat do I say to the young husband who tells me, \u201cWe don\u2019t have any money for a funeral, she blew all our savings and her life on this relapse.\u201d\n\nHow do I respond when that very same young husband follows it up with, \u201chow do I explain this to my kids?\u201d\n\nAnd then there are the times when the body has been left somewhere, abandoned by so called friends, and it\u2019s starting to decompose. \u201cCan I just see my dad one more time?\u201d the young man asks. \u201cYes, you can,\u201d I say, \u201cbut this doesn\u2019t look like the man you expect to see.\u201d The son replies, \u201cThat\u2019s fine. I haven\u2019t seen him in five years so I don\u2019t have any expectations.\u201d\n\nFUCK HEROIN. I\u2019m getting tired of these stories. I\u2019m tired of unstitching and embalming autopsied bodies that are discolored and broken down by addiction. I\u2019m tired of hearing the empty cries of \u201cMy, baby, my baby! How did this happen?\u201d How did we get here?\u201d when the mother sees her son in a casket. I\u2019m tired of children asking, \u201cwhat happened to mommy?\u201d and \u201cwhen will she wake up?\u201d at funerals.\n\nI\u2019m getting tired of these stories. I know addiction is a disease. I understand that shame is never the path to healing. There\u2019s no shame here towards the addict. The enemy is very clear. We can all agree that this particular disease, this particular addiction is worthy of our most harsh, most striking, most caustic curse words we can find.\n\nFor all the fatherless and motherless children I\u2019ve served \u2026\n\nFor all the widows and widowers I\u2019ve walked with through the valley \u2026\n\nFor all the bereaved parents now childless \u2026\n\nFor all the individual lives you\u2019ve stolen, all the futures you\u2019ve killed, and all the love you\u2019ve grieved \u2026\n\nI raise my middle finger to you, heroin.\n\nFuck you.   \n\n\nSincerely,  \nMr. Funeral Director",

            "selftext": "So the backstory... \n\nMy wife and started taking Kratom about 8 years ago. It started out with the capsules you could buy at smoke shops and literally was only used for the \u201cnumbing\u201d effect at relatively higher doses. (We would sometimes do this in lieu of buying a 12 pack of beer per say... potentially even in addition too) \n\nWell, it graduated to using the measuring cups for medicine (like, from a cough syrup).. dosage creep went from maybe 5mL, every 3-4 hours (regardless of strain - that stopped, mattering) to 10mL at the same frequency. \n\nWe\u2019ve off and on discussed \u201cquitting\u201d because we get 0 effect from it now... we take it NOW because if we don\u2019t, we begin the \u201copioid\u201d withdrawals. (Which for me is low appetite, hard to sleep, RLS, eyes watering, and a general feeling of tired or like I can never get 100% energy) I know it doesn\u2019t sound all that bad.. and I almost feel bad explaining/typing this cause I\u2019m considering folks with much worse addictions and I feel like a \u201cbitch\u201d...\n\nAnyway.. I\u2019m looking for suggestions, methods, anything that could help in loosening this noose and quitting. \n\nI can\u2019t go to rehab.. let\u2019s just put out there now. I have kids.. I have a job.. and I don\u2019t have the finances to take weeks off to fix this, it\u2019ll have to be done on the fly with work sometimes being in there.. I\u2019ve begun tracking doses marking amount and time.  Currently I\u2019ve throttled back to 2.0mL per day and trying to reduce that by .5 against the average of the week.\n\nThis has been going on for 2 weeks now and it\u2019s hard to believe that even with this reduction I am going to \u201cwin\u201d... any help or suggestions would be appreciated...",

I tell myself it's what gets me thru the day. I work a boring office job.\n\nI have some in the morning and then again around lunch time. Without it I'm just tired and miserable. But I am trying to get healthy this summer bc I want to get pregnant in a few months. I party too much, and I think the adderall is all part of the mix. It lets me cheat myself out of sleep by staying up too late, because it can give me artificial energy the next day. I also am accustomed to that upper high all day every day.\n\nAnyway, I'm making a personal commitment to changing. I want to be free of all hard drugs all summer, and I think for me that needs to include adderall. Thanks to anyone for listening.",

Being a plug its hard not to be around coke and other people using it and I can\u2019t stop shoveling it up my nose despite being on probation for almost a year now. I\u2019m in a court mandated drug rehab group twice a week and I\u2019m set to graduate and possibly get off probation early. Despite the risk of failing a UA and getting a 3 month sentence I continue to use massive amounts of blow. I need help guys. I need advice for getting clean from blow or at least cutting back.

His motor function skills are bad and he has a hard time controlling his bladder &amp; bowels. He also lost a good portion of his hearing on his right ear. He's not going to survive another OD. I know he won't make it past 30. In a way he kinda died a long time ago. He's not the same person he used to be. I think my mom is just trying to keep him alive the only way she knows how. Even my mom is not the same person she used to be. She's aged about 20 years in the span of 5 years and I think when he goes she'll end up going with him. For now I'm just waiting for the day we get that call and then our family will truly never be the same again. He'll have finished the job. It's my birthday today. My birthday wish is that he could kick that garbage and be healthy again. Sorry about whatever this was I just needed it to come out.",

            "selftext": "For many years, I viewed my Addiction as powerful &amp; authoritative. I lived in constant anxiety, worrying about when would the next time my Addiction would demand drugs.  As a powerless Addict, I cannot reasonably expect myself to be able to resist my Addiction. All of the so-called \u2018experts\u2019 in addiction encouraged me to believe that I am powerless over my Addictive Voice, and so that is what I firmly believed. \u201cJust say no?\u201d *Impossible,* I thought. *Maybe YOU can just say no...but as for me, I\u2019m an Addict, and Addicts cannot simply say \u2018no\u2019 to their Addiction.*\n\nSo, as an Addict exiting rehab, I had to worry: When\u2019s the next time my Addiction is going to start acting up? What will it make me do? What will it make me lose? Life is very stressful when you\u2019re a powerless Addict whose destiny is to serve his big, bad Addiction whatever/whenever it wants. \n\n\u201cTake what you can &amp; leave the rest,\u201d is what you\u2019re told at Twelve Step Meetings, when you express your inability to believe in the existence of any \u2018Higher Power\u2019 that wants to help Addicts improve themselves and stay sober. So that\u2019s what I did.\n\nThere is a small, dedicated \u2018core\u2019 at any Twelve Step Meeting: At a Meeting of 30 people, I\u2019d see perhaps 3 or 4 people who consistently attend &amp; chair the Meetings, who strongly believe in the effectiveness of the Program. These \u2018core\u2019 people have been sober for many years/decades. Outside of this \u2018core,\u2019 there are the strugglers. These are the people who attend somewhat sporadically: Come for a few weeks, stop coming, come back for a few months, etc. These are the people accepting keychains for \u201c24 Hours Clean &amp; Serene.\u201d \n\nI remember what it was like, when they were calling out the keychains:\n\n\u201cTwo weeks?\u201d\n\n*One person takes 2-week keychain. Everyone claps.*\n\n\u201cSix weeks?\u201d\n\n*Keep coming back.*\n\n\u201cOne month?\u201d\n\n*Keep coming back.*\n\n...\n\n\u201cOne year?\u201d\n\n*Keep coming back.*\n\n\u201cTwo years?\u201d\n\n*Keep coming back.*\n\nWitnessing them hand out the keychains week after week, I noticed *many* people accepting the \u2018small time\u2019 keychains &amp; *extremely few*  accepting the \u2018big time\u2019 keychains. And it wasn\u2019t because there were just so many new attendees, just starting with the Twelve Steps; it was because the vast majority of attendees were unable to stay sober for 1 or 2 years. *Many relapse,* very few stay sober in this \u201cspiritual, not religious\u201d program. Seeing this firsthand, my confidence in the Twelve Steps began to shatter. \n\nAt Twelve Step Meetings, the **power** of Addiction is emphasized and the **powerlessness** of the Addict is emphasized to an even greater degree. If there is a \u2018Higher Power\u2019 empowering Addicts to stay sober, what\u2019s with all the white keychains? Is the \u2018Higher Power\u2019 so inept?\n\nThe usual response is that when 80-90% of people in our program relapse, it\u2019s *their* fault. They should have worked the Steps *more thoroughly* with their Sponsor! They should keep coming back and do a *more thorough* moral inventory. In rehab, I met a woman who told me she was working on her *third or fourth* moral inventory. What is the definition of insanity? If your first three \u2018moral inventories\u2019 didn\u2019t help, why are you doing another one? Here you are, *in rehab again,* and you\u2019ve been \u201cworking the steps\u201d with sponsors for ages. Again, what is the definition of insanity?\n\nI got sober without the Twelve Steps by recognizing that what this program teaches you to believe about addiction isn\u2019t true. The truth is: \n\n**Your Addiction is powerless over YOU.**\n\nYour Addiction is *sly,* and *sneaky,* and *shrewd,* and those kinds of things...But it is NOT powerful. It is weak. It\u2019s sneaky enough to trick you into *thinking* it\u2019s powerful, that it has the ability to control you. \n\nAddiction is a sneaky little bitch that just wants \u2018food.\u2019 You are the only one who can give the addiction \u2018food.\u2019 This sneaky little bitch will try to brainwash you into thinking you have to obey its commands and feed it whatever kind of \u2018food\u2019 it wants. But the truth is that your Addiction cannot make you do *anything.*\n\n**YOU** have power over your own body &amp; brain. Stick out your tongue. Wiggle your fingers. Think about grapefruit. You *actually* have the power to control what you think &amp; what you do with your physical body. \n\nYour Addiction has the power to *talk to you.* It has the power to *ask for your stuff.* It might try to *order you around,* but are you going to let this little bitch tell you what to do? This is **your** body.",

Insomnia has plagued me on and off (mostly ON) all my adult life.  Without it I would be up till midnight or 2 am several days a week staring at the ceiling unable to sleep. That doesn't make for very good quality sleep since I have to get up at 4am for work.  I never gave it much thought, after all, it's sold OTC and can't be that bad.  Right? It's cheap and it works. Had the bonus of cutting the nagging cough I've had for years too. A single doe and I'd be asleep within the hour most nights. \n\nMy last medical checkup showed all was fine - except for my blood pressure.  It was high, not alarmingly high but enough to warrant a prescription drug.  All the high BP drugs I tried years ago when it was high made me almost instantly sick to my stomach, so I wanted to avoid that route.  That time years ago I lost a bunch of weight and that did the trick and took my BP down. \n\nOne thing I didn't know was that the active ingredient in Nyquil is dextromethorphan - and that can cause high blood pressure.  After my last checkup and the warning about my BP being high I thought 'No, problem, I'll just stop using it'.  Well, kicking this stuff leads to insomnia - real bad insomnia, like NO sleep at all for days insomnia. \n\nI stopped cold turkey on the first day of a 9 day vacation.  It took 7 days to get more than 2 hours of sleep a night.  That 9 day vacation was the longest vacation I've ever experience, I've had 3 week vacations before, but this one SEEMED to last far longer. The days just drug on and on. I felt like I was going to lose my mind from lack of sleep. Here it is 16 days later and I'm still having issues getting to sleep, but it's getting easier. \n\nI guess I'm posting just to advise other's to watch out, just becasue a drug is OTC doesn't mean you can't get hooked on it.  And getting off the stuff may not be as bad as hard drugs, it can still make your life a living hell. \n\nI feel much better now.  I hadn't realized it but I was experiencing a bad mental and emotional haze. That seems to have lifted, despite still being a bit sleep deprived. \n\nSo, congrats on all you that have kicked your demon, and best wishes to those who have yet to conquer it - keep trying, it's worth it in the long run.",

            "selftext": "I'm in my mid20s now. Been trying to scratch at the breadth, depth, and origins of my addiction. From 16-22 it was every drug I could get my hands on. More recently I've started to realize it extends to gaming and tv as well which was ever since I can remember, ofc it got worse as I got older. I live with my mom as I'm finishing school and getting ready to get my career and move out, but trying to minimize loan debt. Live in a shitty city in a shitty state. All my friends move away, but I'm an only child. Hard for me to consider leaving my mother behind, because all she really has is me. I get irritated with her and annoyed by her chatting at me about people I don't know and shit. She's tried to tell me before that it hurts her feelings and I guess I wasn't really listening. My mom gave up everything for me and did everything she could for me, including staying in abusive marriages. Ofc hindsight is 2020, but you make the best decisions you can yknow? Her mom was a terrible alcoholic, and her dad (who divorced her mom) wouldn't ever acknowledge it, because then it would be his problem. It was really bad on her, she married my dad to get away from it. He and later stepdad were cruel to her, physically but emotionally really. \n\nShe takes me getting annoyed personally, but I've tried to tell her it was because it's hard to be grown and live with your parent and not move out as soon as you'd like. But as I think about it now, it's because she interferes with my addiction. I had to face her fear and sorrow when it was drugs. Now I realize how cold and calloused I've been when it's games and tv she's interfering with. She just wants to tell me about her fucking day or just to be able to talk to me about something. She even tries with shit she knows I like. I can't imagine having your parents choose alcohol over you, having your spouses beat and abuse you, and then, this fucking kid who you've sacrificed it all for, this piece of fucking shit, barely look at you when you come home.\n\nI don't know. It's not personal, I'm just trying to medicate myself. I'm just trying to make it through. I hurt constantly, I try to improve things, I even quit drugs that I so loved more than so much else in life. But that wasn't enough. I just try to fill the gaping fucking hole where some community and some purpose should be. Even when I was so fucked up I couldn't even assemble the building blocks of a single thought, that guilt was there. I never really knew what it was. Now I do I guess. It's like a whole new level of selfhate. If you told me this story with anyone else taking my role, I'd hate them too. To just fucking ignore someone who gave everything for them. Even if I fix it, even if I do better, it's so many fucking years of her having to suffer such a deep fucking rejection from her only child. I can't fix it. I can't fix any of this.",

            "selftext": "My brother had been on a plateau for about a year now. He wasn't working or moving out, but at least he wasn't using. He also escaped all of his legal troubles. He just got out of a one-month rehab to get off Methadone.\n\nAs his living situation changed (family member got really sick, please think of him) we got him into an Oxford House. That lasted about three days. Now he's went back into the wild.\n\nIt just really hurts. I'm in college and I can't help him in any way because of family conflicts (he's technically my half-brother, and that alone pisses off my dad) I wish that I none of this was real, that I could be totally unaware of NA, Erowid, and Oxford Houses. I wish he had never taken my medicine. I wish he had never used me. It feels like, rather, I know it has been me, the younger brother, taking care of the older brother with the mind of a child. He will sit still for a while, but turn my back for a second and he's into something. \n\nI don't feel like any of this is my fault, but it does feel like I'm watching a freight train hit a Smart Car. I don't know if there's anything I can do. If I try and push him, he blames others (that also help him out) for this. If I try and be his friend, he uses me to go and get drugs. If I give him real leads on jobs or even stuff for our hobbies (guitars, electronics, games) he just forgets it when I leave.\n\nI don't want to feel like this anymore. I don't want to feel guilty for not helping him, but I don't want to end up taking him plus four other people to NA meetings. I don't want to pick them up from said meeting and take them to \"their friend\"'s house. It's such a vicious cycle that has robbed me of so much. So many high school dates, so much homework, so much personal time I've spent trying to comfort him. I don't want to carry his casket too.",

            "selftext": "This is kind of a long post, but I need to get this out. \nSo I was a meth addict from the age of 15 to 19. Ruined my life. I never graduated high school, I was homeless/living with my bestfriend at the time who was the one who first introduced me to meth, so we always smoked. Day and night. Everyday. I lost all my weight because I never ate, and I was suffering terrible psychosis very often from smoking all the time and getting no sleep, always hallucinating auditory and visually and it was BAD. I was out of my mind for sure. I have borderline personality disorder, so I'm just naturally an emotional trainwreck. I was in and out of jail. But then I got clean. I moved back home. I was doing so well and I never thought I would EVER go back to using. I've always been pretty open about my addiction and recovery. I just turned 24 and was coming up on 5 years meth free. Late last year I had a dream that I was using, and ever since then, I couldn't shake the cravings away. I had a few more dreams since then that I was using through out the months, and the cravings just never went away. I ended up breaking and I bought some. I bought a $20 bag. Its day 8 now of using, I'm portioning out that bag. My husband works mornings and is off a few days and he knows of my past addiction and him and all my family and friends would be heartbroken and I just don't want to deal with what's to come if I come forward and admit it, especially because I feel like it's not worth putting them through all that sadness and then they'll start not trusting me and I just don't see it doing any good. I smoke when my husband is at work in the mornings, and sometimes when he's home I'll go to the bathroom and smoke a bit more just to keep the feeling going. I think this may be not such a good batch, because I am able to control myself pretty well on it. I dont get super talkative and I dont jerk and twitch like I used to. Maybe I'm not taking enough, but I dont want to over do it since I haven't done it in so long and dont know what my body can take. At night i take my sleeping pill to fall asleep so i sleep everyday, and I also make sure to eat, drink water and shower, brush my teeth and wash my face. I have lost about 5 pounds because I'm not eating like I usually do, just about a full meal a day. I was a super bad picker back then, and that's the only thing that I seem to be having a bit of a hard time controlling, I pick at my fingers a lot and can get lost in it so I have to work to snap out of it. There have been moments where I am starting to pick at my face, and i VERY quickly force myself to stop because if I start having obvious marks on my face it will be so noticeable, and also I just dont want to ruin my skin. I know how bad I got back then when I was 15-19, so now I feel like I know what to do to use and not have anyone be suspicious of me being high. Its bothering me a bit because I don't feel like I'm even really getting very high, but my hands and feet get freezing at moments, my body temperature gets really hot sometimes, but the weird part is I'm not super energized like I should be. I can lay down and scroll my phone for hours, I used to get stuck drawing or writing and talking for ever but I don't feel that. Again, could be the batch isn't very clean or whatever. That's okay. I still get the feeling I guess I was craving, and I find myself always wanting more very quickly after I smoke, like... 30 mins to an hour I always want another hit but I make myself wait so I'm not constantly going to the bathroom to smoke and have someone suspicious as to why I suddenly am going to the bathroom so much AND locking the door while I'm in there, which I never do. Right now I still have some left in the baggie, and I'm really not sure if I'm going to get more once I'm done. I obviously don't want to be in active addiction for ever, but my mind is sort of doing this thing where I tell myself that I can use here and there since I'm eating/sleeping and taking care of myself this time, and no one even notices that I've been using for the last 8 days. I know it's the addict in me, but I am just pretty stuck. I always make it a huge deal when I hit another year meth free, and when this next one comes up in just a couple months, I know everyone will expect me to celebrate my \"5th birthday\". I'm stuck between continuing to use here and there and not telling anyone, and still celebrating 5 years, or confessing that I've used, or just not mention it this time and not say anything. Just kind of stop and never tell anyone about this relapse. I would feel guilty celebrating something I didn't earn, but I'll also be feeling terrible and guilty if I confessed. I'm leaning towards not saying anything. I dont know what to do, if I'll be able to stop, or if I'm just going to keep using. Even if no one is reading this, I really needed to get this off of my chest... and if you're reading this, I could use some words of advice/encouragement/feedback... something, I don't know. Thanks for letting me vent about this.",

            "selftext": "Small backstory. I\u2019m a senior in high school and about 2 miles away from school theres this 7-11 that I\u2019ve been stealing from for months now. Me and 2 other friends get baked every Friday afternoon since we all finish classes around 1pm, and start smoking weed. So around 1:45 we get extremely hungry but never pay since we can get away with stealing so easily. It all started back in March, when I read a guide online on how to shoplift. I started off stealing small packs of gum, and maybe 1 bottle of pop. I\u2019ve gotten wayyy too cocky over time and started stealing more, ever since then, I\u2019ve been taking my empty backpack into 7-11 and stealing about 3 bottles of pop, 3-4 bags of chips, and some chocolate bars. Everytime I walk into a store, I have the urge to steal, and usually walk out with something. I have now stolen about $700 worth of stuff from different stores in the span of 3 months including wireless headphones, chargers, designer cologne, a pipe to smoke out of, bluetooth speakers, and blu ray discs. The cashier @ 7-11 never sees me steal anything because I crouch behind the furthest aisle then shove everything into my bag. I walk out of the store with a huge adrenaline rush of-course, and feel great, sadly. Me and my friends drive off with whatever food we were craving that day. I told myself I would stop when I finally got caught, because I knew eventually it would happen. Last week is when it happened, I was in the middle of putting 3 bottles of Mountain Dew into my backpack when I locked eyes with an employee. For some stupid reason I decided to ask her \u201cHow much are these bottles of pop?\u201d, she replied and said the price is on the shelf (duh), she then walked behind the cashier, and told him. The manager wasn\u2019t there for some reason, when he usually is, but I still decided to walk out with the pop like a dumb fuck and nothing happened since. My friend drove the fuck out of there. I don\u2019t think the employees gave a fuck since they all make minimum wage, but had the manager been there, I probably would\u2019ve been in serious trouble. \n\nI need serious help. I think that I am seriously addicted because I never get caught and do it so smoothly, so I want more and more, and that\u2019s how I worked up stealing stuff worth more and more. I could get a criminal charge, and probably fined heavily, and my parents would kick my ass. If I don\u2019t stop now, I\u2019ll be doing this until I get caught and booked. I want to stop, me and my friends all work jobs so obviously we can afford to buy this stuff, but we all feel such a thrill from stealing. How do I stop for good?",

I did it for about 5 years. I wasnt doing it constantly for all of those years but the last few I definitely was. (I'm not going to get into my use unless someone wants to know) Honestly it was pretty easy to quit it, which was kind of weird. But then pretty soon I fell into alcohol. Now I already drank before but not to this extent. I usually pick up a 2 6 every second day. It's so much harder to quit liquor though.. For me anyways. I don't know why either. I ever tell myself I'm an alcoholic and an idiot. Like I know what I'm doing is bad but it's so hard to stop. It was easy to quit meth but not liquor wtf. A legal thing.

            "selftext": "I am 21 and I've been on suboxone for almost 3 years now, started at 8mg/day, and am down to 2mg/day, 1mg in the morning and 1 at night\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like I have made almost no progress in these three years, the first year I laid in bed 24/7 jobless, no motivation to do anything at all, I would just take my suboxone with a couple benedryl to try and trick my mind into feeling like I was sedated and feeling good, and that was my entire life for year 1. My life goal was \"don't shoot dope so my parents can be at peace. As long as I'm not doing that, it doesn't matter, as long as I'm not doing that.....\" I was coming off of being voluntarily homeless and in and out of rehab for heroin, I was officially out of options and asked my parents to help me get on suboxone, so they did. So I was able to get through the days without having to get opiates to avoid withdrawal. Suboxone made it so I had a choice again, and I chose to not use dope for my parents sake, because the only thing that makes my life worth living is the life of a junkie, so I accepted that I would give up my life for them, they do not deserve to go through what I put them through, to put it lightly. I should mention that I have better support from my parents than I assume 95% of all addicts do, I am incredibly lucky and feel so bad that things are the way they are. But on the surface things seem good, it seems to them like I have made so much progress and am doing well, but in my head, I basically feel like I'm lying to them and just acting like I think they'd want, I just want them to be happy and not be upset at who their son is because they don't fuckin deserve it\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYear 2, my parents helped me get a job, a 5 minute ride away, this was important because I had no car because I totaled it in 2016 after ditching rehab to go cop, I smashed a parked car 2 mins away from my house on the way back from copping. So they drove my ass to and from work every fucking shift for like 6 months, I didn't even care to get a car again, what good could come from that? It would just be temptation. I slowly started to feel even more bad for my parents, their son is this lifeless bundle of bones who clearly hates life, they had to do everything for me, like I was disabled.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I started to realize that this lifestyle is just as unfair to them as me actively using, I slowly started to \"want\" to get better. I started telling myself that I need to do this for ME, not them, because I understood that you need to do it for yourself or it's just not gonna work, but I didn't have it in me to do it. Baby steps, I eventually had been away from the drugs long enough to be able to get a car and not instantly go get drugs, and I started  trying to do things for me, instead of them, while also still understanding that the main reason I don't go and get high is still for their sake. But I told myself that slowly but surely this will shift into me doing it for me, as long as I keep doing the right thing good things will happen\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI fucking hate being on suboxone, it was a necessary evil, it gave me the ability to have a choice. But now, 3 years later, it just feels like chains n shackles around my ankles. I still dread waking up every single day, putting this disgusting shit under my tongue, can't talk or swallow, and hold it there for 20-30mins to ensure I absorb as much as possible, yet I always feel like shit, I lack energy and motivation, I blame everything in life on this drug. On my days off I often find myself unable to get out of bed until like 1-4pm, I just lay there scrolling reddit and shit, just 0 motivation for life when no one is watching. I feel like once i'm off it this switch will flip in my brain and I will be normal, I will have more energy and be happier, I won't have to live in chains and be forced to take this shit twice every day to avoid withdrawal. I think lots of people hit this point in sub maintenance, you understand that it fulfilled it's purpose but now it's time to get off it and move on. I've dropped 6mg total so far, and have felt awful the entire time. I just wanna feel normal. I don't know how I'm gonna do these last 2mg, but I'm gonna take at least a month off to avoid total loss of sanity, and hope that I will \"even out\" and feel somewhat normal if I stop fucking with my dose. But I've felt more or less the same ever since I got on subs, just a little worse when tapering. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy problem is that deep down, I believe I am the same I was 3 years ago. I feel like my life is a lie, it's all a show, what goes on in my head vs what I say and put out in the world are two very different things. I have even fucked up in the past few months and took a couple 30's on a handful of different occasions, all alone of course, and since I'm on subs I didn't get the full effect, but enough to bring me back to feeling \"normal.\" I've clearly fucked up here, by reminding myself that opiates make me feel okay, no anxiety, to the point where it made me realize how anxious I truly am 24/7. I wasn't even nodding off or anything, I'd puke myself sober before oxy got me to that point, yet I still felt so good. That's how life is supposed to feel.. that's how normal people feel all the time, is what I think I believe, well maybe not that good, but normal people definitely don't feel as awful as I do all the time, or I'm just a huge pussy, idk. I refuse to believe that the way I feel now is how normal people feel, because if this is how everyone feels, there's no way any progress could be made in this world, which brings me back to me saying that \"once I'm off the subs a switch will flip and I will feel content and okay in my own skin.\" I know that's just me dreaming, but I really do wonder how I'll feel once I'm finally off this shit, I truly hope I'll feel okay. I started using drugs so early that I don't actually know what \"normal\" is, I never experienced it. At 13 I realized what drugs can do, how they make you feel, and that became what my life was about, feeling drugs, because it was funner than normal life. I know that sounds crazy because I say my parents are great, but they truly are, they gave me everything and more, materialistically, and mentally, my childhood was good. I was just extraordinarily sneaky, and started it young, and got good at it quick. They just thought I was out enjoying life, having friends, but really I was just doing various drugs with various people, slowly going deeper and deeper onto the path of addiction, until I ended up a needle junkie\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone manages to read all that shit, I wouldn't be upset if no one does because it's way too fucking long, I would probably just scroll right past it myself, but if anyone does, and you see something in there that could help me understand why I feel the way I do, let me know. Maybe there's something obvious I'm missing that an external perspective can see\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat can I do to feel better? Mentally, physically, to get out of my head, to not continue living like this. I'm worried to just say all of this to my parents, because in their heads they have faith and trust in me, and I tell them I am okay and would never use drugs again, I'm over it, like it was a fuckin phase or something. They know that's not the case, but they don't know that heroin is still, to this day, in the forefront of my mind. I don't want to go back, I want to go forward, I truly want to be normal. I wish I could put myself into a coma for a month or two to detox from the subs",

Ive since stopped taking opiates for 2 1/2 months and its been nice, i dont wake up and vomit, or feel hungover, or get paranoid over the guilt, and yeah its good to be free from them, but i dont feel like myself anymore, i just feel like im missing apart of myself and the awful lows have been stronger than ever and i try so hard to fight that, but im surrounded by triggers all over the god damn place and nothing sounds better than a fix to just take everything away and i can feel \"normal\" I always have to run errands to the drug store to get my moms and brothers medications and its driving me insane, i cant risk relapsing in this point of life, i need to get my life back in general. drugs SUCK.",

I as well drink but have cut down a lot due to health reasons and just wanting to be healthier. I smoke weed maybe 1-2 times a week to help me sleep etc,. Him and his friends are into coke. His friends way more often like every week multiple nights sometimes. My bf once every 2-3 months but if he starts then he can do that a few times a week or 1-4 times a month and then he takes a break. I really don\u2019t approve of that drug because it\u2019s so terrible for your health. He doesn\u2019t do it often enough for any serious health consequences but he also mixes a shit ton of alcohol with the coke.

            "selftext": "Looking for some insight. \n\nMy bf is an addict, wasnt when we got together many years ago. He has been in recovery for the last few months (been to rehab, consistent relapsing since). \n\nWhenever he relapses he becomes a different person. His dress sense changes, he dyes his hair bright colours, wears jewellery and paints his nails and he makes music. He becomes a SoundCloud rapper, singing about being depressed, taking/selling drugs and fucking hoes. He has created a secret social media account that he thinks I don't know about, and posts photos of his drugs, and brags about his using. He is the complete opposite when sober, a normal kinda geeky guy who doesn't even use social media. \n\nDoes anyone have any idea why he does this? He has not been able to explain it to me. I find it really conflicting because I thought addicts have a lot of shame and he is supposedly in recovery, but the way he acts when he relapses is far from any shame or guilt, I would say he seems proud and thinks he's cool and tbh, doesn't even show any remorse anymore for all the lies and gaslighting me. \n\nIs it normal to change so drastically when using?What about the lack of remorse (he used to be very remorseful and apologetic, but not anymore)? Does he seem like someone in recovery (when sober he won't delete/block any of his active addict friends, won't delete his social media, doesn't attend meetings anymore, just goes to therapy)?",

            "selftext": "It is exactly 2:30 AM at the time of me writing this. I'm high on Adderall and likely will be up until I have to go to school tomorrow. Tonight, for the first time, I had a terrible experience with it. I was throwing up, my heart was beating extremely fast, and my head was pounding. Not only this, but my mom caught me. She suspected that she had been missing some previously and made sure to count tonight; she noticed that four were missing. I could tell the discovery really hurt her and she was very upset, and who knows what I'll come home from school to tomorrow. Her brother currently is in jail due to his addiction and her father died thanks to it when I was two. Addiction seems to run in my family, especially for the males. Anyway, all of this along with being pretty high on speed made me realize that I have a serious problem. I can't find my journal and there's absolutely no one to talk to, so I figured I'd write here. Fair warning, this may be pretty long. \n\nI'm about to be a senior in high school. Last October, I was a completely normal teenager. I would give just about anything to go back to just October. All of the things I long for now that I took for granted then  - close friends, good grades, freedom, and ignorance of how shitty life generally is - are gone. I feel that my situation is so trivial compared to others that I'm humiliated to talk to anyone about it.  In October, my girlfriend of three years and I broke up. This came accompanied by losing a few of my closest friends; I really had lost everyone outside of my family that I loved and cared about.  I didn't know then how dependent on not only my girlfriend but my friends I was to be happy, and if we would have stayed together I would have most likely never realized that my attachment was unhealthy. Keep in mind that this is a person who I considered my family. We talked and saw each other constantly for 3 years straight. She was literally the centerpiece of my life, and we were extremely happy together at one point. Losing her triggered already underlying depression and anxiety. It got pretty bad, and I ended up calling the suicide hotline. Because, on my call, I admitted to trying to kill myself using Ativan, police were sent to my house and they notified my parents. They chalked it up to my being over emotional and it was pretty much forgotten about. This wasn't my parents just ignoring it - I have a history of being overly emotional and throwing fits due to insignificant inconveniences.) Around this time, my uncle (who I mentioned above) came to stay. Circumstances caused by his drug addiction led him to live with my family. On December 3rd, my girlfriend decided that we should cut contact with each other and blocked me completely. I handled this terribly, and decided that I'd get high with my uncle. He and I decided to buy some bud and just chill. It wasn't my first time smoking, but I didn't have much experience with any drugs. The next day I went to school and attempted to talk to her, only to be met with rejection and pleas not to spend the day pathetically following her around school crying. I'm not sure what was so wrong with me then. I was kind of a pussy, and probably did more harm than good in getting her back. Anyway, this threw me into a complete meltdown at school. I caught the attention of one of my teachers, who brought the social worker to see me. I was so emotional that I ended up telling her about my suicidal thoughts and showing her my wrists which I had cut up the previous night. This got me a one way ticket to being admitted to the behavioral health clinic about an hour from where I live. I stayed for about a week, and over the months of December and January, I began feeling much better. There were a few times when I felt like shit, but I still would trade anything to go back to then. In February, my girlfriend and I even got back together officially (we still talked regularly over the period we weren't dating) and everything seemed to be returning to normal. In March, I decided to do some extra work to get the money to buy a battery and a cart (I'm not sure if explaining what that is here will make me sound obnoxious, but its just basically the two components used to vape THC). I was excited to get high and I remember this time period being very care-free, as things should've been. I started smoking regularly (I had already been smoking with friends a lot before I bought my own pen)\n\nMy girlfriend and I officially ended things in April and we have not talked or acknowledged each other since. No mental breakdown, no begging and pleading, just over. While I at first thought this might be a good thing that can maybe open new doors, it only spiraled downwards from this point. I am 500% that I would have reacted much differently if it wasn't for my access to weed. I counted on it to make me feel better, and it worked. Since then, I have been smoking heavily every single day. Later in April, I did acid at school and spent the entire school day tripping. It was a super good experience, but it was very dumb. I never would have done anything similar just a few months prior. It scares me how quickly things change, and it is frightening that I'm such a completely different person than I was months ago. I used to care about being popular, liked, and I wanted to seem successful to my peers. Now I don't care what anyone thinking about me outside of a few people and I spend every day on some type of drug. I can go without smoking or popping pills, but the only thing I experience when I'm sober and left alone with my thoughts is deep, overwhelming sadness and dread that life is passing me by. My teenage years are dwindling. It's completely terrifying to me how much time has passed. Looking at myself in the mirror often depresses me because I sometimes take note of how big I've gotten. I'm pretty much done growing. This body is an adult one. I, at least biologically, am an adult. I have no time left to be a child and enjoy life before I'm thrown into the workforce to slave away. I don't want to graduate. I don't want to make new friends. I don't want to go college and waste 4 years of my already short life just to learn things I've already taught myself so that I can scrape-by in a career that I actually enjoy. I certainly don't want to grow up and spend my life working a job I hate so that I don't starve. All I want out of life is to extract as much beauty, pleasure, and awe as I can during my time here. I want to be wealthy with experiences, love, and satisfaction, not money. I'm not a straight \"A\" student, I'm extremely disorganized, and I have little work ethic when it comes to things I don't care about. I lack skill in these very particular areas, and so I don't get to enjoy the world or experience life unless I spend it working for someone else, never truly indulging in the fruits of my unfulfilling labor. Rather, I will be given an allowance by my bourgeoisie employer every two weeks based on what he thinks I deserve. How can you not be miserable when you know that this is, statistically, what your future consists of? Who wouldn't want to stay fried out of their mind if all they had to look forward to for the majority of life is 50+ years working until their employer or the government allows them to finally quit? I more than likely will not be successful, at least not in society's twisted version of success. I don't think I'm cut out for the way of life that we all seem to pursue. I don't care to make money. The only incentive I see in having lots of money is that I would be able to do whatever I want and live the life I choose. I don't have any clue what I'll truly do in the future. I want more than anything to be a cast member on SNL, and sometimes, especially when I'm high on Adderall, I become passionate about that goal that I created for myself in my naivety. Everything is so rigged and bullshit.  I love making people laugh, and one of my true few passions is doing so. I used to pride myself in my ability to control the direction of conversations and my natural tendency to be able to make the entire class laugh. Regardless, I probably won't be able to make a viable career out of it. We live in a system that would rather pay me to flip burgers or stick a screw into an iPhone than it would to make people laugh and bring people joy. Which is really worth more? I have nothing to offer this world besides my ability to sell my labor. Does that sound like a life worth living? Why am I expected to just accept the fact that I have to sell my mind and body so that I can have basic needs fulfilled? \n\nI am so similar to my uncle, it scares me. He was also a master of the social circle, only he was far more skilled and charismatic than me. He was the most popular person in high school thanks to his skill in making people laugh. Everyone liked him and everyone wanted to be like him. Now he is homeless, 34 years old, has burnt all his bridges and is in jail. I have a living example to not follow yet I'm certain I'm headed down the same path as him, only much earlier. I'm scared. I'm extremely lonely, even though I always have people to talk to. I feel so incredibly alienated from the rest of the world. I think that's what has changed me the most. Not to be cliche, but I have never felt like anyone has ever understood what it is exactly that I'm going through. I hardly understand it. Surely, a simple chemical imbalance in my brain and couple of genes isn't to blame for whatever goes on in my head. I see my siblings and their completely normal, human, childish antics and rather than being entertained I am disgusted. How can they be so simple minded? How are they genuinely happy right now? The closest I get to happiness is the excitement I feel when someone with a dab pen at school beckons me over to get high with them. When I'm sober, I often sit on the couch, enveloped by pure dread and misery, while my siblings argue over who ate the rest of the ice cream or laugh and sing random songs together. It drives me to the brink of insanity. I can't stand watching them interact and it makes me angry that they have such simple, relatively happy lives. I shouldn't really say lives - we live in the same house and experience most of the same things. Besides in our own social groups, there is not a lot of difference between our home environments. In fact, I would say that the two of them who live with their father actually do have it bad. I got decently lucky with sane parents - God only knows where I'd be if I had to live with people like that. I envy my siblings and their stable, uncorrupted minds.  I can't imagine waking up and just looking forward to playing video games like them anymore. I used to really enjoy playing on my PS4 and dedicated time to doing so regularly. Now I have even more free time, yet can't find the time to enjoy myself anymore unless its through drugs. For their sake, I hope they missed out on the genes for addiction and mental illness.\n\nI don't want to rely on abusing drugs to feel like a normal, happy human being. I wasted my entire junior year smoking weed and crying over a girl that wasn't worth crying over. I want so badly to just start the year over and actually do something productive. I think of all the friendships, events, and experiences that I've missed out on this year and I loathe myself for putting myself in this position. It was completely avoidable, and if I would have just made one or two slightly better decisions, I'd be in a much better, much happier place. All that I experience, instead, are feelings of existential dread and thoughts of how miserable/unsuccessful/lonely I'll be in 5 years. I am not excited for anything. All I can think about is the irony of the fact that if I wouldn't have chosen to smoke or use pills to cope, I'd be far happier and would probably be having a lot of fun around this time, and certainly would have already come to terms with the breakup that hurt me so bad. Instead I'll probably spend the entire summer stuck in the house, still just as miserable and unmotivated as I've been. I don't know what to do at this point. It's now 5:13 AM. I can't really write much more. All in all, I'm just stuck.  I don't know who I'll share the future with, and the idea that everyone I care about and value will soon be a part of the past scares me. Getting older scares me. Changes in the people I surround myself with scare me. I feel like I'm literally broken, as in dysfunctional. I feel like a defective toy or a failed science experiment. I don't belong.",

            "selftext": "And I emphasize the word 'heavily'. For me, Minecraft was a straight up serious addiction. Never in a million years did I think I would get addicted to a game like Minecraft. \n\nIt all started back in 2017. I've always been obsessed with architecture, and a friend of mine recommended that I start playing Minecraft, in order to express my architectural creativity. At first I thought the idea was silly. Because I've honestly never been all that into gaming. But being bored and not having anything else better to do, I decided to give Minecraft a try. And right from the start, I was hooked.  My first project was to built a mega city. Within less than 2 months, I had constructed an insanely massive virtual city. And this was a project that went on for almost a year. \n\nThe problem was, I was playing Minecraft for over 8 hours a day. It became relentless. Keep in mind, this is before I had a job and real responsibilities. And in the process, I became incredibly lazy, over-caffeinated, stressed, sleep deprived, super depressed, isolated, and just downright unhealthy. Staring at a screen for such a lengthy period of time put such a strain on my eyes. Sometimes it felt like my eyes were going to bleed. Building the mega city became like a job or an obligation for me. It was actually becoming stressful, as to where in the beginning, I played Minecraft to relieve stress. \n\nAnd it became quickly obvious that I was addicted to the game. It was the first thing I did when I woke up. I lost interest in pretty much everything else. I quit playing guitar and gave up writing. Even when I was going to sleep, that's all I could think about. I eventually started building other things, like mansions. I wasn't at all interested in survival mode or playing with friends. All I wanted to do, was to be left alone, and build. Whenever I wasn't playing Minecraft, that's all I was thinking about. Just being away from the game instilled feelings of anxiety, panic, and aggression. It literally consumed my life. Nothing else mattered. And as a result, my mind felt so scattered. Outside of Minecraft, I didn't see a meaning in my life anymore. I felt like such a useless human being. \n\nI finally snapped out of my Minecraft trance and decided that for my own well-being, I needed to quit the game. It's almost over a year now since I played it. And honestly, it was for the best. I feel better since I quit playing it. But still...I think about it sometimes. But my gut instinct tells me not to. The problem with a game like Minecraft, especially if you have a highly dedicated architectural mindset like me, is that the game will never end. As long as you can keep building, the game will go on indefinitely.",

No one knows I\u2019m addicted to painkillers. I\u2019ve been taking OxyContin OP 80mg every day for about 7 months now. Sometimes I\u2019ll take a whole one or a little more in a day, but I can\u2019t take it all at once, otherwise I get sick. Sometimes I take hydrocodone with it. On weekends I drink on top of it. I don\u2019t feel happy if I don\u2019t wake up and start biting off bits of this 80 mg pill and down it with my coffee. They\u2019re expired, I found them in an old medicine cabinet. Before I was addicted to OxyContin, I was addicted to hydrocodone alone for about a year until my family found out and intervened. I took about 4-5 10 mg pills a day at most. I quit for about 3 or 4 months cold turkey. This addiction is messing with my body and I know the health problems arising are because of it. I no longer have a menstrual period, I\u2019ve lost weight, I deal with terrible anxiety knowing I have to do this to feel normal and happy.. but I\u2019m at work now, and planning and dumping the rest of my pills when I get home. But I need advice.. should I seek medical help while quitting? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been doing it long enough to suffer life threatening withdrawals... I think? I have access to Valium which I\u2019ve read helps with withdrawal (I\u2019ve never enjoyed benzodiazepines, but if it helps with the withdrawals, I will take them). I\u2019m not sure which route to take and I understand using one drug to get off another without medical supervision could be dangerous and turn into yet another addiction. Taking opiates has always made me feel better, I\u2019m more talkative, more personable, overall just a nicer person. I feel like it is needed in order for me to be, well, me? A happy me. Sometimes I go home after working a 12 hour shift and feel so sad  just thinking about the fact that I\u2019m still abusing these pills that I told myself were just for a day, then a week, then a month, and now it\u2019s been close to a year... then I wake up in the morning and the guilt is gone and I start the cycle over again. I just could really take any advice, personal battles with addiction.. I\u2019m ready to overcome it NOW. I don\u2019t want to wait any longer.",

Didn't get out of bed till 4, didn't do anything I needed to get done, felt like a lump. Couldn't even motivate myself to watch TV in bed. \n\nThe guy said he would deliver at 9pm. I walked over to the drug store at 730 to buy beer and a few syringes. But instead of 3 tall boys and needles, I left the store with a gallon of milk, a dozen eggs, bacon, and salt (I was out of salt). I got home, texted the dude that I actually didn't want anything and I deleted &amp; blocked his ##. \n\nInstead of getting high, I'm making breakfast. I just finished a pot of coffee and set the dough for biscuits to rise. When those go in the oven, I'll make some sausage gravy, fry up some nice crispy bacon, and cook like 5 scrambled eggs. I might even heat up a can of baked beans and fry some shrooms with garlic and onions. \n\nI wish I could share this food with you all (no I don't) for the words of encouragement and positivity this sub gives to people. Considering that my day sucked and I was 45 minutes away from a relapse, I feel pretty good rn and I just wanted to tell someone. Breakfast is a powerful thing.",

He was prescribed Tramadol and took it daily but after a few months he started to abuse it and once he started running out early he started buying Oxycodone. After fours years of taking one or the other, 24 hours a day 7 days a week, he decided he wanted to get sober. He struggled with the withdrawal symptoms and relapsed several times, until he took a medication called Lyrica that his Dr was prescribing but he had never taken. The Lyrica didn\u2019t eliminate his symptoms but it took them from a 10 to a 5 or 6 and most importantly helped him sleep through the night. Lyrica can be habit forming so he was careful not to trade one habit for another but it was helpful enough that he was able to get sober after years of addiction. I just wanted to share this information because I know how impactful it was on his life and seeing him now is like seeing a completely different person. I don\u2019t known that he\u2019d be sober today if it wasn\u2019t for the Lyrica. And I\u2019m not suggesting that anyone acquire this illegally but if you can get a prescription I\u2019m sure it can help. He said it was a miracle for him.",

It's the first time I've ever openly talked about drug use like this, which is half the battle I suppose.\n\nI've done my fair share of experimenting with different drugs when I was younger, stopping doing drugs with no issues. Started up a coke habit again about 5 years ago, and it's gotten worse over the last year or two (I'm a bartender, and even though I don't use on the job, the atmosphere/after-work crowd is definitely enabling.)\n\nI do about a gram or 2 two-three times a week. It's starting to affect my job and my relationship with my boyfriend and family. My boyfriend doesn't know I've gotten back into a coke habit, but I just told my Dad yesterday, who was surprisingly very understanding.\n\nMy question is where do I go from here recovery-wise? I thought about just not doing it, thinking I can stop on my own. But I've always ended up relapsing after three days tops, so I clearly need to try something different. \n\nI don't know if NA/AA is for me, though maybe other people's stories might help out with my perspective on everything.\n\nThis is all so so new to me so thank you so much for taking the time to read everyone!",

How do I  quit coke without quitting other drugs? I feel other drugs can be very positive and help me get out of my shel but coke makes me lock my room for 12+ hours. Thanks in advance",

            "selftext": "So my sister who is 20 has been using heroin since she was 17, she started because her boyfriend was an addict and got her into it, since then she's stolen thousands of dollars from my father and low enough to steal my little brother's life savings from his piggy bank. just yesterday she called my dad up so she can go to detox only because her boyfriend is going and she is not taking it seriously at all. She told my dad she likes using heroin because its \"fun\" and all her friends do it and gets a rush from it, I really think she doesn't care about ruining her life. I asked her what she plans on doing with her life and suggested she get a job at a daycare since she's excellent with kids, but told her she would need to get clean first, she said she can still work with kids on heroin and her excuse was \" I know a lot of people with good jobs that use and can still manage\"  My question is to former addicts what made you get clean? and how did you stay clean? Did you find it fun?  I have kinda lost hope for her. idk what to do. im 19. PS; I should note that even before this she was very defiant and difficult. She has stated that she only cares about herself and loves herself and that people revolve around her. She has been clinically dead twice so i don't know why that wasn't a wake up call for her",

Inevitably, I'll clean up one thing, but then others remain, or become more pronounced. \n\nMy problem is not that I feel I'm not accomplishing enough. I think I'm doing okay in that way. But I don't feel good and I want my mind to be less distracted. Maybe just \"cleaner\" if that's an appropriate word.\n\nHistorically:\n\n- Smoked too much pot for a while, but cleaned up. For the last 2 years, it's maybe been smoked once per year. Not an issue today.\n\n- Alcohol. It comes and goes. It's not an issue during the day. But I just often drink a bit too much during the evenings and it affects my sleep and then my next day.\n\n- Porn. Waste too much time on it (and money).\n\n- Crappy TV shows and a general electronics \"addiction\" if that's fair to say. It doesn't allow my mind to be focused.\n\nAlcohol, in my opinion, is the easiest to cut out. I'm going to struggle more with porn and useless TV. They're a huge waste of time. Ideally, they should be replaced with something like making home cooked meals and working out. I'm a runner already, but my nutrition is pretty crappy and I'm sure holding me back. I could also pick up some books.\n\nI'll welcome any feedback folks might have.",

            "selftext": "Hi all.\n\nI've been pondering this for a while but I think I could be addicted to codeine.\n\nLong story short I've been prescribed co codamol (30/500mg) for around 7 years ago and have been taking upto 8 tablets a day initially (due to kidney stone pain) and then I just kept taking them. Over the past say 5 years I've taken several tablets a day and most of the time it's for no reason or some \"phantom\" pain. I've noticed that when i don't take any I start to get what i guess is withdrawals. Mainly achey restless legs and cold like symptoms and it's driving me mad.\n\nI've done plenty of research online and most addicts have/are taking a far greater dosage then me so that's why im hesitant to jump on the addiction train. I do read though that some can get addicted to small amounts so I guess im just swirling around in circles at the moment.\n\nOf course I need to go see my doc. For the record I'm also on metformin for type 2 diabetes (since last year) sertraline for depression and amlopodine for BP. I was just wondering if anyone else had been through this symptom wise and with taking a similar dosage.\n\nThanks in advance.",

I was almost addicted to everything you can imagine except heroin, now I descided to turn around my life and break out of all my bad habbits. My personal goal is to be on the front page of Mens Health in 3 years but thats not the topic here. Now I would like to take people on a journey about personal development, sporty and healthy lifestyle but also with mindset/self confidence topics with a blog, vlog or sth. like that to think about their habbits and break out of that stuff because I have seen that addictions/bad habbits are a topic thats not talk about except some hollywood stars and musicans and even there its a taboo. You think this is a proper way to do that ? Could this kind of content be interesting for people ? What would you say on a \"influencer\" (i dont linke this word) like this?",

The longer I'm sober, the worse it gets until I plateau. Takes about 6 months of sobriety before it plateaus. Almost a year before it starts getting better. That's what the doctors say anyway. I'm shivering and twitching. It's fucking awful. It's embarrassing to even go out in public. I cancelled my appointments for the day. It's a double edged sword. The meds that help make me tired. So, I'm triggered by the twitch and I'm triggered by the fatigue.

            "selftext": "Hello everyone on r/addiction, \n\nIf you are addicted to alcohol and/or other drugs, should you attend AA/NA meetings? Do these meetings actually help people over\n\n**\"It works,\"** is what the Twelve Steppers tell you at every meeting. They know what your problem is: you have the disease of addiction! According to the NA book, Sixth Edition:\n\n&gt;As addicts, we have an incurable disease called addiction. The disease is chronic, progressive and fatal. However, it is a treatable disease . . . We realize that we are never cured, and that we carry the disease within us for the rest of our lives. We have a disease, but we do recover. Each day we are given another chance. We are convinced that there is only one way for us to live, and that is the NA way (pp. 7-8).\n\nNeuroscientist &amp; former drug-addict [Marc Lewis](https://www.memoirsofanaddictedbrain.com) does not agree that addiction is a disease:\n\n&gt;\u2026is addiction a disease?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This book makes the case that it isn\u2019t. Addiction results, rather, from the motivated repetition of the same thoughts and behaviours until they become habitual. Thus, addiction develops\u2014it\u2019s learned\u2014but it\u2019s learned more deeply and often more quickly than most other habits, due to a narrowing tunnel of attention and attraction. A close look at the brain highlights the role of desire in this process. The neural circuitry of desire governs anticipation, focused attention, and behaviour. So the most attractive goals will be pursued repeatedly, while other goals lose their appeal, and that *repetition* (rather than the drugs, booze, or gambling) will change the brain\u2019s wiring. As with other developing habits, this process is grounded in a neurochemical feedback loop that\u2019s present in all normal brains. But it cycles more persistently because of the frequent recurrence of desire and the shrinking range of *what* is desired. Addiction arises from the same feelings that bind lovers to each other and children tot heir parents. And it builds on the same cognitive mechanisms that get us to value short-term gains over long-term benefits. Addiction is unquestionably destructive, yet it is also uncannily normal: an inevitable feature of the basic human design. That\u2019s what makes it so difficult to grasp\u2014socially, scientifically, and clinically.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I believe that the disease idea is wrong, and that its wrongness is compounded by a biased view of the neural data\u2014and by doctors\u2019 and scientists\u2019 habit of ignoring the personal. It\u2019s an idea that can be replaced, not by shunning the biology of addiction by by examining it more closely, and then connecting it back to lived experience. Medical researchers are correct that the brain changes with addiction. But the *way* it changes has to do with learning and development\u2014not disease.\n\nFor more information on this subject, read [The Biology of Desire: Why Addiction Is Not a Disease](https://www.amazon.ca/Biology-Desire-Why-Addiction-Disease/dp/1610397126) by Marc Lewis.\n\nLots of people with addictions **are not helped** by the teaching that they have a \"chronic, progressive, and fatal\" / \"incurable disease\" that is causing them to drink excessively or abuse dangerous drugs. In my opinion, this is one of the many reasons why **AA/NA** **is objectively ineffective**. \n\nLance Dodes discusses the efficacy of AA in-depth in his book, [The Sober Truth](https://www.amazon.ca/s?k=the+sober+truth&amp;i=stripbooks&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_1):\n\n&gt;At least one early attempt to study Alcoholics Anonymous in a randomized experiment was run by J.M. Brandsma (of the College of Medicine at the University of Kentucky) and colleagues in 1980. Eighty individuals, mainly court-referred, were randomized into three groups: AA-based treatment run by the investigators; a course of one-on-one RBT (rational behaviour therapy) run by lay people; and an open option for patients to choose any treatment they wished, which constituted a control group.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;The investigators found \u201csignificantly more binge drinking at the 3-month follow-up\u201d among the people assigned to the AA-oriented meetings. As the year mark approached, the researchers noted, \u201cAll of the lay-RBT clients reported drinking less during the last 3 months. This was significantly better than the AA or the control groups at the 0.005 level \\[meaning the finding was highly statistically significant\\].\u201d The final data led the researchers to conclude: \u201cIn this analysis **the AA group was five times more likely to binge than the control group and nine times more likely than the lay-RBT group.** The AA group average was 2.4 binges in the last 3 months.\n\nThere was another study in 1991:\n\n&gt;It took until 1991 for another randomized study to be completed. This one found essentially the same results as the Brandsma study. In a paper published in the *New England Journal of Medicine,* the oldest continuously published medical journal in the world and widely considered the world\u2019s most prestigious, D.C. Walsh and his co-researchers randomly assigned a series of 227 workers newly identified as abusing alcohol to one of three rehabilitation regimens: compulsory inpatient treatment, compulsory attendance at AA meetings, and a choice of options. The findings were notable:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cOn seven measures of drinking and drug use\u2026we found significant differences at several follow-up assessments. The hospital group fared best and that assigned to AA the least well; those allowed to choose a program had intermediate outcomes. Additional inpatient treatment was required significantly more often\u2026by the AA group (63 percent) and the choice group (38 percent) than by subjects assigned to initial treatment in the hospital (23 percent).\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\[ *The Sober Truth* \\]\n\nBut here is the nail in the coffin for AA/NA:\n\n&gt;In 2006 the Cochrane Collaboration, the internationally recognized gold standard of impartial assessment and evidence-based practice, issued a report on the effectiveness of AA and other 12-step programs in achieving and maintaining abstinence, improving quality of life, and reducing alcohol-associated problems. The committee pored over every major database they could find, medical and psychological, involving men and women who were attending voluntary or coerced programs. They ended up with eight trials that involved 3,417 people and concluded: \u201c**No experimental studies unequivocally demonstrated the effectiveness of AA or \\[other 12-step\\] approaches for reducing alcohol dependence or problems**.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\[ *Skeptic Magazine,* Volume 19, Number 4, \"Does AA Work?\" by Carol Tavris \\] \n\nHere are some of my thoughts:\n\nIf you enjoy going to AA/NA, and following the Twelve Step Religion has made your life better, **that's great!** You have the right to practice any religion you choose. But I wish everybody would wake up to the fact that the Twelve Step Religion is just that: it's a religion. **The Twelve Step Religion \"works\" for addiction about as much as praying to Jesus \"works\" for curing disease.** At church, you will certainly run across some people who claim that God cured their \\[insert ailment\\] because they prayed for healing. At Twelve Step Meetings, you will run across some people who insist that following the Twelve Step Religion solved their problems with addiction. That's great! I'm happy for those people. \n\nBut it's dangerous to promote your belief that \"praying to Jesus cures disease.\" [Bad things happen](https://www.apnews.com/3a8b31ee791044458e6cf08595529960) when you take that belief really seriously.\n\nIt is also dangerous to promote the belief that \"the Twelve Step Relgion works for addiction,\" and it's *even more* dangerous to promote the belief that \"the Twelve Step Religion is *the only thing* that works for addiction.\" The evidence shows that the Twelve Step Religion *does not* and *will not work* for the vast majority of people. **Chances are, going to AA/NA Meetings will not \"work\" for you.** Even worse, going to AA/NA Meetings might make it *even harder* for you to stay sober, because the Twelve Step Religion promotes distorted falsehoods like:\n\n* Staying sober is exceedingly difficult for \"addicts\"\n* As an \"addict,\" your brain is permanently defective\n* You are incapable of simply choosing to stay sober, on your own\n* As an \"addict,\" you will &amp; you must continue drinking after the first drink\n\nI'm sure I'll write more on this subject: My critique of the Twelve Step Religion, and why I believe that its teachings are antithetical to sobriety. But that will be for another day. \n\nFor today, the message is: AA/NA does not exactly work.The Twelve Step Religion \"works\" in the same way that becoming an evangelical Christian or a Muslim might \"work\" for some people with substance abuse issues.",

While each animal wandered through the maze, its brain was working furiously. Every time a rat sniffed the air or scratched a wall, the neurosensors inside the animal\u2019s head exploded with activity. As the scientists repeated the experiment, again and again, the rats eventually stopped sniffing corners and making wrong turns and began to zip through the maze with more and more speed. And within their brains, something unexpected occurred: as each rat learned how to complete the maze more quickly, its mental activity decreased. As the path became more and more automatic \u2014 as it became a habit \u2014 the rats started thinking less and less.\n\n&gt; This process, in which the brain converts a sequence of actions into an automatic routine, is called \u201cchunking.\u201d There are dozens, if not hundreds, of behavioral chunks we rely on every day. Some are simple: you automatically put toothpaste on your toothbrush before sticking it in your mouth. Some, like making the kids\u2019 lunch, are a little more complex. Still others are so complicated that it\u2019s remarkable to realize that a habit could have emerged at all.\n\n&gt; Take backing your car out of the driveway. When you first learned to drive, that act required a major dose of concentration, and for good reason: it involves peering into the rearview and side mirrors and checking for obstacles, putting your foot on the brake, moving the gearshift into reverse, removing your foot from the brake, estimating the distance between the garage and the street while keeping the wheels aligned, calculating how images in the mirrors translate into actual distances, all while applying differing amounts of pressure to the gas pedal and brake.\n\nThe article is pretty long, but totally worth it imo.",

I was a chronic weed smoker for about 8 years, but it never really interfered with my life.  A couple years ago I started using pills, mostly oxys, ritalin, and dilaudid.  This year my drug of choice seems to be cocaine.  At first it was only a gram every couple weeks, and now it's almost a ball every weekend, maybe a gram in between weekends.  I've suffered from depression for a long time.  Been to multiple therapists, although my current one I've had for 7ish years.  She recently suggested I check out an NA meeting in the area as she's become concerned with my increased use.  I said I would, but I haven't yet.  I don't know if sitting their listening to people's stories is going to actually do anything for me.  Shit, I watch Intervention while getting high lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat has your experience with NA been like?",

I had spent such a long time feeling like shit a suicidal so I didn't know what else to do. This led into spending a couple of months total in an inpatient psych hospital where they tried to help me but I only ever wanted more DXM. It took me many months, and quite honestly I never would've been able to stop if it wasn't for my girlfriend (of 10 months now). My last relapse was in August but I'm still constantly having thoughts/urges to take it again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   So now for the self-hatred. A lot of it stems from hating that I'm still living with the thoughts of it even after 10 months, I know it was all my choices but I never wanted this. I hate so many of the things I've done, the way I acted towards my family and those who cared about me, the way I destroyed my own brain, the way I got expelled from school because of it, the way I ruined everything I had going for me and who I used to be and it just goes on. I used to be a straight-A student and always did good in school and was always told I had so much potential and I threw it all away the second I got some freedom and now I'm stuck living as a product of my past. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   It always feels like my family hasn't looked at me the same since and I always feel like I've let everyone down. I barely even fucking passed this year and almost had to do 9th grade for a third damn time because I got no credits form when I was expelled. My family has always done a good job of keeping all of our drug addict relatives (and there's a lot) away from us as we grew up but I became exactly what they wanted nothing to do with in under a year. It always feels like I couldn't be a bigger disappointment and they all had to watch me throw away everything they have ever done for me. And that hurts more than fucking anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   I've even been losing sleep over it because I just can't stop remembering. I know this turned into a bit of a rant but I don't know where else to go. I'd want to tell my girlfriend but I don't know if that's the best option to be honest. I have a hard time feeling like she'd want to hear it and would genuinely care a lot but that might just be my own fucked up thinking. Plus I don't like her knowing that I'm dealing with this kind of stuff because it only makes me feel worse when I don't know if she thinks less of me or just doesn't understand. I'd rather her see me as someone better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   I know I should accept it as the past and I can't change it but no matter what it always finds a way to come back and get me. I'm the kind of person to let things be in the past and that today is what matters and moving forward but I can't escape these thoughts sometimes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone else feel this, or have any advice on what I should do?",

He stoned alone and regularly but that was ok. Then 7 months ago he ordered speed from the dark web. He's ADD so it was a good self medication for him. But things got out of hand soon. He snorted 20g over 2 Months and after that a 20g bag of high quality speed over 3 months. Then he got a prescription for Adderall. He claimed it will help him and that the speeding will be over. That he will only take the prescribed dose orally. Now he snorts that shit. He has used Benzodiazepines to come down. He drinks 1-3 beers, smokes weed in addition. When confronted with his obvious problems he denies having problems and said things at his job are still going well. Hes in total genial. I think if he keeps on doing what he does, he will go down HARD. \n\nWe want to helpt him. Stop him taking drugs. Me and my friend are his best buddies. We always stick together. The only other real close person to him is his girlfriend.\n\n I WANT TO HELP HIM SO BAD. I don't want to see him going down. I don't want to lose him.\n\nPlease somebody give me some advice. I don't know what to do.",

I\u2019m getting to my wit\u2019s end with it, and I don\u2019t know how to help or where to go with it.\n\nCannabis has been a big part of his life since he was a young teenager (we\u2019re early twenties now). We\u2019ve not been together long (about 6 months) and when we got together, he\u2019d kicked the habit. I fell for him immediately. \n\nNow, though, he\u2019s turned back to it and I don\u2019t know how to cope. I smoked somewhat when I was a teenager, but very casually and I lost interest when I went to uni. I don\u2019t really have any strong feelings either way about it, but I have some experience of it so I can understand to an extent. \n\nHe\u2019s tried probably 10 ish times to quit as far as I\u2019m aware, and each time it doesn\u2019t work. He\u2019s quite adamant that this or that won\u2019t work when I suggest things to help. I\u2019m trying to be as supportive as I possibly can, not nag him or anything, but honestly it\u2019s becoming what seems like an insurmountable problem :( he smokes before bed to help him sleep, which I don\u2019t mind in itself, but it makes him groggy, grumpy etc. the next day. His libido is also lowered when he\u2019s smoking every day, and also when he\u2019s quitting. He\u2019s becoming distant with me when we\u2019re not together which I\u2019m finding really upsetting.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do :( I love him so so much but I can\u2019t deal with this forever. I want to spend my life with him but I don\u2019t want it to be like this - I also don\u2019t want to give him an ultimatum because I know how hard addiction can be. \n\nPlease help!

I used to spend all of my time studying and with friends; now I spend 90% of my time jerking off and just being alone. \n\nI have a routine of going on to Omegle, spending upwards of two hours finding someone who is willing to send nudes, then once I finish I block them. I deeply regret it now that I have had time to think, but when I\u2019m in the moment I couldn\u2019t care less.

He slept through his alarm but I arrive early everywhere, so I was able to get him up and get him out the door and to work on time at 6:15am.\n\nHalf way through his shift he texted me to pick him up. I figured it was a slow shift so he was sent home early. I had my wife and kids with me to pick my brother from work around 10am.\n\nHe was high, but not so high he could not walk or speak. He had been struggling with addiction to opiates for 19 years. I asked him if I needed to take him to the doctor and he said he would just need to sleep this off. I dropped him off, watched him go inside, and that was the last time I saw my brother alive. \n\nI fell asleep around 7pm because I was feeling ill. My wife took my kids to a fireworks show but came home before it started. She woke me up saying my eldest brother was trying to call me because my younger brother had been found dead by his girlfriend. I put on my clothes and I drove to my younger brother's house. My eldest brother was there helping to direct the sheriff, the coroner, and the other first responders, and I was tasked with taking my younger brother's girlfriend home since she was in no shape to drive. \n\nMy children (10 &amp; 11) are heartbroken, but they do not know how their uncle passed away. Does anyone have any resources I can use to help them better understand drug addiction anf overdosing before I have this discussion with them?",

Namely, to a drug provided to me before I started dating my bf (30m) who has a medical need and prescription for said drug.\n\n I havent taken it in months, and it hasnt been a huge issue besides the occasional desire to find someone to get me some which I always back out of. Well, my boyfriend recently started getting it refilled as often as hes supposed to (money was an issue for awhile so he couldnt)\n\nThe first day he came home after taking it as prescribed, I could tell the change in him and how he was so upbeat and happy...then came the resentment and jealousy because I cant have it. I know this is ridiculous and I want to find a healthy way to deal with these feelings when they occur. I want him to know I support him and absolutely agree he needs these meds and my personal battle shouldn't make him feel guilty for that. How can I stop being triggered and letting my cravings ruin our days together?",

This last year I began taking Xanax with my alcohol intake and was doing that for quite a while. I went to rehab and I had 5 months clean but I relapsed for 2 months and now I just have 2 days. I\u2019m finding it hard to enjoy things. I\u2019m with my family on vacation. I don\u2019t even feel that much joy. I just want to get completely fucked up. But we\u2019re out in the countryside and I would have to drive to a bar or a liquor store to get some liquor. Back where I live usually I just walk out the door and get my alcohol. I am completely sworn off Xanax but the alcohol keeps calling me. I\u2019m having  a serious problem in which sometimes when talking to certain people, while I am speaking with them or am aware of their presence, in my mind my face kind of melts to be their face.  Maybe it does this for me to be better suited for them to appreciate me because I feel like my normal self won\u2019t be appreciated by them. It\u2019s really annoying and I wish it would stop. I am afraid I have developed a really bad neurological disorder. Maybe It\u2019s just depression. I don\u2019t know what it is but it\u2019s kind of scary.  Like I do have a sense of self but I feel like it\u2019s easily swayed and my emotions are easily manipulated.  I am a thrill seeker. The mundanity of life, of little conversations don\u2019t really click for me. I just wanna get fucked up again. I might be doomed actually. Maybe I just need clean time to properly assess what is happening. I want to get better but I just don\u2019t know if I have the strength to do it. If this mental face switching phenomenon will ever stop. I feel flighty and it feels like when I speak my words don\u2019t have s proper weight to them if that makes sense. I know I just have 2 days clean but I\u2019ve really messed myself up over the years I think. I just hope I can heal and that I can look forward to tomorrow being a better, emotionally regular, strong sense of self person. Some days I look in the mirror and I\u2019m like surprised by the way I look. Like who is this guy? I\u2019m balding and I\u2019ve got this big bushy beard and it makes me look like a bit older than what I actually am. I\u2019ve been shutting off my brain for so many years every single night or damn near that. 3 times a week in the least. This post is very unorganized I know, but I\u2019m just writing to get my thoughts out into a community that can probably understand. If I really wanna heal I\u2019ve gotta go to aa again probably and I fucking hate aa.",

He is charismatic, attractive, intelligent and charming as hell. He has also been an addict since he was 16. \n\n12 years ago he got clean through MAT. Then he was in a serious car accident, given opioids in the hospital, against his wishes, and for recovery after multiple surgeries to correct the injuries he sustained. \n\nWithin 1 year of the accident he was bankrupt and using full time again. \n\nMagically he was able to get himself clean a few months later and we had a good run for awhile, until tonight. \n\nHe got home from his job on the water working a lobster boat. Went upstairs to take a shower, presumably shot up and collapsed onto the bathroom floor. His wife started CPR and called 911. The paramedics on the scene administered 3 doses of Narcan. It took them 25 min of CPR and shocking him to get a pulse. \n\nWhen I first got the call I was going to get in my car and drive 5 hours home. All I could think about was how my mom needed someone there to support her through the night. I decided I would wait an hour to make a plan. Nearing the end of the hour my mom called me. We ran through the facts of the situation, discussed how we had missed the signs this time, considered who the supplier was of this batch. You know, your typical OD discussion. About an hour into the call my mom says to me \u201cwell I\u2019ve got some fish I had left out on the counter before I got the call, so I better start dinner\u201d.\nWe said our \u201clove yous\u201d and hung up. \n\nThe one thing I can\u2019t shake from this experience is the fact that my mothers son was dead for 25min today and my mom had to then move on so quickly to cooking dinner because we know that as badly as we want to, we can\u2019t fix him.",

This is where I am now because of my actions, actions that I don't truly understand. Am I a very bad person, or is this truly a disease, or is it both? I can't decide but here goes. And yes, this is a gigantic broken record....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been in love with, and addicted to gambling since the age of 18. It is that simple. To people that know me, this is no longer a surprise. I used to be able to control it for periods of time, long periods of time. I used to win, or lose, and be okay with the outcome. I used to be able to save money and take care of myself. Gambling used to be about the money, which in itself is bad enough. At some point in my life though, it took an even more disturbing turn. It was no longer about the money. It was about the smell of the casino, the atmosphere, the people, the rush... gambling became what I wanted to do, all day and every day. This slowly lead me into more and more debt. Putting off bills to gamble, putting off getting food to gamble, putting off basically everything... to gamble. There have been countless times where I received help with bills and debt, and I do mean countless. This help came from people that cared about me, sometimes it was my friends, sometimes my dad, but 99.9% of the time this help came from my mom. My friends, I always seemed to pay back eventually, my mom however... not so much. She still continued to love me and support me all the same. How? I can't begin to comprehend this love. Fast forward a bit... by the good graces of others I would sporadically find myself almost\\* back to even. I could work, save money, pay bills, take care of myself, and live life like a normal human being. Did I ever do that? Rarely.... very rarely. I would slowly crawl my way back into a gambling hole, and each time digging out would become more difficult. This is where some other issues surface. Most notably, drinking. I began to find it much easier to deal with the shame and guilt of my actions by drinking while gambling. It became easier to lie. It became easier to pawn things. This is where it really gets ugly... It became easier to steal from my mom. I would justify all of this by delusional drunken thoughts that I NEED this money because I NEED to get out of this debt... In reality, I NEEDED to gamble more. Now try and understand this... even after stealing from my mom, she still continued to help me. My friends, they still continued to help me. The problem is, nobody would ever truly know how deep I was, because I lied. I continued to think, I won't tell them this, or that, but the amount that they give me should be enough to win enough to solve everything... It is like putting a band-aid on a broken arm and expecting it to heal. I would never truly let anyone know the true gravity of my situation. Shame, guilt, fear, it doesn't matter, I thought I would fix this myself... I would get drunk at the casino and win a huge jackpot, it is definitely going to happen. I will pay it all back and be out of debt AND THEN SOME! Instead of telling my friends, my mom, my dad, or anyone of my true serious debt, I would continue to receive little band-aids. Sadly though, in reality, these band-aids could have been enough, had I used them correctly. I just didn't fucking care. I still wanted to gamble, so I did. And I wanted to get drunk, so I did. The real underlying mental issues that lead to this, I am not qualified to speak on. I know what AA says, I know that addiction is now widely considered a disease, but could I simply just be an awful and selfish person? Either way, fast forwarding to even more recently... the past debt continues to pile up. Band-aids are truly not fixing it this time. I have dug a hole far too deep. My irresponsible ways, my poisoned ways of thinking, my gambling and drinking, my long shot hail-mary attempts to save this, have all lead to losing one job, which lead to a rehab that I did not take seriously at all. This now brings me to this past winter/spring. Working a job with GrubHub in order to try and start over again. I was making pretty good money during the winter time. I still wasn't thinking correctly though. The debt was still gigantic, the non-stop phone calls all day every day from debt collectors were a reality. All of this, deserved on my part. My past actions brought me here, and I understand this. As I said though, still not thinking correctly. I want this all to be solved in ONE DAY. I continued to hardly save anything, because what is the point? I am too far into it. I need to get drunk and I need to gamble. That will solve everything. Deep down I knew that it wouldn't. I knew it was going to give me the rush I was looking for. But the other side of my mind continued to justify these actions because what if I do win... what if I do save this, I need to save this, today. Of course, this doesn't work out and I continue to fall further down into the hole. As warmer weather arrives the delivery job drys up and money coming in gets drastically cut off. More band-aids from people, (because of more lies from me), which at this point even if I do use these band-aids correctly will be negligible at saving me financially. Now I am just going on drinking/gambling binges with whatever I can get my hands on. Fuck it all, I am toast. I finally take something from my mom for the last time, she is gone now, and I can not blame her one bit. It is truly devastating. Moving on again, somehow I actually land a decent job about 2 weeks ago, but before I even get my first paycheck I know what is going to happen... I have it all planned out. Everything is coming to a head now... and here is how I think: I get my first paycheck, which WILL NOT save me, it truly won't. Even If I use that entire $600 paycheck on my car payment, I will still lose my car, I owe $1500 on it to be back to caught up. I know that my car insurance payment, I can't make it either, so I can no longer drive the car anyway. I have expired registration on the car so driving it is already bad enough. My only last hope is to gamble this $600 and win enough to save the car, pay the insurance so I can even drive it, and THEN, maybe then, I can get things turned around. Of course I lose the entire $600 during a 3 day drunken gambling binge. This time however, I get dangerously drunk. I drink anything I can get my hands on. A dangerous mix of non-stop beer, full bottles of wine, vodka, gin...all while alone. I am truly ready to die at this point because of where I have brought myself. No longer having my mom in my life is enough to drive me insane. Then I wake up Sunday afternoon... withdrawing from alcohol. I wake up like I always do in that situation, literally scared for my life and wanting so desperately to live. SO SO SO desperately I want to live. I ended up getting help detoxing from my dad, the entire time thinking I am going to need a hospital. I know a 3 day binge doesn't seem like much, but it was. So here I find myself again, 100% broke, in debt to my eyeballs, only this time with no way to fix it. My car will be repossessed within a few days, and I can't drive it anyways without insurance and expired tags. Doing so would likely land me with real legal consequences, which I have somehow managed to avoid to this point. I lost the new job which was inevitable without having a car to get there. I knew this was going to happen, which is why I gambled again... right? That was my only hope? It honestly might have been this time. But there is the flawed and addicted thinking again. Because of gambling, drinking, poisonous thinking, irresponsibility, I am completely toast. What I will do now I have no earthly idea. It truly wasn't that long ago that I had a real life, good things, and even in debt, I could have been okay, but my disgusting ways of thinking, or my addiction, or my disease, or whatever you want to call it, whatever it is, it lead me here. I don't plan on giving up because I truly do love life, I love my friends, and above everything I love my mom, dad, and sister. I hope this rant possibly helps anyone in these subs that might be fighting whatever it is that they are going through. EVERYTHING will go away if it can't be defeated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-I am currently 6 days sober and 6 days gamble free. Good luck to all.-",

I can do a .3 or .4 shot and feel practically nothing from it. No more euphoria. Just my heart trying to fight its way out of my chest. I still feel depressed after. And distant, and not me. I can feel it, how this time I've lost a part of myself. I have gone where I will never fully come back from. \n\nI for some reason managed to spontaneously get a job while high. Swore I'd sleep it off and go in sober - went in zooted and likely made a jackass of myself. I actually like this job and if my life fall apart again, I dont have it in me to get back up anymore. \n\nAnd i feel so alone. Theres people, sure. But no one close. no one i feel at home with. I miss all my friends. But they're in prison, or out of state, or clean and off to better things, save for one that has no interest in getting clean and is frequently encouraging use. But I love him, hes my little brother, and I'm scared to let him fall to his own devices regardless of how it may eat at me. And we have so much music we've made, so much potential... but he doesnt seem to care. And I'm so defeated. He wont listen. \n\nI only get strung out when alone. I have never been so strung out in my 2 1/2 years. Everything since last October is foggy. I miss my best friend. \n\nI'm scared. This is really just so I can get my thoughts out to SOMEONE. I have been suicidal all my life, until about a year-ish ago. Yet now I want it to stop more than ever. Because it could never be how I wish and I cant change things that are unbearable in my life, and I dont know that I could ever stand to settle for anything else. I'm not good at letting go of things. Of people. Of caring. \n\nI just looked into the mirror, and what I saw, it made me cry. I dont recognize myself, genuinely. That isn't me. The eyes I'm looking into are confused and afraid and pathetic. I'm someone you look at in passing, reacting with disgust and distrust as you cross to the other sidewalk. I look lost. I am lost. My skin is yellowed and blotched with red patches. \n\nHow did I get here\n\nI dont think I'm built to last in this life.",

            "selftext": "What can I do to take my mind off these super intense cravings? I don\u2019t have access to adderall (at least not for the weekend), but it\u2019s all I can think about. The thought of calling the Doctor on Monday and requesting a script is incessant, but the memory of every single suicide attempt I\u2019ve made while on it due to hallucinations because i take so much of it scares me enough at this point to not want to take it... intellectually I know if I order the prescription I\u2019m going to OD again, but physiologically my body is really, really craving the high. \nI had surgery two weeks ago and they gave me Tylenol  3, which of course has codeine; painkillers have never been my preference, but I think they triggered the desire for uppers for sure. I\u2019ve been smoking pot trying to curve the desires, but it\u2019s so damn hard. \nI want to feel high. And even though the hallucinations are terrifying, I kind of want those too. \nPlease, someone, anyone, give me some advice on how to clear my mind - I\u2019ve been trying to distract myself watching tv all day, but clearly it hasn\u2019t worked. \nYesterday, the notion of smoking meth crossed my mind as I looked at my reflection while I smoked weed. Scary thing was that I wasn\u2019t totally turned off by this idea, something I said I\u2019d never do in my lifetime is now something I\u2019m imagining myself doing. Why did I ever take those stupid pills? Why didn\u2019t anybody teach me how to try to focus and work on my own? \nI\u2019d been in denial about my addiction for so long that i couldn\u2019t see it for what it was, but the fact that I\u2019m having these terrible cravings and ideas about switching my drug of choice are clear indicators that I am indeed addicted to pills and am hardcore struggling with sobriety at this point. \n\nDoes quitting smoking cigarettes contribute to the need for drugs? Next week it\u2019ll be a month since I stopped smoking cigs and am thinking this contributes to way I\u2019m feeling lately since I\u2019m the first few weeks I was absolutely amazing. \n\nWriting this has helped tremendously, but I\u2019d still really appreciate some advice or kind words.   Knowing my son graduates in two weeks is a huge factor in staying sober.. and therefore alive. \nI don\u2019t want to die, and I know if there\u2019s a next time I won\u2019t survive it. But the thoughts of just taking a couple of pills are unstoppable. I want to feel hazy and focused and unstoppable and brace and amazing... if there were a certain amount of pills I knew for a fact would give me that feeling without the risk of going to a dark place, I\u2019d drive down to Mexico (I\u2019m about 3 hrs away) and buy some. In the past I\u2019ve had family or friends who live in the border buy me the meds at the pharmacy and just ship them to me, but now that the cat is out of the bag and everyone knows (because I admitted it to them) that I\u2019m a pill popper that\u2019s clearly out of the question.  Earlier today I really considered driving down to the border, crossing the bridge by foot, paying the Doctor the $20 it costs to write a script for a $100-$120 container of thirty pills of Concerta of either 36 or 54 mg  (another amphetamine used to treat ADHD) and just pop two or three to feel really, really good. \n\nI hate being a drug addict, especially to one that was given to me to make life easier. This shit is hard and this weekend has been one of the toughest ones in a while.",

My husband really motivated me to change my life. When we met I knew he was someone I wanted to keep in my life and he was totally straight edge. I knew if I wanted to keep him around I would have to give up that part of my life and I\u2019m happy I did. \n\nOver the years I\u2019ve lost many friends to addiction. The first phone call was the hardest. She was a light in my life and to learn that she had taken her own life because of her struggle was too much to bear. Over the years more phone calls came, and, sadly, they subsequently became easier to deal with. \n\nBut then another heavy hitter came this morning when I learned one of my oldest friends, the person who was with me when I got my first tattoo at the ripe old age of 16, took my first ecstasy pill with at 17, first hit of tweak at 18... has died at the age of 34, found alone on the side of the street in between a couple bushes. \n\nThis friend and I had been best friends in our youth, but lost contact over the years as we both struggled with our own demons. A couple years ago we had reconnected through social media and he told me he was doing well in his recovery, attending church, in dental school, and rebuilding his life. Addiction is a nasty animal and can take a soul back from sobriety at any moment. \n\nI am saddened as humbled today as I remember my friend and remind myself that sobriety is not a guarantee but a battle and a gift we must never take for granted.",

            "selftext": "17 year old here, 18 in 2 months.\n\n\n\nSo since 3 years now i am smoking around 10 bowls of weed a day,most of the time alone and locked in my room.\n\nI have made the biggest step into becoming clean yesterday, throwing away both of my bongs. Now as expected i am really depressive and nostalgic. Im thinking about 3 4 years ago, were my life was pretty much perfect.I was smiling all day and having fun all day. I was in love, had many friends and was very popular... I managed to throw all of this away without even realizing... \n\nWhatever. I was just wondering if i can ever have fun in my life again without doing drugs? At the moment it seems quite impossible.. but  I thought maybe i can learn it again. Maybe i can have fun again in my life. Maybe i can enjoy the little things once again like I used to. I was really optimistic and happy all the time.. Now i cant enjoy my life. I dont have many friends/social life. all I do is regret...\n\n\nDid anyone feel the same like me? Did anyone else have a \"nice\" life but got into drugs and fucked up his life with that? If u did and u now got clean how was it? How was the process of becoming clean? How are u feeling right now? Can u enjoy life again without doing drugs/drinking?",

Found myself really considering it. I mean hey, socializing would be easier.. I'd probably meet more people. Bars and clubs were never my thing, but anything is fun if you're drunk enough, right?\n\nThese thoughts scare the shit out of me. I'm 22, I've got a little bit of sober time. I'm trying to remind myself that I'm a raging alcoholic, to put it nicely. Currently feeling pretty down.. trying to stop myself from saying fuck it lol. Being social helps. I need to meet new people and find new spaces where I can spend my time.\n\nSo if anyone knows any meetings where a lot of young people typically go in the city, or maybe some events/organizations that host events for young addicts.. anything, really. Just trying not to isolate myself. Need to make some new friends. A sincere, big thanks to anyone who read this post. Good luck to you all.",

A job that cherished me and my talents, a good relationship with my family again and some kind of financial stability. I say this while the person Im living with is saying call your employer while I've no called no showed for over a week because who knows! He's about as delusional as I was a few days ago. To make things short I went on a 4 or five day bender and destroyed my life. Drug induced psychosis lead me to think I was about to be arrested and so I crazily called my parents and even went to their house thinking they were my last hope and showed them I hadn't cleaned up my act and said some really disgusting and crazy things. I haven't nor plan to talk to them anytime soon. I'm too ashamed. The same goes for my old employer. Better to move on to something new and less paying than explain my crazy calls as being the result of meth induced psychosis. I've done this enough to know what to do after the fact but dammit I can't believe how quickly I fell into the arms of delusion this time. Thank God for my ex who's put up with my stupid ass throughout the years. If not for him id be on the streets right now in a much worse situation. I owe him more than my family at this point. Anyone reading this it can get better. Just stay away from your drug of choice and do anything to stay away from it. Literally anything. It won't be worth it when you've worked so hard to make everything right again to only see it flushed down the drain in just a few short days.",

It was some sort of local organization that helped addicts recover or find jobs, something like that. I didn\u2019t even pay attention to what specifically it was. The guy was asking everyone for contributions and when he got to me, I jokingly said \u201cnah I\u2019m good, I need money to feed my own addictions\u201d. Definitely a douche move. My bad. \n\nShortly after, my boyfriend and I were talking about getting together tonight and once again I jokingly said \u201chey let\u2019s get shit faced and have fun tonight\u201d to which he replied that he was worried I\u2019ve been drinking and doing too much \u201crelaxing\u201d that way recently. \n\nI do recreationally smoke weed, drink and take other substances. Often all together. Sometimes every night. Not to the point where I get blackout wasted but enough to distract me from my daily stressors. However, Fridays/the weekend? I could forget my name and where I am. But it feels so good in the moment. \n\nHow can I stop before it\u2019s too late? Almost every male in my family has or had a substance addiction. I don\u2019t want to be the next guy to have his life fall apart... things are going pretty good night now in my life. Nice job, nice car, a boyfriend that adores me...idk why all I want to do is get fucking hammered. Even just typing this, I can\u2019t wait to pop a pill and smoke some weed on my way home.",

            "selftext": "She\u2019s battled addiction for years. Pills was the reason I kicked her out the first time. She recovered. We stayed friends for a couple of years.  She lives several states away. \n\nWe were planning on being together again, about a year and two months ago, when she disappeared. I knew it was bad. Sporadic contact for months. I didn\u2019t find out how bad till February. Heroin. \n\nHer family and I managed to get her out. She moved in with her sister and all was going well. She was gaining weight and was beautiful again. Talked about the Hell that heroin was. \n\nA few days ago they brought her back home for a family reunion. She disappeared after an hour and the found her back in the house she used to do heroin in. Claims she went to get some stuff she left. The whole story is shady. Her family gave up on her. It\u2019s either rehab or nothing. Her phone is broke but it doesn\u2019t matter as they won\u2019t talk to her. So she\u2019s on the streets. \n\nI\u2019d gladly take her but the addict she used to run around with is still living 100 ft from me, dealing drugs now along with taking them. She keeps messaging me telling me she didn\u2019t do anything and how she just needs a phone (I did verify with the phone company that it\u2019s broke so at least that\u2019s true) but I know I shouldn\u2019t help. I know that this is what she needs. She refuse to take a drug test and refuses to go to rehab. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just looking for reassurance that I\u2019m doing the right thing. I\u2019m so scared for her. She saved my life once and I feel like I\u2019m killing her. Any advice you can give will be greatly appreciated.",

The addiction wasn\u2019t about me, my ex was a daily meth user for about a year. I broke up with him due to delusions he got where I became afraid for my life. I stopped talking o him for a month where I learned he\u2019d taken a turn for the worse. We had been together 9 years. He became aggressive and physical with his parents, the cops had to be called, his delusions got worse, despite it all I was always there for him. His whole family turned against him, kicking him out. When I mean everyone I mean everyone, from his sisters to any aunt and uncle, no one wanted him at their place. I can\u2019t say I wouldn\u2019t agree with them due to his behavior. He came to stay with me for 3 weeks where he got clean but he missed home and he decided to go back, his parents also allowed him to despite a restraining order. So this is where I\u2019m at now, he\u2019s clean for about 2 months,  he claims he\u2019s so alone and isolated because of the reputation he built while on the drug, but he\u2019s stopped trying to talk to me, which hurts Because he seems to be reaching out to everyone who shunned him except for me. I was always there for him when no one else was. I was the stepping stone to helping him with his sobriety and now I just feel used. We have spoken every here and there but not as I expected to. After years of him being under the influence here he is sober now and wants nothing to do with me and it sucks. I\u2019ve been waiting for him to get sober with the idea that we could work thing out. I\u2019m just so confused and hurt at how he has managed this. I know he\u2019s got a long road to recovery, he\u2019s mentioned how he isn\u2019t in the right head space but even a text here and there would be nice, except I get nothing. He seems to be active on social media, adding the very same people who\u2019ve ignore him for years. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m trying not to be selfish and stupid but I do feel extremely hurt. His family now is so over the moon because he\u2019s better but all thanks to me because I was that little push he needed and now I just feel discarded.",

            "selftext": "I know it\u2019s not one of the toughest addictions, but nonetheless, Im doubtful of how quitting vaping will turnout. I stupidly started underage vaping about a year ago. I am now 17, still underage, and am COMPLETELY hooked. \n\nVaping is screwing me up. Ever since I\u2019ve started, my life\u2019s been slowly getting more and more fucked up. My grades are terribly low, (before vaping I usually had a 3.8-4.0 gpa, now I\u2019m down to less than 2.0) I\u2019ve developed depression, been prescribed multiple antidepressants, and have been seeing a therapist. On top of all that, nothings working. Why? Its the vaping. Well, I\u2019m sure there are other factors contributing to all this as well, but I know most of it is directly due to vaping. Oh, and it\u2019s also taking all my money as well.  Anyways, to sum it up, nicotine is fucking me up.  \n\nObviously, I want to quit. The thing is, I can\u2019t. In fact, I\u2019ve tried quitting multiple times before. (My most \u201csuccessful\u201d attempt lasted about a week, until I hit my friends JUUL and relapsed.) On top of being physically addicted, I also enjoy doing it. I like the different devices and flavors, and, well, just doing it in general. All of my friends do it as well, and it\u2019s practically impossible to get away from it. If I somehow do quit, I can\u2019t trust myself to not do it with friends. \n\nSo former nicotine addicts, how did you quit? How do I stop myself from vaping with my friends? I need to get my life back together soon, and any advice would be appreciated. Thank you.",

When we first started dating, we almost broke up because I reached out to his friends and his dad because I was concerned for him but didn't realize it was him drinking. Like typical alcoholics do, he got mad, blamed me, manipulated the circumstances. \n\nThen, more shit happened. And then we got better. \n\nYou see, he's a functioning alcoholic. A teacher. A brilliant brilliant man. \n\nI don't blame him for his need to feel numb. I don't. I get it. I want to feel that too sometimes. \n\nWhat he doesn't know... a few weeks ago in the ICU, we took a teacher, not much older than him, an alcoholic, off of life support. I also cared for another alcoholic who went into cardiac arrest. And another whose heart was only beating 10% of what he needed, and was going down the pathway of needing a transplant.... if he could get sober. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recorded boy tonight for a minute. And sent it to him. We did this to my dad. It still didn't work. What made my dad get sober? Getting drunk at \\*my\\* college party with my department, and trying to drive home while I was on a date. I had to forcefully stop him while my mom was on her way to pick him up. He gave me bruises that night. \n\nI recorded boy and sent it to him, and sent him a message (because he's so passed out right now) that he is terrifying me. I would do anything to help him, but I know he has to want it and do it for himself. I know no matter what he says, until he does it, words don't matter. \n\nWhen I approached my dad with my mom, I was so angry, and hurt, that it was absolutely no problem for me to set boundaries and yell and scream and cut him out of my life (even though my parents were still married, and still are). It was okay  to hate him. But I can't hate boy. No matter how much he hurts me. \n\nThey say children of alcoholics become nurses a lot. And nurses are co-dependent. \n\nI'm seeing a counselor for some of my own PTSD (yay for critical care nurses -- oh, and I'm a sexual assault nurse, so I see some fucking horrible things people do to one another in all areas -- who have PTSD rates at the same rate as combat veterans). And I'm going to see her next week hopefully. \n\nBut I don't know what to do now. I don't know how to tell him tomorrow scares me. \n\nI didn't want to leave, I wanted to have the conversation first thing in the morning. But my stomach was so upset. \n\nSorry for the rambling. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Nurse, daughter of alcoholic (recovering for 12? years now), and girlfriend of alcoholic. Don't know what to do anymore, and my heart is breaking as I write this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay, I know what I need to do. I need to set boundaries. I need to set limits. I need to speak to him when he's sober. But I don't know how to go about doing this. Because I don't want to give up on him. I don't want to make him feel like I won't be there for him. I don't know how to ask him to start going to counseling and meetings.",

            "selftext": "I remember our trip to the lake house so perfectly, so horribly, so vividly.  My shoulder resting in the hollow pocket of yours as we sat on the deck under the stars.  My daughter asleep in bed.  Listening to the sounds of peaceful bliss.  In my mind, sipping wine, bellies full from a wonderful first night's dinner at the restaurant overlooking the lake, everything was perfect.  We sat and talked under the red fleece blanket, watching the stars rise above the horizon over our heads.  Nothing was wrong. \n\nThen everything went wrong.\n\nAs we repeated our ritual of snuggles and talks, you unleashed the first piece of the puzzle that was unexpectedly going to unravel.  A million pieces to that puzzle.  Each piece dropping on me as if I were standing, obviously, under a cinderblock suspended by rope.  You were holding the rope.\n\nOn that night, the corner piece of the puzzle, that shattered my seemingly perfect world, was that you were snorting heroin.  Daily.\n\nThe breath fled from my lungs as that first cinderblock came crashing down.  My mind bolted up the stairs, immediately considering the beautiful, perfect, six year old girl sleeping in the quilted twin bed of that lake house.\n\nBut I knew I loved you.  Your honesty in those moments meant so much to me.  Your raw, vulnerable honesty.  Later, I would come to understand that your raw emotions would be shielded by a defensive wall and your honesty would give-way to impulsive lying, but the vulnerability would not fade.  In that moment of realness you put a piece of yourself out there to me which could never be taken back.  You had shown me your cards.  You could ask for a new hand, but these were the cards you were dealt and nothing could take back the realness and vulnerability that truth exposed.  I often feel as though you are resentful for showing me your hand .\n\nBut I knew I loved you.  And even after you had exposed yourself in that raw, honest and vulnerable moment, I respected you. \nYou had my love and respect, but now you needed my support.  My mind raced like the wings of a million moths in the darkness of that night.  Frantically stammering back and forth, without making a sound.  I knew in my heart you didn't need criticism or judgment; I knew you needed love and support.\n\nAs my mind reeled over the information, I quickly settled on the fact that loving and supporting you through to the other side was EXACTLY what I was prepared to do. In front of me sat a compassionate, remorseful man, who along life's journey had f*cked up.  A man who showed deep care and consideration toward me.  A man whose love I genuinely felt deeply to my soul.\n\nI read.  I read every article, journal, personal experience and ounce of information I could find on: heroin, heroin addiction, heroin treatment, heroin recovery, opioid addiction, relationships with an addict in recovery, opioid and heroin withdrawal, what to expect after heroin withdrawal, heroin and opioid relapse statistics, success stories, and the list goes on.\n\nOver the next two days I began to despise that first floor bedroom.  The one where we had only so very recently enjoyed so much pleasure.  I despised not sleeping next to you as I laid awake in the upstairs master bedroom, my deadpan stare drifting across the lake.  The moths in my head swarmed faster, angrier, exhausted.  I was looking for a solution.  There wasn't one.\n\nThat red fleece blanket.  That red fleece blanket that now smelled of stale cigarettes as you smoked inside the lake house on the couch.  That red fleece blanket that could do no justice in getting your cold, sweating body to stop shaking.  That red fleece blanket you twisted between your restless legs as you barked at me for not being able to rub you to sleep.  That damned red fleece blanket that I could not have been happier to throw into the washing machine, until I walked through the basement and caught sight of the remote.  A staring contest ensued between me and that remote.  The remote that concealed a lie which would change my life forever. \n\nEvery night my mind would bounce between hope and hopelessness. When the tears rolled down my cheeks and the hopelessness felt like acid eating away the flesh, I would smother them.  Remembering my indignant devotion to give you the love and support you deserved.\n\nYou wanted this.  You were caring and compassionate.  You were appreciative.  You loved me. And through the months I held on to the feeling I had in that moment to get me through.  To get you through.  I believed that compassionate, honest, caring and appreciative man, who loved me enough to touch my soul, would be there on the other side.\n\nSo I wait.\n\nI wait with baited breath and a clenched jaw as every resented day passes.  A struggle between hope and hopelessness.   The glimmers of hope fewer and farther between like those stars overhead on the deck, slowly passing by.  \nI wait for that man.  That raw, vulnerable and honest man.  The man I so desperately want as my partner.  I wait for that man to show.\n\nBut now he never will.\n\n\nI wrote this story, with exception of the last line, six weeks ago.  16 days ago my boyfriend passed away from an intentional overdose after 8 months clean.",

            "selftext": "I wright here to others addicts lots of nice strong thoughts to help them,help anyone who read this very helpfull sub. Anyways, I try to stay positive, i give positive forward as much as I can, I was one of real junkies, real \"deep in\" addict of heroin. I used it for 5 years withouth pouse, and I used it a lot, like 5grams per day. For my weight and health (I'm in general very thin) that was the end. \nBut that is not the point now, I'm writing here and hope someone feels the same and understands what I'm going thro..\nI decided to get clean last year on December. I have had 2 colapes till now, otherwise I try to stay hard and clean. Now it is five months, I'm clean of everything but I think I'm getting to the point to colapes a bit harder.\nFrom december to today I have had nothing but bad luck. I had accident and had big operation on my hand (now is made out of titan), the irony is that the one thing I loved doing in my life (beside drugs) was playing piano-so that is gone. I was staying at home from work (I was a chef-second favorite thing to do-cooking) and they decided, I'm no good for them anymore because of my not funkcion hand. On January my mom landed in hospital, have had 5 operations on lever, heart...every single inside organ was taken from her and she is only 54 years. I was sure, I lost her. After we brought her home, one week later my father fell on job and broke his ribs and beck,and I'm like daddys girl so I landed again in hospital. They both lost jobs due to health. I'm dieing inside to see them so broke, so ill and I have nothing to help them. I lost everything to. I lost my car, my insurance,my job,friends,all the money and I still owe banks and sh**. Then when I thought that is the lowes point I can be at, my fatherinlow had an hearth attack. Someone drove my cat to death infront of my home. Anyway,the point is I'm much more lower then on rock bottom.\nToday I can only think about being high,forget all my problems and just get high as hell... it has been 5 months and I still feel pain in mornings, I feel depreson and it is like I used it last week but I really didn't. I was trying- STILL AM- to stay clean and positive but someone tell me why?\nUntil I was addict everything was on its own place, I was working,helped my parents.. I stoped because I believed it will be the best thing for me,but most the best thing for people who really loves me-they don't deserve a junky.. but as I say...I think something trying to bring me down for real,and I'm so positive person,I always help others and stand them before me. Even when I was a junky I never did something to hurt other humanbeing.\nI just want to send massage to someone to get me stuff,but I reather went write here and say what is on my mind... I just feel so down,so alone, so bed... I'm trying my best but it still doesn't work,so what is the point?\nI'm sorry for being so long, I just needed to tell someone,to get it out... thank you for reading,means really a lot to me \u2764",

I had a very bad addiction to heroin. At the end of it, I was using grams a day. Doing the worst stuff to get my fix. It was disgusting. I feared my actions would kill my mother. She loved me through all of it and I used her as much as I could. My health deteriorated to the point I died. Brought back thankfully. Sepsis, collapsed lungs, failing heart, failed kidneys, etc. ICU for weeks, in hospital for a month recovering. Pain pump full of Dilaudid that did nothing due to tolerance. Talks of open heart surgery. I was getting my drugs brought in while I was dying in bed. That is until I finally broke down and came clean to one of my nurses. Her brother is an addict. She understood. From that point, she fought with me. I was able to see an addiction doctor and other specialists that helped me get off the opiates. Change happened. I wanted to live my life finally and not wither away and die.\n\nFast forward 9 months. I'm still clean. Health is massively improved. Heart condition under control. I have a job. I'm going to school to become a nurse. I have a girlfriend that I love. I enjoy life to the fullest every day. I shouldn't be here, but thanks to loving and caring medical professionals, I get a second chance. I never thought I would have the strength to stay clean like this.\n\nThere is hope. If you want it, you CAN do it. I wake each day now and smile. I don't have to die from drugs and that's the biggest gift I could ever imagine for myself.",

            "selftext": "My brother has struggled with with drug addiction since we were in our mid teens. First it was opiates, then benzos, and more recently, meth. Over the past 10 years, he\u2019s totally destroyed my family. Aunts and uncles have moved to different cities because of him. Both my older brother and I have essentially estranged ourselves because of him. Everything of value has been stolen and pawned. Power tools, wedding rings, furniture, video games, and even groceries. Literally everything.\n\nMy mother has more or less been his prisoner for a decade. She won\u2019t press charges, and she won\u2019t ignore him because she\u2019ll blame herself when (not if) something happens to him, not to mention his suicide threats every time he she doesn\u2019t give him what he wants. She\u2019s lived in destitute poverty because she pays his car note (that he forced her to co-sign). She gives him \u201cgas money\u201d than she needs for her own bills. Sure she\u2019s enabling him. She knows that. But when he ends up dead, she\u2019ll find ways to lame herself, and I don\u2019t think she could cope with that.\n\nHe\u2019s always been cruel and selfish, but his addictions turned him into a truly vile person. As soon as I graduated high school, I moved as far away as I could and haven\u2019t ever looked back.\n\nAnyway, my point for saying all this is that for the first time in a long time, I actually think he has an opportunity to step back and think about what he\u2019s done. He\u2019s been arrested at least a dozen times and spent many weeks in jail, but he\u2019s never had any charges that stuck, despite my best efforts. He\u2019s never had anyone who wouldn\u2019t bail him out or at least take his calls. For now though, everyone\u2019s sick of him. No one is going to help him, and no one is falling for his lies that he\u2019s sorry or that he\u2019ll go to rehab.\n\nHe\u2019s going to prison, and this will be the first time he\u2019ll have been sober for more than a month since he was at least 15. I know the odds probably aren\u2019t in his favor for any kind of long term recovery, but at least now there\u2019s reason to hope that there\u2019s a chance.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I can do anything for him, and he\u2019s already exhausted the resources of an entire family who held out hope for far too long. If anyone has any experience or stories about a loved one who seemed utterly hopeless, please share them with me.\n\nI refuse to enable him any more, but please let me know if you have ideas of what I can do while he\u2019s in prison or prepare for when he gets out. This may be the best shot he ever has at turning things around, so I really want to try and make the most of it.",

I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any other subreddits to post this to, but I would appreciate suggestions greatly as I would like to hear as much advice as possible. As the title says - for about two years I\u2019ve been smoking weed daily and I am one of the few individuals who experience withdrawals from THC(the 10% of chronic weed smokers). Similarly, I started drinking heavy about a year ago and since I\u2019ve recently turned 21, and I don\u2019t think I can name a night I go without some sort of alcohol whether it\u2019s beer to whiskey.\n\nA few of the issues that I\u2019m well aware of are that I have an addictive personality, definitely suffer from depression and anxiety (since around 17). Once I start any vice, I feel the urge to not stop and I just don\u2019t want to. I constantly want to drink and smoke until I crash and it ends up being a daily routine even though I tell myself I don\u2019t want it to be and know I don\u2019t want it to be like that. \n\nOne last thing maybe worth mentioning is that I believe I\u2019m highly addicted to nicotine too. Started experimenting with cigarettes at 16 and once I turned 18 and moved out on my own, I realized how much I love nicotine and experience heavy withdrawals if I start going a few days without it. I used chantix and got off for awhile but got one of the vape nic hitters and recently have started smoking cigs again. Again, I know how bad this is for me.\n\nI know this might seem minor compared to the more serious and real issues that exist but I just need some direction and don\u2019t know anyone I can talk to personally, even though I have tried.",

I am not thinking completely clearly currently. \n\nI learned in recovery many years ago that drugs were not the problem, I am the problem.\n\nWell. I'm still the problem. I have struggled in relationships with having a different understanding of fulfilling intimate relationships than all the women I have dated. While I continue to be close, and draw myself closer, sharing with them things I wouldn't tell anyone else, I do stop having a sex drive with my partner. I feel safe and secure in the relationship, but I want the next thing. I continue to work on my relationship, but have sex with others. I am in an open relationship, but my partner is having difficulty with this because we are not having sex. She feels betrayed.\n\nI have taken tests for hormone levels. They came back fine. And so I went back to my therapist that I had for years and spoke to her. We tried several different methods to perhaps boost my libido and my sexual attraction to my partner, and nothing worked. She came to the conclusion that I am wired differently because in my youth, 7 to 16, I used drugs. I need to get to that next level. I spoke with my partner about this conclusion, and while she was not happy with this, she agreed to continue to work on the relationship. I have done everything else I can think of to show her she is loved deeply by me and that I am wholly invested in this relationship and that intimacy is still possible. I have not continued to work on this aspect of our relationship, and I am now seeing the damage it is causing. I want that to change. \n\nWhat am I missing?

However, two days later I was swallowing all my pills to the point that I consumed everything just to have it out the house. No more kratom for me! I was clearly chasing a substitute high.\n\nI've also been going to gym more, but when I skip gym for just one day, I get these awful, guilty, anxious feelings that feel so similar to my drug cravings. I often feel an overwhelming desire to use my anti-anxiety meds when this happens.\n\nI have A LOT more money in my bank account, so I've been spending my money on things like clothes, video games, food, social events and travel... Now the thing is, I have even less money now than I did while I was abusing substances.\n\nIf I don't get a good vegetable intake for a single day, I drive myself insane with guilt and get those drug-ish cravings again.\n\nThis whole experience is driving me mad. I thought I was addicted to alcohol and stimulants, but I don't think that was it. I could be addicted to anything, and it sucks.\n\nBut it's okay. I just felt like sharing my feelings.",

Meaning I have used heroin every single day for the past four years with the exception of maybe 30 days or so of not using during that four year period. I have been on pain pills and opiates in general off and on for about 15 years. Well anyway after countless times of trying (Desperately I may add) to kick this habit once and for all I have decided to go and obtain help. I called the Clinic and within two hours I was there within 3 days I was recieving my first dose of \ud83c\udf52 flavored Methadone. Which I may add tastes fucking disgusting. Anyway I'm on 75 mgs of Methadone I have gained about 12 pounds and have started to receive one day a week takehomes. All in about 32 days. I can go up to 90 milligrams before I have to see the doctor. My wds are gone I feel great I know for at the least 28 hours after dosing I've never been longer than that . I still have cravings and I have still used. The way my doctor talks once I reach my theraputic dose I won't even think about using. We will see. Any advice or knowledge you can kick me is much appreciated. Thanks",

            "selftext": "***\\* This is a short work I made regarding belief systems, a concept that I think could seriously help a lot on the journey to recovery. Please take the time to read, it will only take five to ten minutes, and I can guarantee it will give you some value. Thanks\\****   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBelief systems are the lens by which we view the world. They are without a doubt, one of the most powerful tools which we can use in order to make positive changes in our own lives. Yet, many people are unaware of their existence, or underestimate the power that they can hold. In this short piece, I want to go over the very basics of belief systems, and explain how one can use, alter, and discover belief patterns in order to make positive lasting changes in their own life.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What is a Belief System? \n\n  \nBelief systems are simply a way in which we view certain things. We can have belief systems about the world as a whole, about money, about food, or ourselves. There are good and bad belief systems, some will help us live a happy, successful and healthy life, while others will lead us down dark paths, and create nothing but havoc for us. Recognising our own belief systems, and determining if they are good or bad, is a key skill which we need to have, if we are too make lasting changes in any area of our own lives. Lets look at an example of both a good (positive) belief system, and a bad (negative) belief system.  \n\nImagine there are two people, Mike and Sarah. They are both severely overweight, and recognise that if they do not change their ways then they will soon find themselves either extremely sick, or dead. In response to these thoughts, both decide to go on a diet and start exercising. The night before their new regime is set to begin, they both look themselves in the mirror and talk to themselves.\u00a0 Mike tells himself \"You are fat and lazy, you always have been. This diet and exercise plan is never going to work, you love food too much. You hate exercise, and you have never stuck to anything in your life, this is going to be so tough\". While Sarah tells herself \"Okay Sarah, this new regime is going to be tough, but you can do it. You hate being fat, you hate being unhealthy, and nothing will feel better than proving to yourself you can do it. You will love all the new meals you will be able to eat, and exercise will be fun and rewarding.\"  \n\nNow ask yourself who has the better chance at succeeding? Sarah obviously, but why? \n\nWell its clear that Sarah is in a much more positive mindset about the whole thing, and she is encouraging herself, whereas Mike is putting himself down and doubting himself already. This is because both of them are using belief systems, but Sarah's are constructive positive belief systems, while Mike's are negative and harmful.  \n\nLets break down each belief system in part.  \n\nMike first of all says that he is \"fat and lazy\". He has the belief that this is all he is, he can't change it, it is part of who he is. He then tells himself \"diet and exercise is never going to work\" which immediately makes the task 100x harder. If he (the person who will be performing the action) believes that it is not going to work, then what chance has he got? He then finishes himself off with two nasty remarks; \"I love food\" and \"I hate exercise\". His belief systems are set. He will not change, because he is not the guy who will change. He is the guy who loves everything he should not, and hates everything he should love.  \n\nSarah on the other hand, adopts some more positive belief systems. She first of all reinforces that she can do it, no matter how tough, reminding herself that she is the type of person who can see tough things through. She says that she \"hates being fat, and unhealthy, and cannot wait to exercise and eat new healthy foods.\" Her belief\u00a0 systems are wildly different from Mike's, yet she is no different too him physically, however she will clearly have a better chance at completing her regime than Mike, but why is this? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Words Make The Difference \n\nWhen we tell ourselves things, no matter what they may be, our minds react and store this information. The words we use, no matter how insignificant they may seem, are actually reviewed by our brain as it hears them, and recognises words that are used often. The more times we use a word, the more our brain becomes used to it. And often times we will relate emotions to these words. Words are powerful, but mix them with emotion and we have something special. Our brains will listen and act upon the words they hear, especially when they are said often, and with emotion. We will literally become what we say, or what we think about, if we say or think it enough. This works both ways, either too our benefit, or too our demise. Too the recovering drug addict who thinks about taking one little hit, his mind will react differently depending on what it has been told. If the addict has said repeatedly that \"I am a recovering drug addict and I just wish I could do drugs again, but I know I shouldn't\" then this drug addicts mind will tell them its okay too do a little bit of drugs. You are the type of person who wishes he could do drugs, so you more likely than not, will. However, if your belief systems surrounding drugs was \"I am a former drug addict who has got his life clean and hates even the sight of drugs\" then you will be far more likely to turn drugs away, why? Because that is not who you are, it does not coincide with your belief systems.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Who are You? \n\nSo ask yourself this; what belief systems are you currently holding, regarding the most important things in your life? How do you think about your health? Your impulses? Your family? Write them down, the most important five at least. Be honest with yourself, do not even try and lie, you will not even fool yourself. Once you have them down, look at them, and ask yourself one final question; \"*IS THIS WHO I WANT TO BE?*\" If not then change it, put one big score through your old belief and write down your new one. Embrace it, feel it. Say it aloud, day and night, mix it with emotion, however you can. But ultimately become that new you. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen your actions, words and thoughts become aligned then you will have succeeded. And only you can make that happen.",

            "selftext": "Title says it all. I'm 25/F and for basically the past 8 years have been addicted to purchasing coffee on the go, however without explicitly realizing it. Ironically, I used to work as a barista for years, and would still purchase coffee on my days-off from work. It has become a problem for my wallet but also my happiness. At my last office job, I would buy a small coffee every single day. I could have brought coffee to work, but there's something exciting about buying it. I waste so much money buying coffee and I feel somewhat depressed during the day if I don't drink it. I know in my right mind that the coffee is filling some void that I should work on by myself without depending on a substance. I guess I'm asking for advice here and to see if anyone has had a similar situation and overcome it. Thanks in advance :\\]",

            "selftext": "I(M) live with my mother and little sister. I relapsed on meth nearly a month ago (clean 3 yrs), and they both knew about it. But my mother thinks I've been clean for a week because I've learned to be (slightly) high functioning, and i use drug induced insomnia as an excuse for never sleeping. We are all very broke and struggling to pay bills and food, well they are broke because I just got $700 for a gold chain I found in my closet. My mum she stays up crying because she needs to sell her belongings that she worked hard for all her life, while im spending money I could have used to put an end to her crying and depression on meth. Her body hurts from years of abuse staying up all night to do physical labor so we can barely scrape by, yet while im sleeping off my comedown she is deep cleaning the house we are about to lose and making everything beautiful. I am such a piece of shit and I dont know what to do about it.\n\nMy sister, she's running away and will not come home, she wants her friends mom to have partial custody because she can get away with whatever there, and it hurts my mom badly. She cries to me about it. But I yell at her when she gets mad too easily. I understand the stress yet I continue to yell at my own mother and once again, she is crying. I am lucky to have a mother let alone a great one and here I am hurting her and throwing away my opportunities to stop her pain. She gives me smokes when I cant afford them, or more so when I'm spending my money on fucking drugs so I can come home and ask for a smoke. She will sigh because she knows she can't afford it, but she knows I will have to go collect butts and she doesn't like to see that.\n\nSo here I am, awake while she is sleeping, coming down from the euphoria that I dont deserve and my mother does. Worst of it, I throw away every opportunity I have to give it to her, and give it to myself instead. And I am aware of it all, so why do I keep doing it? Good question. Maybe my fellow peers can give me some different perspectives. What should I do now? Should I tell her about everything, even though it will hurt her as deep as it did years ago when she couldnt sleep because of me? Should I just quit and not tell her? Should I just accept that I dont deserve her and that Im just too far gone as a piece of shit to admit it and keep pushing it to the back of my head? Just looking for opinions, I have rough ones about myself so im sure I can take yours. Just can't stop thinking about how lucky I am to have all of this. I have seen the shitty side and it isnt something I want to see again, so I have no idea why I do this over and over. Sorry about shitty whatever, on nearly 80 hours no sleep so grammar errors are inevitable.  \n\nSincerely, some stupid kid with privileges he takes too much advantage of.",

It then lead to me drinking one during every test which led to me getting slightly higher toleration.\n\nAfter a while i made it a little tradition to drink a monster during math class on fridays as a fun thing, \n\nThis made me go from one energy drink every two weeks to atleast one a week and sometimes two if i had a test. \n\nThen one week i had to work everyday after school and i had almost a test a day. This made me drink 5 drinks that week and i also went to bed way too late \n\nEver since that week ive been drinking 2-4 energy drinks a week, and coffe! I believe this is an issue that i could probably just take care of but its already reached the stage where i just dont feel really awake without coffein. I skate a lot (several hours everyday) which is very energy demanding so i can barlely go an hour skating without caffeine (intensive trick practice). I really dont know what to do, ive already drank one drink today, i have one in my pocket and one in my locker. From time to time i have up to 4 drinks in my locker. \n\nShould i quit, tone it down or is sugar really the issue here? During the summer i imagine ill consume a lot less so thats good",

So far they've only lasted a few minutes each time, but they are happening at different times of the day, not just at night when I would normally use.  Over the past 3 months I've only had one or two, but I feel the urge creeping back in which for me is typical at this stage of recovery.  \n\nThis attempt has been a bit different.  I have switched jobs (from service industry) and started going back to school.  I live in a dry house.  I work out daily, am in an IOP 2x a week and also individual counselling.  I've reconnected with friends and family. So far, things have turned around in a profound way in a short period and the future seems promising.  Despite that, I can't help but think how great going on a little bender would be, setting up the chemistry set again and chasing the dragon for a little while.  It sucks, I hope it is fleeting PAWS.

He has had 1 relapse and a few slips here and there. He goes a few weeks or months and out of no place he uses. Maybe I\u2019m wrong but I have told him I know this is a life long struggle and I will be here to support him but he can\u2019t lie to me. Am I completely delusional to think he will ever be honest about this? Or to think that him slipping less and less is a positive sign? I am not stupid I know one slip can lead into a full relapse but I am just wondering if accepting it in this way is more harmful or helpful. Advise please",

There is only one person that I do it with and that is my sister.\n\nI have tried to stop multiple times but she is very emotional and seems to get really upset. She doesn\u2019t see the destruction it causes. We both still live at home, we have little to no social life, she has not finished college (she is turning 26) and I have not started, we are both socially awkward, and even worse is that we are both overweight.\n\nShe has a lot of issues going on with her that I feel like are mini addictions but she gets angry with me if I bring them up to her. Sometimes I wake up and she is constantly doing tarot card readings about the same things. Our room is a mess, we rat out constantly, but it is just so awkward to try and stop because when I talk to my sister as her, I don\u2019t mesh with her that well. Things about her just annoy and confuse me.\n\nWhen she goes to work, I find that I am more productive, aside from other things that I try to work on. When I am around she feels like a leech on my energy. I don\u2019t know what to do because when I try to stop life feels harder, but I hate watching time go by so fast.\n\nI only have two friends and that is my sister and my boyfriend.

Ive taken off a week of work to have him over, where i will be watching over him making sure he stays clean. He\u2019s a very close friend of mine, and although this situation makes me uncomfortable, he means the world to me and i want to help any way i can. I guess I\u2019m just looking for advice on what to expect for the next week. Ive done some light research and watched some documentaries, but any additional advice i can receive would be great for me, as Ive been fortunate enough to have never dealt with this personally. Please wish my friend Gary good luck, and keep him in your thoughts and prayers. My biggest fear is that this withdrawal will kill him, and i just don\u2019t know how to approach this. Thank you again for any advice you can send my way.",

It was actually great for a little bit, I stayed away from dope for a little while, but last Thursday I picked up some G. Crystal isnt even my DOC either which is really fucking with me, My main DOC is fentanyl/heroin. I just wish I could get back on track and not be a fuck up. Was doing so well, family starting to trust me again. I cant let them find out but then again who am I kidding. If you're reading this and you're thinking about doing hard drugs because of the current status of drugs in the younger generations culture just don't, I know how it sounds and you don't want to hear it. It might be fun for a week or two, and then shit hits the fan quick and you'll realize. The shear amount of stealing and lying you will do to the people you love is actually out of this world. (Stole probably upwards a grand from my mothers side of the family) and this is the hardest thing to cope with.  The opiate problem is out of control right now and its extremely sad how many lives it taking in its destructive wake, lol and keep in mind my grandpa and uncle both die from suicide/overdose because of meth/heroin. At the end of the day its nobodys fault but mine and i think a lot of addicts have a tough time admitting that. There always some underlying excuse you tell yourself your tell others. This life is nothing but toxic and i sincerely would not wish this on my worst enemy. \n\n\\- Sooberly.",

Got social anxiety last summer and couldn\u2019t stand it, so I started to use codeine and tramadol the days I worked to be able to make it through the day. \n\nObviously it only got worse the days i were clean, my training and mental health suffered bad. Been on tramadol and codeine last year most of the time. Been taking breaks but every time i worked a weekend i got really bad anxiety and poped som opioid. \n\nSo I got a summer without work, until the next semester at the university. Three months to focus on training and not take any drugs. Flushed everything down, been clean for 10 days now. \n\nMy girlfriend is mad however, think i should work. \u201dJust take some SSRI and make some money\u201d. I feel so much relief. Don\u2019t care about that my girlfriend is mad and my parents will be disappointed that i don\u2019t \u201dwant to work\u201d this summer.\n\nEdit: To be clear, i only get social anxiety on that work.

He refuses to see a counselor long term because it\u2019s \u201ctoo upsetting.\u201d\n\nHe smokes weed every night, and during the day on weekends. He will use cocaine sporadically (maybe ten times a year) when with certain friends. He previously had an rx for tramadol which he took improperly (hoarding pills for when he was really \u201cbad\u201d rather than taking as prescribed. It took months to wean off them.) He has an rx for Ativan that he takes as needed, and usually runs out of by the end of the month. He will often ask friends with pain killer rxs for a few pills if he feels any sort of pain (for example, after running a race, his muscles were sore. He sought out Vicodin.) He has a very low pain tolerance and will generally seek out drugs rather than feeling any discomfort.\n\nHe recently started Prozac and, after three weeks, decided to take himself off of it. He started experiencing general malaise and joint pain and has been unable to sleep. He got suboxone from a friend and took that to try and take the edge off. The joint pain has returned and he is reacting very poorly - crying, shaking, getting so worked up he\u2019s making himself puke.\n\nHe refuses to see a doctor because he knows he will fail a drug test and believes it will negatively impact his life (lose his job, lose his prescription for Ativan.)\n\nHe is currently crying and miserable and begging me for help. I think he is nearing a mental break and we need to go to the doctor immediately, which he refuses. I don\u2019t know what to do - I told him if he\u2019s not going to go to the doctor I\u2019m not going to be able to help him, but feel that may have been too harsh. I don\u2019t know how to impress upon him how serious this is.",

            "selftext": "I decided to check back in on reddit, completely forgetting what I had initially used it for until I opened the app back up. \nI used to seek through reddit the answers for a better life. I sought out others for knowledge and insight on the kind of brain I had, coped the way I did, and the validation that I wasn\u2019t alone in whatever the hell was consuming me. Although I found that there were many who suffered like me, that wasn\u2019t enough. \n  I hoped for someone to tell me the secret to life and how to live it again without the chains of addiction to hold me back. I didn\u2019t know what that looked like or what that would in tell but nothing I had tried had worked, so here I was. Desperate and hopeless. I\u2019d do anything I could to not feel this way. \n\nThe twist to this was that I could not do anything at the time. I wasn\u2019t equipped with any tools, any tips and tricks. I was convinced I would die a sudden death and that the clock could only tick for so long. I continued to incapacitate my poor body. I wouldn\u2019t skip a beat in clapping to the song that would play at my funeral. I continuously opened the gates of hell- the gates that would soon shut on me if I didn\u2019t find a solution. \n\nFebruary 26th I had unknowingly found my solution.. \nYou found a malnourished, sleep deprived, drunken, \u201cself will run riot\u201d little girl in the midst of her demolished house hold, panicking at the wreckage that surrounded me. \u201cHow did I get here? Is this even real?\u201d \nConfusion and derealization clouded my mind as the intake tech questioned me of my drug of choice, mental state, and current financial situation over the phone. \u201cIs this person really even on the phone?\u201d It didn\u2019t matter. I was answering every question with a sense of desperation in my voice. I was hungry and starved. But, for what? It most definitely was not food. \n\nThe scene falls down around me and I find myself on an airplane on my way to the Hill Country in Texas; to what I\u2019d call home for the next 50 days. \n I sat between two grown men who seemingly had my anxiety sky rocketing because of their closeness. That\u2019s okay, though. I have this liquid courage to help calm the nerves, unaware and denying that this would be my last hoorah. Getting drunk on planes was more fun anyways. I\u2019ll cheers to that. \n\n Exiting the plane, I quickly realize how far away from home, Memphis, Tennessee, I truly was. \u201cMy son and husband won\u2019t have me for thirty days. I can\u2019t leave them. That is selfish. They need me right now.\u201d\n Little did I know I was about to be exactly where they ACTUALLY needed me to be. \n\nAt Starlite Recovery Center. Smack dab in the middle of a little town called Center Point..",

It's simply not worth the paranoia, schizophrenia, and torment that eventually comes to everyone who uses it. That being said, I know it'll be far from easy staying away from it after getting a taste, but I'm convinced that to do it again means to die, so it's off the table completely. I simply must set my mind on a stoic enduring of life's difficulty without considering drugs as an escape route. So here we go, onward.",

            "selftext": "For anyone interested, here's my story and a few thoughts on recovery in the last section of my \"sermon\" lol.\n\nApril 2014 after 14 months of recovery, I relapsed after I steadily stopped going to as many meetings and focused more on work. I had convinced myself it was mind over matter, and within a week I was back to my old alcoholic way of drinking and it got worse from there. Back to the old endless thought of, I can drink today and stop tomorrow, on and on. Got very sick, and really the only thing that gave me a window of opportunity to take action was how fast my tolerance went up, how difficult it was to hold down alcohol, food, water, anything, and on May 26th somewhere in the midst of an 18 pack of Coors of all things, I had my last one.\n\nMay 27th 2014 was 5 years ago already, and in that time I've turned all my old chips in, worked the steps, earned them all back and then some. While still detoxing, about a week after my sobriety date at 31 years of age I started a new journey in school, summer session, \"psychology 1\" in Community College. I worked very hard in school, I took no short cuts, I sat up front and took notes, I did well, and I stayed sober. The summer of year one was a hard one as my dear friend, a girl I might have married had things turned out a little different, Michelle, died due to organ failure caused by alcoholism at 36 years old. I was able to be by her side that night at the hospital because I was sober, may she rest in peace. That week following, I completed step 12 with my sponsor, and I carried on in school. A lot has happened since then, I got to prove to myself that I wasn't that F student high school drop out anymore over the years to come and I stayed sober a day at a time. In that time I earned two associate degrees, one even in \"alcohol and drug studies\" if you can believe that, which I think is hilarious. I transferred to my top choice 4 year university and studied there, and then I graduated with a bachelors in psychology last year.\n\nMy father was diagnosed with advanced lung cancer from smoking last year not long before I graduated, and he got to be there at that ceremony, it meant the world to both of us I think, and my Mom too, even my sponsor was there. I sat right next to another member of this very fellowship at that commencement, we took classes together from community college through university, and we both graduated that day summa cum laude, not bad for a couple of alcoholics. Now she's in a masters of marriage and family therapy program at her top choice grad school, and I'm in a master of social work program at my top choice grad school at an internationally recognized tier 1 research university, with one year left to go. I am pursuing my dreams and a future that I never would have never had, had I not been an alcoholic and worked the steps of this recovery program. I love the life recovery has given me today, and I intend to make the most of it. I just hope that maybe you, or maybe someone new, can read my story and find some hope, because when I came in I never thought I'd be a person to take a birthday chip someday. Actually I thought you were all a bunch of religious weirdos in a cult, and thankfully I was wrong, and it took me really learning about the program to get it and accept it.\n\nI wouldn't change anything about my life, I'm grateful for all of it today. Early recovery is hard, and the life that precedes recovery is often so sad, it's no wonder many of us were willing to consider suicide to escape. I have come to believe that we have a potential of sorts, a source of energy, a kind of growing capacity generated in the void of the emptiness that is life in addiction. It is the inverse of recovery, like the dark side of the moon, but I believe it conceals something very powerful we cannot see. It is there all along, if we can only reach that fork in the road, to access the moment of clarity and take the path that is right there for us. My journey since then, I swear every door opened, and a stone appeared before each step of the of the way on this path. For many of us we must reach the end to find a beginning, it's beautiful and almost sort of hard to believe how these things are true about life but they are. Thanks to everyone here who has been supportive over these years, you are family to me, and I love you guys. There's no people on earth who have the depth, heart, and humor of all of you, and I plan to stick around for more to come, one day at a time.",

So I work tues-thurs. except I only slept off the high last night so today I\u2019m still coming down. I don\u2019t know if I should suck it up and go to work or go to detox. I want to make sure I\u2019m not setting myself up for failure. Bc I know today I can barely stay awake and usually the day after I\u2019m the same way except my body\u2019s sore too. I just started two weeks ago at my work but I\u2019ve talked to my boss abt my addiction before but I really don\u2019t want them to hate me if I go to detox. I\u2019m really scared and stressed and just could use any advice whether it\u2019s what I should do or some tips on coming down while being on your feet all day. Thanks in advance.",

            "selftext": "It\u2019s a terrifying moment when you become aware that you\u2019re putting yourself through similar circumstances, problems, mindsets and consequences you swore you would never let yourself endure again. You start to realize how badly drugs have altered with your brain and ability to have self control. And if you\u2019re being truly honest with yourself, you realize you\u2019re even worse off than you ever were before. Real, hard, life lessons you have already been through and should of learned from the first time are back at your front door,  giving you no choice but to experience them again. Except this time around you\u2019re even more exhausted, hopeless and ashamed. To top it all off this time around you have less options, less support and less time. Drug addiction is so insidious. Substance abuse is an all too common and easy way to deal with the painful facts of life. Not only is the addicts life subjected to this physical and internal suffering, so are the addicts friends and family. No one is safe when it comes to the sadness, pain and unimaginable horrific path addiction will eventually drag you down. \n\nIf you\u2019re an addict like me, struggling but still have at least ONE friend or family member who will listen to you and be there for you, be grateful for them and reach out. If they haven\u2019t given up on you, chances are they are your genuine friend.  Don\u2019t let drugs make you think otherwise. If you have done this person wrong, reach out and apologize for your actions. Be honest about your poor behavior but also help them understand the  severity of your addiction. Most of the time the people we are or used to be closet with have no idea how bad we are struggling. Sometimes us addicts are also little too good at pretending we are ok. \n\nIf you don\u2019t use drugs but have a friend who is falling deeper into addiction, PLEASE don\u2019t give up on them. Chances are they are ashamed of what choices they have made and probably don\u2019t have many to turn to for support. If they have done you wrong, keep your distance but always offer them a listening ear. \n\nAddiction really has people out here so isolated and afraid to open up that they continue to use and dig an even deeper hole for themselves. Us addicts often surround ourselves with other addicts who don\u2019t have our best interest at heart. Sketchy people who are somehow using us or if desperate enough, complete strangers so we can continue to use unbothered. The joke is on us though because in return we create the most lonely personal hell you could ever imagine. \n\nIf you know someone out there in active addiction, who was good friend to you at one point or another, Reach out to them, ask them how they are doing. See if they need a listening ear and check up on them as much as you can. \n\nOne day you might not have that option and you will be wishing you still did. \n\nIf your addicted to drugs and don\u2019t know how you are going to get through one more day like this, reach out to SOMEONE. No matter how hard drugs make you think differently, they\u2019re people out there who want to help you.",

            "selftext": "My half-sister is an alcoholic for more than half of my life (I'm 25, she is 39). For a long time she was kind of functioning, she had a job etc. But she lost her job because of the alcohol. That was 1,5 years ago. Me and her boyfriend did an intervention for her to go to rehab but that was ineffective. She does some treatment at a rehab center but very unsuccessful mostly because she doesn't think she has a problem. The last three years I have always supported her, went to appointments with her, helped my parents because they where struggling with the situation etc. \nLast Monday she got accepted a job and the whole week she was only telling how very long ago she had problems but now everything is over and she is healthy now. I just know she was drinking while telling me that. I'm so frustrated. This Friday she was planning on going to my parents but she got drunk on the road and was missing for 5 hours, later told everyone her tire snapped. Everyone was so worried and I don't know but I was so fucking mad at her. My parents go through so much shit for her.\nI decided it was enough and it was time to choose for myself and let her figure herself out. So I told her I had enough and that I really hoped that I would one day get my sister back.\nShe was furious, that it wasn't her fault she had problems with her tire (wtf like that was the reason to break contact). And that it was my fault she went to my parents that day and that I didn't want her to be happy.\nI don't know but it kind of hurt. She doesn't know anything about me, everything was always about my sister the last years and I just want some time for myself. Is she really not understanding why I break contact? Or is this just a way for her to cope with that news?",

I was thinking why in the hell would someone pay that much for this stuff but now I know!\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \n\nAnd when I was prescribed 110mg per day I could\u2019ve made $3300 a month off off a $5 script but knowing what it does I would\u2019ve never even sold it as I would\u2019ve felt too guilty.\n\nThen one day I remember I was really tired and had a lot to do. I was prepping for a bodybuilding competition and decided I wonder what all the hype is about Adderall. I\u2019ll just try one. So I took a half of a 30mg IR and couldn\u2019t even describe how amazing it was. I was more functional, more productive, I had the energy to deal with my demanding wife and career, play with my toddler\u2019s, etc. I told myself I\u2019ll just take a 1/2 a couple days a week. Then,... I\u2019ll just take a full a couple days a week. Then, I\u2019ll just take 30mg once per day and I\u2019ll just take it during the week not on the weekends. Then holy shit I can\u2019t even function without this on the weekends I\u2019ll just take one per day every day since I\u2019m prescribed that anyway. \n\nThen a few weeks later I\u2019m thinking shit why is this not working anymore so at my appointment I informed him it works well but only for a few hours so he prescribes me (2) 30\u2019mg IR\u2019s/day. Then the next month (3) 30\u2019s/day. At that point it was game over. Finally I believe 2 months after that is when he says \u201cmaybe your getting a little bit of a tolerance\u201d so he prescribes me a 20mg IR as a \u201cbooster\u201d \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \n\nI still remember filling that script at CVS and the pharmacist was like I don\u2019t know if this is ok or not. They literally had to get on the phone with the doctor, my insurance, and like the FDA or someone of authority like that and it took 3hrs and they finally gave me the script. Dr said- \u201cwell,..he\u2019s a big guy and has a fast metabolism.\u201d \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \n\nSo, my buddy who used to buy it always snorted them and I thought he was crazy. He would snort 160mg/day. He was the manager at Bank of America and literally used 1/2 his paycheck on it. \n\nI remember one day I had a huge business/financial investment meeting and I forgot to take my Adderall. I knew it was gonna take a good 45min to kick in but my meeting was in 10 minutes so I tried snorting it. That was mistake number #2 of my life. I got that original euphoric energy again but it only lasted a fraction of the time.\n\nFrom there it was a vicious cycle for maybe 6-8 months and I finally just gave in and admitted to my psychiatrist I was snorting them and had a problem.\n\nHe says \u201cOk, well thank you for being honest with me. I\u2019m going to cut your script and give you 50mg Vyvanse instead.\u201d\n\nAt that point I was using maybe 90mg/day Adderall IR. I never actually used the whole 110mg on a daily basis. And I snorted probably 60mg out of that 90 which is awful but at the same time you lose a good 30% in the nasal cavity so I guess in a justified state I was only using around 45mg out of that 60mg. And 30mg orally so {75mg/day total}. \n\nBack then I didn\u2019t know that Vyvanse was only 40% amphetamine so that 50mg Vyvanse was basically a 20mg Adderall IR(maybe closer to 25-30mg) since dextroamphetamine is a little stronger since Adderall is mixed salts with dextro+levo. I remember that drop was absolutely brutal. I was sick and tired all day for like 3-4wks and then I got used to it A little bit but it was still pretty hard to function especially cognitively.\n\nI then had a new psychiatrist and I informed him about my history and that I could barely function so he bumped it up to 70mg Vyvanse and he had me taper off completely by 10mg/month.\n\n70-60mg wasn\u2019t too bad. 60-50mg was rough. 50-40mg was rough but a little better. 40-30mg wasn\u2019t too bad it felt about the same. 30-20mg I felt no difference. Then after 20mg for a few weeks I just completely quit and I was actually fine. Just pretty tired and a little brain fog for about a month and then I was good but always tired yet still could be productive. I was off all amphetamines a good 6-8months and then I opened up a new business and that is when I made mistake #3 in my life.\n\nI figured maybe I can use it responsibly this time around and my psychiatrist put me on 50mg Vyvanse to see how it goes. Well,... we all know how that goes. \ud83d\ude2c \n\nWhat was crazy was after that long of a break off amphetamines when I started the Vyvanse again it wasn\u2019t nearly like when I originally first tried amphetamines. It felt like a fraction of the dose so I then ended up getting Adderall IR from a connect and went downhill again with the same 80mg+/day habit. \n\nThis was about 2 years ago and I\u2019m currently struggling with taper #2 but I will beat it this time around. I know I will. And when I\u2019m off I\u2019ll never go back on again! For me there is no responsible usage. I also realize tapering isn\u2019t going to work for me this time as I don\u2019t have the self-control or discipline and I have 10x the responsibilities I did when I tapered off the first time. \n\nSo I\u2019m going to have to go cold turkey this time it\u2019s just really hard trying to organize a time frame when I can do this. I\u2019m going to have to stop working and tell my clients that I\u2019m taking a vacation or I got sick or something like that and go to a friends house for a couple weeks as I can\u2019t be detoxing around my family. \n\nI am going to be 37yrs old this summer. I have a family and I am a professional businessman yet people think amphetamine abusers are just young burn out kids which is a very false stereotype. This is one evil drug if not used correctly. They say marijuana is a gateway drug that\u2019s BS. I\u2019ve smoked a lot of weed and never had any of the problems that I\u2019ve had with amphetamines. From my amphetamine addiction I started using opiates here and there and then Xanax here and there to sleep. I\u2019m actually a little worried because I have been using 20-30mg Vicodin The past three months and I\u2019m worried I\u2019m going to have a with drawl from that as well however a few days ago I tried not taking any at all and I was fine so fingers crossed on that. Xanax I limit to 3x/wk at most as I\u2019ve seen my brother go through benzodiazepine withdrawal and pretty much every other drug out there besides alcohol doesn\u2019t hold a candle to how bad that is. \n\nI stopped going to the gym. I went from being a competitive bodybuilder training 5-6days/wk to not stepping foot in the gym with zero exercise since October 14th of last year. I started smoking cigarettes and justified they aren\u2019t bad because they are American Spirits. I used to eat healthy and now the majority of my food comes from the gas station,energy drinks,Taco Bell,etc.. I used to shower every day and maintain a pretty manicured hygiene and now sometimes I go 3-4 days without even taking a shower. I used to be very successful and would clear around $30-$40k/month and from my lack of work and losing clients that was cut in half if not a little more. I gave up most my interests and hobbies. I\u2019m ashamed to be around my family and kids as I don\u2019t want them to see a negative influence so I seclude myself and I\u2019ve lost out on a lot of time the past 2yrs of their lives that I\u2019ll never get back. \n\nThe majority of my day when I should be working I\u2019m researching neurology and ways to get through this easier but at the same I know the  inevitable answer is just going off of them completely. \n\nEvery single night when I go to sleep I think about strategies to get through the next day and every single morning when I wake up I have my Adderall next to my bed as I can\u2019t even move without taking my first dose of 30 mg which works for about an hour and then it\u2019s over. In fact I can take a 30 mg Adderall and one hour later I could literally go right back to sleep. The past year has gone by and felt like it\u2019s only been a few weeks. I\u2019ve made very reckless decisions, screwed up my sleep schedule going to bed at 3-4am and getting up at noon,etc.\n\nI am a pretty big guy I used to compete in bodybuilding and used to be around 250+lbs  at almost 6\u2019 tall at 10% bodyfat. Now surprisingly I still look somewhat the same in clothes but I\u2019m about 10-15lbs lighter of muscle and about 3-4% higher in bodyfat but I feel like death. In fact I think the arsenal of supplements and antioxidants I take along with the amount of muscle I have is what has led me to not have any more severe health consequences that I could have yet it\u2019s still a bandaid on a bullet wound:\n\n(all Vitamins/minerals)\nOptizinc, Zinc picolinate\nmagnesium(magtein),Glycinate, &amp; Malate\n(Currently looking into Sucrosomial Magnesium)\nomegas(2:1 DHA-EPA)\nVitality-C(4g), Buffered C-salts(4g)\nMitoQ, ubiquinol, idebenone\nastragaloside iv20%, Taurine, Tyrosine, ginko\n7,8 DHF, reduced glutathione,NAC, NA-R-ALA, ALCAR, TruNiagen, trans-resveratrol,  psteroline\npomella, egcg, chocamine,pomella, astaxanthin\nAshwaganda (ksm-66), Curcumin(Longvida), \nTulsi,salidroside+tyrosol, Tributyrin \nCDP choline, Melatonin, EpiCor, VSL#3\n jiaogulan, panax ginseng, eleuthero\nLions Mane, cordyceps, red reishi\nextremely expensive co2 extracted cbd Isolate,etc..\n\n\nBut regardless this has definitely taken a lot of years off my life I can tell. Just my face alone has aged a good 6-7yrs. Most doctors I\u2019ve talked to told me that most people in my situation would have turned to Meth a long time ago and I\u2019m very fortunate that I never made that mistake and never will.\n\nI went from a functioning addict to currently being on the verge of a non-functional addict. I\u2019m literally right on the brink of failure but I am going to do something about it sooner than later. So if that\u2019s not a gateway drug then I don\u2019t know what it is.\n\nI know there is a ton of people struggling with the same situation I am right now and they are blown off because people just think Adderall is a common adhd prescription. It\u2019s almost like if someone is saying they are addicted to Tylenol that\u2019s how many na\u00efve outsiders view it. \n\nIt\u2019s extremely hard when you have major responsibilities and a family with young kids and a very unsupportive wife. \ud83d\ude1e it\u2019s like I know what I need to do but at the same time with all of the responsibilities I have it makes it extremely difficult. It\u2019s very unfair I got a bad hand dealt to me from a negligent doctor especially because I never needed it to begin with as my adhd/ocd is mild. But if I just feel sorry for myself that\u2019s not going to fix anything.\n\n2 very small quotes I like but also hate that describe amphetamines in a nutshell are:\n\n\u201cWhat goes up must come down\u201d\n\nand \n\n\u201cNobody lasts on amps\u201d\n\nSorry for the novel I use voice text and this only took about 5 minutes. Honestly I\u2019m not even amped right now believe it or not. \ud83d\ude02\nBut if anyone reads this and it provides any insight it was worth it.\n\nI always used to look down on a lot of those homeless tweakers but after experiencing this I have empathy for them. If I didn\u2019t have the resources and finances I do I could easily see how someone could switch to meth or other drugs and be burnt out for good.",

            "selftext": "I\u2019m writing this more as just an outlet to vent my feelings lately... \n\nBackstory: I started medicating around 14, the usual. Weed, drinking at parties, the occasional mushroom trip. Weed has been consistent most of my life, so that hasn\u2019t gone anywhere, but opiates became really bad for me when I was about 18. Started as pills, and when those became too expensive, heroin. Heroin was my life until I was maybe 24... and all of the chaos a life like that brings. Homelessness, jobless, in debt everywhere, and burning every bridge I came in contact with. I couldn\u2019t keep a relationship with anybody if my life depended on it. So I did what I thought I needed to do, and I moved across the country. I figured that if I just removed any access I had, I could focus and get better. And, it seemed to work. A year later, I was clean and healthy. Some things aligned, and I moved back home. \n\nI\u2019m in a good place, I\u2019m high on life... and in months I was back to being my lowest. I relapsed, od\u2019d, And was resuscitated. When I woke up, all I could feel was regret. What a terrible decision, I\u2019ve ruined everything. \n\nI haven\u2019t used since, going on 6 years now. That day, that memory, has been the driving force to staying clean. Never will I do that again, and I mean it. I have the conviction. So, maybe it wasn\u2019t all bad. \n\nHere\u2019s where it gets interesting. The thought \u201cnot using is the answer\u201d is what I\u2019ve done. But that\u2019s it. I\u2019ve done nothing else. I pushed all of those feelings away and told myself to push through, it\u2019ll pass. I smoke weed all day long, saying things like \u201cI need it to sleep\u201d, but really, even I know it\u2019s a crutch. I\u2019ve effectively not dealt with anything that I went through or feel. For 6 years. \n\nIn this 6 years, I can see the progression. I can look at Facebook messages from then, and I\u2019m happy. I\u2019m full of joy, and I\u2019m witty and funny. Most of all, I felt confident. But as the messages go on, I can see how they become shorter, abrasive, and eventually just stop. This is an area that I am putting a lot of effort into exploring. Who I was then, and what made me happy. And what has happened since then that could be challenging me.\n\nMy wife called for a separation, so we can work on ourselves and figure out what it is we are doing. I\u2019m back in my hole. Nowhere to go, and nothing but my thoughts. Afraid and angry. And I find myself exploring all of these feelings that seem \u201cnew\u201d, but have been there the whole time. I\u2019ve been in denial about all of this, and in the process have hurt the people that mean the most to me. \n\nSo, as a start, I just wanted to get a little off my chest. I\u2019m not in a mental state of relapse, just kind of opening Pandora\u2019s box on myself. I know it means nothing to you guys, but it means everything to me.",

            "selftext": "Hi again everyone. Thank you for being supportive and welcoming me to this group. I'll share a little bit more about myself now. \n\n\nI'm 31, F. I live in VA with my two children, who are 6 and 2, my partner who is the love of my life, and my two sweet cats. I like to read, write, play video games, take naps, go out on dates. My kids and I like to do art together, watch movies, go to the carousel at the mall. I am also a martial artist, though I haven't been training much at all lately. I work for my dojo as an after school counselor, so I get to pick our little ninjas up from school, help them with their homework, play with them, take them to karate class. Working with kids is kind of my niche I guess, I get a lot out of being with them and I love them all to pieces. It's made me discover that I want to do that with my life. I will probably go back to college in a few years and get my degree in teaching or child psychology. Those are some good things about myself that I like to share.\n\n\nOn a bit of a darker note...I do struggle with mental illness. I've been in and out of therapy, and on and off medication, since the age of 14. I have depression, anxiety, possibly bipolar disorder, maybe some ADD thrown in there, and I round that all out with a borderline personality disorder. And, of course, substance abuse disorder. That's why I'm here. \n\n\nMy drug of choice is cannabis. My second drug of choice would be Adderall. I'm in the realm of belief that cannabis and Adderall can both be beneficial if prescribed correctly and not abused. But cannabis is illegal in my state, and it's always brought me trouble. I won't go into all of that now, but I just know that it is the one drug I would choose if I was on a deserted island. I have a prescription for Adderall, but I do abuse it by doubling...tripling...quadrupling up, and running out way too soon, which is dangerous. \n\n\nA situation happened nearly a year ago that made me face my addiction, but it took this long to really accept it and make the choice to be sober. I succeeded in being sober for two months. On my two month anniversary of sobriety I relapsed. Then I relapsed again, and recognized that I couldn't do this alone. Now I have a peer recovery person who I am scheduled to meet with every Wednesday. She is also an addict, but sober and in recovery. I have a list of AA/NA meetings that I can attend. I know that I need a sponsor. I feel like I am on the right path, but this is hard. Living is hard. Being human is hard. Sometimes it's too hard. I'm scared a lot of the time, or sad. Listening to music helps. Writing helps. Being with my children and my boyfriend helps. Working helps. I've gained a lot of weight, but I've heard that happens when you stop using. I'm okay with it for now. I also started smoking cigarettes. I know that's gross but it's better than using, I guess. \n\n\nSo those are the basics of my story. Thank you for reading.",

I do all the physical work, aka running a storefront from 9am to 7pm 7 days a week.

I know he works and earns as best he can, due to his health issues, but I also work incredibly hard, and do get worn out often.\nLong story short, today I came home and my husband was fast asleep in the bedroom, and his pill bottle of oxys was just sitting out on the kitchen table. I have asked him often to put this pills out of my way, if not outright hide them. This time I managed to put them physically under his sleeping body without waking him, which would have made him angry, but I feel like I shouldn't have to do this.\nIs it too much for me to ask for him to just put this medicine out of my sight?\nI know I'm wrong for stealing from him no matter what, but am I asking for too much?\nI was strong this time, but just seeing those pills had me scheming how to get them out from under him. \nI'm sorry this is so long, but I genuinely don't know if I'm in the wrong in this.

He was hospitalized last week for what I thought was just another bad episode regarding his GI issues (surgey complications from hernia repair). When I called the hospital to talk to him about how he was doing he broke down crying. He said that he needed help. I asked him what kind of help. He said he has been recently abusing meth. My world is shattered. We have been having problems recently, but I saw no obvious signs of meth use. He has a really rough past and I know he used to use drugs, but I thought that was all behind him. We've been focusing on building a life together, we have a daughter. She adores her dad and he is a good dad. \n\nI feel so stupid. I should have looked at the signs. Erratic behavior, staying out all night, alternating depression and manic behavior. I thought it was his PTSD. I thought it was just the stress of our marriage issues. \nI have made an appointment for him to see a counselor in a few days. I'm going to require him to pass regular UAs and attend treatment, individually and as a couple. He is so far agreeing to this. \n\nSurely it's a good sign that he is asking for help and treatment? Anyone been through this and come out the other side? I love him dearly and am willing to support him but I am willing to divorce him should he not get clean. \n\nI asked him why he decided to use and he said it's \"because he wants to die.\" I don't want him to die, I dont want him to leave. \n\nTL;DR: husband admitted to using meth. Where do I go from here?",

            "selftext": "NAW JUST VENTING\n\n\nHello internet neighbors! \n\n\n**Now, I don\u2019t think everyone who smokes weed is an addict. I know plenty of people who use it recreationally with no issues. He just abuses weed to the point to where he is facing serious consequences with complete disregard and will not change his behavior.**\n\n\nI posted about Derek a couple days ago in r/JustNoSO and deleted the post for fear him or his family would see it and know it was about him and I just wasn\u2019t ready to talk about it yet. After the initial epiphany and much thinking I\u2019m ready to open up about the topic. \n\n\n\nMy (24 f) boyfriend Derek (22) is actually a smart guy who has a big caring heart but...\n\n\n\nDerek smokes weed A LOT  to where he can\u2019t function. He can\u2019t pass classes, flakes on dates, constantly broke and stays in legal trouble. His been in trouble several times in the past 4-5 months for it. He drives like Mr. Magoo so he gets pulled over a lot they smell weed, and BOOM...charges. The past couple of days he got charged with a DUI. He has court in a week for charges he got December for weed. They said they would dismiss if he stated out of trouble. Well I wonder what\u2019s gonna happen now. Yet he refuses to cut back/stop smoking. \n\n\nHis school could expel him if they find out. (We live in a conservative part of the US, and he goes to a religious school.) He has $30k+ in students loans. He\u2019ll be expelled with nothing to show for it and in debt thousands of dollars if they found out. I would like to say the people around him don\u2019t condone this, but they smoke too. They don\u2019t see anything wrong with his behavior...Except his parents. \n\n\nI know you can\u2019t physically be addicted to weed, and his is psychological. He is risking: his relationships, not just ours but the one with his parents, his education, jail time, his license/car insurance, his future in general. He won\u2019t stop smoking it. He says, \u201cit helps me\u201d even though it\u2019s hurting him. Sounds like addiction to me. \n\n\nA few months ago he left his smoke pen at my house and pestered me until I returned it and was snarky when I told him he would have to wait a minute before I could get it to him.  It had literally only been at my house for a few hours. He couldn\u2019t go a few hours without getting high. He\u2019s flakes on dates because he \u201cjust remembered\u201d he had an assignment due the next day, this happens almost EVERY TIME we set a date. He\u2019s been \u201cswamped\u201d in school work yet barely passes any class. Yet he makes it sound like he\u2019s doing school 24/7. I realized he\u2019s been blowing me off to get high and didn\u2019t tell me because he knew I would leave. \n\n\nI feel like I\u2019m watching someone I love set themselves on fire and there\u2019s nothing a can do. Weed/getting high will always come before me, his family, his future, and even his freedom. \n\n\nI don\u2019t want to leave Derek, but I\u2019m going to have to leave. I\u2019ve always had a rule that ABSOLUTELY no weed is to be around me, my car, or my house/parents. (I do not smoke weed, I barely drink.) It\u2019s only a matter of time before something happens and I get into trouble because he breaks that rule. Getting high is his first priority. I refuse to jeopardize MY career/education because of HIS habit. His behavior is dangerous to MY future.  Also I refuse to be with someone who flakes on me for weed. I deserve a healthy and meaningful relationship. \n\n\nI feel stupid for not seeing this sooner, I should\u2019ve known when he was snarky with me a few months ago. All the times he\u2019s been blowing me off. I feel guilty for wanting to leave, I feel like I should help him even though I know I can\u2019t. I feel angry he\u2019s doing this to himself.  I KNOW it\u2019s not my fault this is his behavior, and he is 100% responsible for his actions. The couple of days have been really heart breaking. \n\n\nI try to open up to friends. They\u2019re not very comforting. \u201cLeave. Go NC. He could get you in trouble.\u201d It\u2019s almost condescending, as if I hadn\u2019t thought of that before. \u201cYou dodged a bullet, you should be happy you saw it before it\u2019s too late!\u201d They don\u2019t understand how much pain and anger I\u2019m in watching this happen. \n\n\n I\u2019m not looking for attention and I DO NOT want advice. I just wanted a safe space to talk about it. At least if this get downvoted to no end or I get snarky comments at least it\u2019s by strangers.",

I was 13 when i started \u201cexperimenting\u201d with all main party  drugs; \nweed, md, coke, Xans, Lsd. I am now 16 and everyday I want to get out of this usage of vaping / smoking  bud especially coke comedowns/ now. Have you ever been in the cycle of drug addiction and lost a hobby you really like? And please. Leave me a comment on advice of how you understood drugs weren\u2019t for you and shouldn\u2019t be. \nThank you \ud83d\ude01 \nSB",

I'm not saying you should purposely relapse if you've been clean for a while, but if you've tried everything and nothing is working, this mindset can make a huge difference.\n\nI made a video about my experiences with this and I'd love to hear your guys' thoughts on it:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icXf3i-XK2Y&amp;t=2s\n\nI realize the title is a bit controversial but I think the information might be helpful to people who have struggled with addictions of any kind.",

Mother always ill always in her room. Father abusive- physically, mentally and sexually. Everyday was another trauma until i found substances to be able to \"switch off\" \n\nEnded up in the care of the state which exposed me to another level of trauma.\n\nI turned adult and left the care system. I found myself a brilliant life partner. So caring and understanding. Our relationship is brilliant. Managed to stay on the straight and narrow, so to speak. Good career. Steady income. Healthy relationship.\n\nBut I'm an addict. A secret addict. \nTo anything. \nI draw the line at cannabis in terms of illegal drugs. Only because I know I'll have a tendancy to go to extremes. Plus I have a high profile job and it'd be too risky to seek anything harder. \nI drink daily. My partner thinks it's just a can or two. No one knows about the bottle of vodka in my underwear drawer. \nPrescription meds, codeine, valium and sleeping pills ensure i get a good night sleep. On my days off im drunk by 10am while the other half is on shift. \n\nAnd yet I wake up and go to work 6 days a week and no one has a clue that I'm watching the clock until i can pop a pill or crack open a can.\n\nI feel like im betraying my other half. It'd break their heart to know.\n\nI want to stop.

It's not like heroin where there's methadone (idk I think that's the OD cure). But I'm on probation and am having HUGE issues not wanting to do it. I just want to smoke weed and stay free (which I can and have in the past for 8 months + although there have been months where I've done it at least 6+ times which isn't good due to blood pressure and hypertension. But I'm doing alright for now but I have a weird interest\n\n\n(ACTUAL SNEEZING THING)\nSo I don't know why but ever since I've been clean I've been using toothpicks to put in my nose and make myself sneeze it's weird and it feels so good like an orgasm. I've heard it releases endorphins or something anybody else?\ud83d\ude02",

            "selftext": "When picking up meth in recent days, I began to rationalize why there was nothing wrong with it and how I was justified in doing it. Even though it caused paranoia, insomnia, etc, I still thought it was worth doing, at least for a while anyway. But not long after I began using, I found that once you develop a tolerance for meth, it eventually just increases the negative side effects while the desired effect is diminished. Another reason why I stopped was because of the dirty tricks seasoned meth heads pull to get over on you, and these people can often be the middle man who get the drug for you. I got my final warning when someone who I thought was trustworthy set me up to be robed by another tweaker. Never trust someone living in active addiction. I thought this guy was the exception because he seemed to function normally while using meth regularly. Drug induced paranoid schizophrenia is no good so fuck this drug and fuck all drugs, because as an addict I will crave it again at some point and it will not end well if I start using again.",

Writing about my recovery has really made an improvement since I can't always get to meetings. One thing that has really helped is I have a few pages where I write down addiction \"quotes\", some from the NA principles, and most from what people have said here that really stick out. Some examples:\n\n-Never alone, never again\n-one is too many, a thousand is never enough \n-remember there is a reason why you decided to get clean, get help, and get away from the chaos \n\nEtc.\n\nThey may be cheesy, but holy cow do they help to read when I'm having a bad day and not feeling as strong as the day before. So I really wanted to thank everyone for sharing in this sub, I see so many people saying small things that make a big impact on my recovery.

Full disclosure I am a gay man who lives in the south so my access to said uppers is unfettered and all consuming. I can't go a day without seeing at least 10 people high. Now this goes to say I have managed my addiction from what was a daily event to once every other week if I have enough off time to recoup. I can no longer be able to have sex unless chemicals are involved. As someone who was a slutty teenager and young adult , as well as someone who could fall in love easily and many times this has completely changed that area of my life. I barely even j.o anymore. I've completely associated dope with sex. I've literally abused my dick from the amount of rough high sex I've had that even if I somehow stop long enough I still probably won't feel or get pleasure from sex anyway. As a late twenty year old this really makes me question my existence. What's a life without love. What's a life with meaningless hook ups with people that don't care about you at all and whom all seem to be the same. I wish I could kill myself. But I can't. I've tried and complacency has set in from those episodes. When it comes to a career I'm at the top of my game which is completely new to me. But emotionally I feel like I'm dying a little more everyday. I've become very good at not letting that show. I haven't had a genuine smile on my face in a long time. I've mastered the art of hiding how you really feel far in my mind. Alchola been my mistress as of late too. Those nights I can't smoke I drink. Literally drowning my feelings. Ironically being an depressant this makes my emotions even more unstable. I just ended a day long bender of smoking and fucking and I feel so empty. Here we go again. Tomorrow morning I'll feel like death when I have to work memorial weekend. Another day I have to put on another facade. What I'll do after who knows. Probably won't make this spin cycle stop I'm sure. Fuck I hate who I am right now. Rant over.",

Lately I been looking all over the web to find a better paying job (hopefully turn into a career) but a lot of the good ones require a drug testing. My problem is that i'm afraid to quit smoking weed.\n\nI been smoking for almost a decade. The reason i started was because i use to have insomnia back in high school, I would be up night after night and my mind would be racing all over the place. As soon as i discovered weed i immediately fell in love with it because it gave me that good night sleep i have been looking for.\n\nA few years later have passed and i had a problem with binge drinking alcohol. I loved how it made me feel, just a little too much. I was a different person every time i was drinking and i would sometimes get violent. Weed has helped me with getting off the hard liquor for good and cutting down my beer consumption to 3 or 4 a day.\n\nLast thing weed has helped me with was to quit smoking cigarettes. I smoked for 5 years and it took me 3 times to try quitting. The 3rd time i quit cold turkey, weed has helped me a lot with the withdrawals and killed the cravings. I haven't had a cigarette in 1 year and 9 months and still going strong!\n\nIf i quit smoking weed im afraid im gonna go back to binge drinking and smoking cigarettes to help me relax. I really wish i didn't have to quit but i really want my life to get going!\n\nI need advice on ways to relax the same way weed helps you to relax because i can't find anything that comes close.",

            "selftext": "So I have a seizure disorder (tonic clinic seizures) that I am on lamictal for. I also have mild anxiety. I am prescribed .5mg of Klonopin to be taken as needed for my seizures/anxiety. Sometimes I will go months without taking the Klonopin, sometimes it\u2019s more frequent like several days in a row. \n\nLong story short, I have never felt addicted, I never felt different after taking it, didn\u2019t see what all the hype was about, it just made me feel normal. My seizure auras cause me to be very spacey, shakey, confuses, etc. the Klonopin takes that all away. \n\nAnyways, this past week I took one a day for about 4 days. Longest I\u2019ve ever taken them in a row. Won\u2019t get into details but last one I took was yesterday, but before that it had been about 2 days since the 4 pill a day period. I felt really weird yesterday so I took one but now I\u2019m starting to wonder if it was a withdrawal from the Klonopin. \n\nSorry for rambling and maybe not making a lot of sense I\u2019m not a good writer, but I\u2019m wondering how to taper off without having a seizure. I\u2019ve been seizure free for over two years, and I\u2019m not worried about feeling \u201cbad\u201d from withdrawal (if that\u2019s what it is) just want to do it safely. Ok too embarrassed to contact my doctor because he always warned me about them being addicting, and I still need the prescription so I don\u2019t want him taking that away. Please help!",

            "selftext": "Just a quick post for anyone out there who is going the the 24/7 dosing nightmare. For the last 9 months I have been dosing 24/7. I decided to take a tolerance break and did a quick week taper and last night was the first night in almost a year I was able to sleep for 10hrs straight with out having to wake up and take a dose to go back to sleep. What I ended up doing is just spacing out the time between my doses. I didn\u2019t even cut back on the size of dose. Went from 1hr to 3hrs to 5hrs etc... I did use baclofen for the first couple days in order to help stretch out the intervals and then the last 2 days I used phenibut. You will get withdrawal symptoms and it isn\u2019t comfortable but you just have to fight through it and go as long as possible without dosing. Just wanted to tell some of you there is hope. If anyone has any questions or needs any kind of advice don\u2019t be afraid to ask. \nGood luck!!!",

He\u2019s done cocaine every single day for the past month or so and has been doing it in general for months along with ridiculous amounts of mdma and ketamine (as in 7 pills over the course of 24 hours ridiculous) and he smokes weed often too. He\u2019s smoked weed since the start of highschool but in the past 8 months his drug use has spiralled out of control. He rarely leaves his flat, has anxiety, paranoia and most likely depression too. I\u2019ve never met someone with so much self hatred and with so little purpose in life and a point to what he is doing. He hasn\u2019t been to work in 3 months and has kept it a secret from me and my mum until recently and I think he may lose his flat soon. I know far more about his drug use than our mum does as he trusts me along with maybe one other person in his life but I don\u2019t know how to help him. If I don\u2019t do something soon he will die whether he overdoses or kills himself. I\u2019ve told my mum he needs to go to rehab but money is an issue and she is not taking it seriously enough in my opinion. I feel like I\u2019m the only person who can help him at this point but I\u2019m so lost with what to do and I\u2019m only 16. How can I organise for him to go to rehab? Are there facilities with the NHS? How long does it take to get accepted? Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks.",

            "selftext": "I'm 21 and he's 19. My boyfriend does not smoke cigarettes, thank god, but he has used a vape since I've been dating him (over a year). He does not act like a douchebag or vape because it's cool. He started in highschool, probably because some of his friends were doing it. He has a small, inconspicuous vape and uses juice that creates minimal vapor. He also doesn't use it in close proximity to people or inside stores. But I know he's using juice with the maximum amount of nicotine (unsure of the correct term for this). At this point, he uses it because he's addicted. \n\nUsually his vaping doesn't bother me, but the problem is when he misplaces or breaks his vape. He is normally a very gentle and calm person, but when he doesn't have nicotine for more than a couple hours he becomes very irritable and anxious. Sometimes he even has anxiety attacks if he knows he won't be able to have his vape for an extended period of time, like if it breaks on Saturday and the shops are all closed on Sunday.\n\nLast night he left his vape at a friend's house and threw a fit this morning because he wanted to go get it but couldn't find his keys. He started yelling and throwing some things. Not breaking anything but throwing clothes or kicking stuff. This is very unlike him and only happens when he's experiencing withdrawal. I want to stress that he's never violent towards me or mean to me and I never feel scared that he'll hurt me, but I hate seeing his addiction control him like this. I've said many times that I don't want him to vape anymore, but he doesn't listen. I get it, but I hate how he acts when he's in withdrawal. He isn't mean, but he's very irritable and negative. He's in denial that vaping is bad for you, but I know it can't be healthy. Much better than cigarettes, but it is not good for you and I'm sure in the next couple years we will start seeing more evidence of negative side effects from frequent, long term vaping. \n\nI guess my question is, is there any way I can help him ease off of vaping so much and eventually quit? I love him and I hate that his addiction controls him.",

            "selftext": "Any advice would be appreciated. I was recently staying at home before a cross-state move for a new job. My family member has battled alcoholism and drug related issues for maybe 5 years now and I enabled her to relapse after being clean and sober for almost an entire year. I currently work in healthcare and admittedly was in possession of some controlled substances which she got into while I was staying at our home. I just got a call from my parents who state she says I gave it to her. The worst part of all of this is that they think I am completely to blame. I know she is an addict and I should have never had these substances anywhere near her. I am already out of town and am feeling just absolutely defeated by this situation. She is currently on a 3 day hold due to suicidal ideations and will be sent to a detox center afterward. \n\nI am hoping for some insight on this issue. I don't know what to expect but thank you for reading.",

I spent hundreds of dollars on Xanax and Bupropion. I used nicotine to get off of that which went fairly smoothly until my parents found my juul and took it promising they\u2019d send me to rehab if they caught me doing it again. Naturally going cold turkey is fucking impossible when you\u2019re 16 years old, so I bought another and using a network of supportive friends started to ween off by using lower nicotine concentrates. Then my parents found that and took it so I started using CBD to help since it was legal and helps thousands of people quit smoking, and today my parents ransacked my room, took a ton of my belongings, and found my CBD pen. They kicked me out of the house today and decided to let me come back for the night.\n\nI have no clue what I\u2019m going to fucking do, I can already feel myself getting nauseous and getting cravings, I\u2019m out of a job and of school so I have no way of buying anything to help this without stealing, I failed a drug test and my parents are considering turning me into the police, I have terrible grades and counselors are trying to see if I\u2019m gonna fail out of high school or not.

After she gave substances up this year I asked her if she had anything left at her apartment and she confided she kept some pills in case she gets a kidney stone. Her reasoning is she cannot always afford to go to the hospital and she needs pain relief if it happens.

I\u2019m physically and psychologically dependent on high dose salt based nicotine (50mg vape juice nonstop for around 1.5 years) as it is not something I can willfully cut out from my life. I have no control over my nicotine addiction. I feel like I can stop smoking weed though, but I\u2019m currently back on day 1 without. I took my vyvanse this morning after skipping it yesterday, and am currently chain vaping in the school bathroom out of my burnt ass novo pod. \n\nI want to quit smoking weed because of its harmful effects on my cognitive performance. \nSome things I\u2019m trying to get better at doing include:\n\nFreestyle rapping (can\u2019t think of the words, or I can but they get jumbled up and I freeze up)\nI am not witty or quirky anymore\nI can\u2019t skateboard. (I\u2019m not coordinated enough to be steezy, all I can do is watch and imagine :(\nAnd stimulants have affected my ability to get an erection. (Not terribly, I still make it happen but sometimes it\u2019s a bit worrying)\n\nI just want to be the sober me I know was better than this me. \n\nHas anyone experienced these drawbacks? Loss of physical coordination? \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the worst version of myself. (Kinda like how in Rick and Morty there are infinite timelines, and you\u2019re the worst version of yourself as opposed to the one that made better choices?) \n\nI could\u2019ve had so much more than what I have now. \n\nFFS I pulled my tooth out on LSD when I was 14. \nI got punched in the face last year and forever will I have the dimple that ruined the symmetry of my face. \n\nI feel like shit.

Reading through your struggles and how you all offer advice to one another by sharing your own experiences is something I appreciate. It gives me comfort that I'm not alone in my own struggles with my own humanity. While I've never personally struggled with addiction, I'm about to marry into a family that has had their lives tested with it by a few family members with lots of different vices from sex, alcohol and prescription pain pills. For various reasons, I think my fiance is addicted to weed.  This is just one of the many resources I've read, but he checks a lot of these boxes: [https://thecanyonmalibu.com/blog/10-signs-of-marijuana-addiction/](https://thecanyonmalibu.com/blog/10-signs-of-marijuana-addiction/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe is one of the kindest, most accepting, gentlemen I've ever met. He's mathematically and scientifically gifted and so adorably socially awkward. He's the most attentive, loving dog dad and will be a great father one day if we have kids. Right now, though, I know he's addicted to smoking weed so it gets difficult for me to see our life together 10 years into the future in terms of his reliability and character--especially if kids are around. Yes, I know he will always be there--but there's a difference in a dad who is physically there and always in the picture versus a dad who is INVOLVED.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur last confrontation happened yesterday when he picked me up in his car after he'd been smoking. He was driving under the influence in a busy city with our dog in the car. I find that incredibly irresponsible while he says it makes him focus more. That can't happen with a kid in a car. Rashly, I told him if he ever drove a car under the influence again I would pack my bags. I don't know if that was the most effective strategy because I don't want to leave him--but I don't want to enable his addiction. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat are ways that family members or loved ones have directly impacted you effectively? What advice would you have for me in order to help him see this through? Is a rehab situation necessary?",

This was the biggest regret of my life please dont make the same mistake as I did.\n\nNow i am 17 years old. I have tried every drug i got into my hands and also was a coke addict for a few months and had a mental breakdown after the  withdrawal. I broke up with school multiple times. I have achieved literally nothing in my life yet. I suffer from depression and recently im also feeling more insecure everyday. I am playing video games 24/7 smoking 2 packs of cigarettes a day, and a bunch of weed bowls. I am sick of my life. I cant change tho, and things wont change alone. Its 9.30 am now and it makes me sick thinking after my nap i will wake up at around 5 pm and have the same day again. Playing games 24/7 while beeing stoned and having 0 social interractions. I had everything, i was really popular in society and girls.. but things have changed really fast and i didn't even realize it until it was to late. Now i can't change anymore. I dont have power left, i can't, it's to late.\n\nI would have killed myself a lot of times already if i wouldnt love my mom. She already lost 3 sisters/brothers so I don't wanna do it to her.\n\nI don't know why i am writing this, I am so desperate my biggest wish is to never wake up from sleeping.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks if you read all this sorry for wasting ur time lol. Dont try to encourage me to change my life, to start sports or to have social interractions again etc. , because i won't.\n\nBecause i can't",

It\u2019s already half way gone :( this is probably the 5th or 6th time he has done blow but man he loves it. He would do anything to get more. Earlier this week he also got prescribed Vyvanse... don\u2019t mix it unless you like being scared like him. He\u2019s been smoking weed basically every day for 3 years and every weekend his goal is to black out. See I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s becoming an addict or if he\u2019s still suicidal and is just trying to put whatever he can into his body, except things harder than blow (hopefully it stays that way.)",

            "selftext": "I am struggling to find self-worth. I am 26/m and have been addicted to marijuana for about 7 years. When I say addicted, I mean I'm smoking as soon as my eyes open and I smoke a fully thumb-packed cone (bowl, bong) about every half an hour, until 2am. I go through about 7grams every 24-48 hours. Vomiting and sweating plus incessant insomnia without it. I have been also drinking every day for the past year and a half. I drink to feel comfort. I had a really gross, regular MDMA habit in 2017, which actually impacted on my ability to control certain muscles in my face for a time. I have been recently diagnosed with anxiety and depression stemming from repeated violent trauma in my early teens, and definitely exacerbated by my lifestyle.\n\nI have come to reddit because the toxicity I've drenched myself in, for what feels like my entire life, has taken it's toll on my connection to source. What I mean by source is, that feeling of home somewhere inside of yourself that comes from knowing those around you, support you. I have completely isolated myself not just through non-action, but have also verbally lashed out at my partner two weeks ago and pretty much dissolved her whole idea of who I am. She left me, this being our second year.\n\nI haven't felt self worth for years. The problem with that is, you don't take care of yourself. In turn, you can never nurture your relationships properly. Inevitably, those people WILL remove themselves from the situation. It's called self-preservation I guess. My family live two states over and all of the people I know in my city stem from work, so while there is a sort of feigned deepness, my mind struggles to trust that it's authentic connection there. I work within creative industries and have pretty much never had a solid income.  Hell, before I met my partner and moved to the city I'm in now, I was homeless for 18 months. That lifestyle put extra pressure on my partner who basically sees me as ruining her life, which I do not blame her for. She's been the only person to truly ride with me like no other, and I've pushed it to it's limit. Too many promises I didn't keep. I just refused to help myself.\n\nIt's taken me so long to see that my addiction has a big part to play in the other toxic areas of my life. That being said, I still feel absolutely no desire to put the drugs or the drink down. I have made steps towards getting regular income, I just fear that it'll all be for nothing if I can't address the core issues here. I suppose that I just needed to get some of this off of my chest. I'm hoping that I can be the best version of myself. But why do I stay so enamoured with the idea of being a user? It's part of my identity. How did I let it get this bad?",

I have struggled with my depression for the last couple years and have resorted to self medicating via whatever means. Recently after taking a large amount of LSD my depression has been the worst it\u2019s ever been. I can hardly function and spend most of my time just laying down. Music doesn\u2019t feel good. Food tastes disgusting. I\u2019ve lost 30 pounds this year and I feel like my health could be at risk soon. I\u2019m not suicidal but I spend a lot of time wishing I were dead. I wanna go the hospital or something but I\u2019m scared. I don\u2019t know my resources and my mother would be devastated if she found out about my drug use. I\u2019ve been very good at hiding my feelings and drug use from most people but I don\u2019t feel like I can keep this up anymore. What should I do?",

            "selftext": "Veteran of 5 inpatient and 2 outpatient rehabs here.  \n\n  \nI'm not saying going somewhere to get distance from your last high isn't a good idea.   It's helpful and even necessary in many cases.  I'm not saying that there aren't people (usually recovering addicts) at treatment centers that genuinely care about your well-being, there are.  What I'm saying is that, in my experience, the \"treatment\" you get in rehab is more often than not is laughable, misleading and even counter-productive in some cases. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have yet to go to a rehab that doesn't rely on the 12-step model.  This seems like an utter cop-out to me, charging people thousands of dollars a day to educate them about a free program.  So much of the time spent is dedicated to watching \"recovery-related\" movies that are usually highly dramatized and unrealistic to the normal person or about celebrities which is totally unrelatable to 99% of patients.  Furthermore, comparing yourself to a celebrity is one of the worst modes of thoughts an addict can have as it exacerbates feelings of narcissism and isolationism, a dynamic many addicts struggle with.  \n\n \n\nSure, there is the minimal amount of scientific education sown in, but in my experience it is generalized and boiled down to laments terms.  I've gone several times in the hopes of getting some personal therapy only to see an unlicensed counselor 2-3 times over the course of 28 days.  They're over-packed and ill-equipped to deal with the patients they take in and as a result everybody is treated like a prisoner, furthering feelings of isolation and hopelessness.  In most cases my aftercare has been haphazard at best and put off until the last minute.  Several times I have had to take placement into my own hands or passed it off to a family member because the rehab wouldn't allow me access to the resources I needed to do research and due diligence.   I have ended up in worse situations than I was going into the rehab.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSure, you meet other addicts in rehab whose shared experience provides some solidarity.  You also get tips on how better to manage and hide your addiction, where to get drugs, and inundation with war stories that trigger cravings.  Group therapies are facilitated by unlicensed counselors who basically serve as glorified babysitters.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's a racket.  Rehabs have the resources to hire professionally licensed therapists but recovering addicts are cheaper.  They have the means to educate you about alternative treatment routes other than 12-steps (that are more proven) but it is cheaper to bring in AA meetings and tell a person that if they fail at AA it's their own fault and they did everything they could.  It decreases liability and accountability for the institution while perpetuating the misconception that AA/NA is the best route to recovery.  They're packed to the brim, I've shared a room with 5+ other people.  You would think adequate sleep is a priority in early recovery.  They provide the bare minimum of education and therapy, if any, and operate with the bare minimum staff whose primary purpose is to keep the place from devolving into riot.  They charge over $1000/day for a cot, 3 (normally kinda awful) meals, minimal supervision and basic toiletries.  Sure, the first few days you're in detox but this is typically overseen by a single nurse practitioner and entry-level nursing staff, and that's only the first few days.  Good luck to you if you're trying to get face time with an actual psychiatrist.  I have literally been relegated to face-time (on a cell-phone) with a therapist at rehab which lasted 5 minutes (if that) of zero eye-contact and resulted in the over-prescription of unnecessary anti-depressants that would keep me docile while in the facility.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are going to rehab, do your research.  Do LOTS of research.  Outpatient rehabs are often the same or even worse in terms of the price scale.  I go to one now (fortunately through insurance) that bills $1400/3-hour session that is overseen by a single, unlicensed practitioner.  Do the math, that's over 15k/session who's overhead is $20/hour (if that) for the practitioner plus facility costs.  If you want to get rich quick, start a rehab.  The industry lacks basically any oversight/regulation beyond the Geneva Convention.    \n\n\nJohn Oliver did a good expose:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWQiXv0sn9Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWQiXv0sn9Y) .

Every year Mentor does a fundraising campaign called Do More 24 to raise money for the organization.\n\nMentor was founded in 1994 by Her Majesty Queen Silvia of Sweden and the World Health Organization. It is the largest non-profit network of its kind for evidence-based programs that prevent drug abuse among youth. Mentor has implemented projects in over 80 countries impacting more than 6 million young people. \n\nOpioid addiction is currently the biggest public health crisis in the United States. More than 130 people per day die from opioid overdoses.\n\nPlease click on the link below to join me in helping support Mentor Foundation USA. Your $5, $10, $25, or $100 contribution will make a big difference. Together, we can help empower more young people to live healthy and productive lives, free of drugs. \n\nThe campaign lasts until noon on 5/23.\n\nPlease direct donations to this link: [https://www.domore24.org/richmerskimentor](https://www.domore24.org/richmerskimentor)\n\nThank you for your support!",

The dark desires when nobody is looking. Im a closet user in its entirety.  Cant help but jus want to get high and i cant seem to find the real reason why.  Ive seeked help before.  Been there done that.  Rehab, NA , all the works.  The point im making is the thought of recovery just seems so embarrassing and unpleasant.  I mean whats the point of getting help when its all me who makes the decision.  Im not gonna have others put drugs to my mouth.  Its my decision.  I want to stop doing drugs but it just seems out of reach.  Seriously",

I don't know much about ingestion methods or terms, and keep in mind, they're only 16, and I know for an absolute fact that their family already has issues with finances and has had a history of issues with drug addiction in the past  \n\n\nUnfortunately, this is the only detail I have about Sam at the current time, I don't know if they're taking anything else atm (Though they've implied cocaine as well...), I may update the post as I find out more, but all I know is that I don't want Sam to ruin their life at such an young age and I would really appreciate anybody can give me advice on how to get them to stop before it's too late...Yes, I know they're an ex  \n\n\nBut I still care about them",

Thankfully I was able to take a medical leave of absence for 6 to 8 weeks to handle all this. I have since wiped all my old phone contacts and gotten a new phone number.\n\nI have zero desire at all to use meth again right now but the withdrawal symptoms i am feeling are nearly unbearable. I last used Friday night and it is now Wednesday afternoon. I have done nearly nothing but sleep during that time. I have no energy. I have no patience. I am snapping at everyone and everything. I can't even focus on watching TV. The only thing I am getting some pleasure from is taking long showers while listening to some of my favorite podcasts.\n\nWill this horrible feeling of anxiety and dread ever end? Anyone have any advice?",

            "selftext": "Hi guys, that post is some kind of a confession. I want to give up addictions and change my life that became really unpleasant. I am 30+ programmer from some kind of third-world country. I waste most of the time on videogames, watching youtube videos, scrolling down 9gag and other 'funny' stuff. I have many things to do, but my brain just goes insane forcing me to seek for instant pleasures instead of working. That kind of behavior led to many troubles in my life: missing deadlines, losing jobs, breaking relationships etc. However, it goes on and on year after year. Sometimes I could handle better than usual, but that period lasts for a couple of months and then everything comes back to the same track. I am tired of that kind of life, that vicious circle I am about to break.  \n\n\nI believe that all that addictive behavior and compulsions are the consequences of the life I am not proud of. Something that I want to distract from and not having much pleasure to live. I want to change it step by step setting some achievable goals and building self-confidence and personal maturity. So, today is day 0, 4.30pm GMT is the turning point (at least i hope so). I'll keep posting some kind of progress reports here, maybe that kind of community support will help too.   \n\n\nThanks for reading.",

            "selftext": "This sounds a little strange, but I'm becoming genuinely worried about it. There's a video game I've been playing for the last four years and it's began really impacting my life. \n\nI find it really satisfying and calming, but it's gotten to the point that I'll play for 10+ hours without eating, drinking, or using the bathroom. So far my grades haven't suffered and I've managed to tear myself away for the really important things, but I'm now meant to be writing my dissertation and I can't motivate myself.\n\nWhenever I'm away from home, I think about going home and playing, my attention span is shot, if I play for too long I begin struggling to string sentences together - it's starting to impact my other hobbies and interests. \n\nI keep thinking it's okay because I can still go out and do things, but if I'm spending time with someone I'll literally be thinking, 'ok, since I'm here with a friend the gaming isn't so bad, because if it really was bad I wouldn't have come out at all.'\n\nWhat should I do? I deleted the game and am now thinking i'm just overreacting, but is playing for even a few hours a day really damaging if I get this hung up on it? Should I just completely remove it from my life, or is there a way of finding a balance?\n\nI obviously really enjoy playing it but struggle to find a way to balance it with the rest of my life. I've always known I have an addictive personality so I've avoided alcohol, drugs, cigarettes and more, but now this has crept in and I'm feeling very uneasy.",

I go to meetings with her and we talk to addiction counselors etc so we have some support and I know I'm not doing more harm than good... Unfortunately she relapsed recently and things have been bad. I go to her apartment yesterday and find doctor's pregnancy tests all over the place, yanno the little stick they dip into your urine sample? Like dozens of them all over the place. She has 3 small children already who live with their dad now, she insists she hasn't been sexually active as she's dealing with trauma from childhood abuse. Why would she need all these pregnancy tests? And not even home pregnancy test kits. Do the tests used by doctors pick up other substances? Is she trying to test her own urine to see if she'll pass a drug test? Any insight would be appreciated! \n\nTL;DR - is there any reason a person who is addicted to drugs would take pregnancy tests, other than to test for pregnancy?",

He also has ptsd and a bipolar diagnosis, but we\u2019re both thinking it might actually be borderline. \n\nI\u2019ve been enabling him for a lot of our relationship. Not on purpose, but he\u2019s been there for me through so much. I\u2019m very chronically ill, and he\u2019s been my rock. However, I recently discovered that not only is he still taking prescriptions he said he wouldn\u2019t take, but a lot of his life story is exaggerations and un-truths. Not straight up lies, but pushing the limits. I broke up with him, but we still live together and love each other. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I want him to find help. He\u2019s trying to get help, but mostly because he wants us to be together. I want us to be together too, but I know that he has lied to me and feels that he can sneak stuff by me. I\u2019m his entire support system here - we don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s better for him to live with me or to move out but have no one. Is there anything I can do to support him? Is there any way to be in a relationship with years of history enabling someone? This is all so beyond me.

            "selftext": "Boycott Shame and Blame\n\nConsider this story from a thirty-four-year-old recovering heroin addict: \"When I started working the Steps, I realized that guilt and shame had been dragging me down for years. I've finally learned the difference between guilt and shame. Guilt is feeling bad about something you've done, but shame is feeling bad about who you are. You can do something about guilt: admit the wrongs, apologize for them, and take corrective action. Shame is harder to fix. It goes hand in hand with being secretive and defensive. You have to learn to accept yourself and love yourself just as you are. You are doing your best right now, and you'll continue to do your best in the future.\"\n\nAction for the Day\n\nIs there any shame that you are holding on to? Do you continue to blame yourself for things that happened in the past? Describe the one thing that shames you the most. It might be the one thing in your life that you would change, if you could. Write it down. Forgive yourself. It helps if you realize that you were doing the best you could do at the time. You are doing your best--even when you fail.\n\nThought for the Day\n\n\"Most folks are about as happy as they make up their minds to be.\"\n\nAbraham Lincoln\n\nQuoted from the app Field Guide to Life from Hazelden Publishing.",

Limiting to the following conditions:\n\n* No nicotine whatsoever\n\n* No soda whatsoever (I was drinking 1-2 a day, awful for your kidneys)\n\n* Limit avg 1 alcoholic drinks / day\n\nSo far in 8 days I've had 7 beers (3 days with 2 beers, 1 day with 1, 3 days with no alcohol), 1 soda split with my girlfriend on day 1 with my girlfriend and no nicotine at all. If I'm being totally honest there was a little wine in between, but not a considerable amount worth marking.\n\nIt's getting to the point to where it's difficult, where the mood swings are setting it in, where the urges are telling you if you just have a little it'll be ok and you can manage with just a little now and then. Just take a hit once every couple weeks or a third beer on a workday won't set you that far back.\n\n\nI don't want to use nicotine or drink soda at all (soda obviously being the easier one here) and alcohol Id like to keep to a mild buzz or less level as I do legitimately enjoy beer from the first sip\n\n\nI don't know, I'm just struggling a little. I've got good support but feel on edge. my parents both smoke and my dads an alcoholic so even though I'm on my own now it's still engrained in me.\n\n\nI've had 2 beers tonight and I'm fighting the third one and the vape sitting next to me (choosing not to throw it away like I did my last as I learn refrain best when it's available)\n\n\nIIIIIIIIII guess this is just getting it off my chest? I don't know just felt good to type.\n\n\nTo make this message have *some* content, I've printed a calendar and marked 40 days as that's how long on average it takes to incorporate a new habit. Once I conquer these it becomes finishing my weight loss journey (60lbs down, 30lbs to go to goal weight(",

Funny thing is he's the one that told me what it smelled like. \n\nHe is a former user before he moved to the state. When I told him that I found it he wouldn't say anything. I asked if he was okay and he said 'sure'. After I asked if he was going to seek treatment he laughed and said 'sure' again. Our relationship has been strained the last few months as well, hes lost a considerable amount of weight, we cuddle every night but there hasn't been any physical or emotional intamacy in months.  I'm only 23 and hes 29. I feel too young to be dealing with stress like this. I barely have my own life together, I didn't sign up to take care of an adult, I thought his constant lack of money was from the student loans he has to pay. I've seen what drug addiction has done to my family and have gone through a lot to get away from them. \n\n I dont know how to talk about this without feeling like I'm attacking him. I know that it's a disease, we live together and I want help him work towards recovery. He has no family out here on the west coast. They're all in the midwest. What do we do?",

            "selftext": "Last week a friend of mine was having a thousand ideas a minute, asking me about all these businesses saying he needed investors and that he had borrowed 30k.\n\nA week later he apologized very nicely for like \u201ccausing me trouble and bothering me, because I\u2019m always looking out for him\u201d and called himself stupid\n\nI felt this was leading to a favor. I just said \u201cthanks\u201d\n\n4 days later I was asked for a book I had received from said friend as a gift back.\n\u201cI sold it online and forgot I have it to you and I don\u2019t want amazon to get mad\u201d\nI would also like to note that it wasn\u2019t apologetic or anything it was like \u201csend this for me\u201d\n\nI called him out on apologizing to get a favor \nEnded up having a long discussing about trust and respect... no idea why? That seemed like junky talk. Finally said they would pay me to do it (should have said so from the start)\n\nThis is a lot of trouble for $30.....\nCould also be manic depression but it seemed way weird\nHe got mad and blocked me because I didn\u2019t want to send it in the end... I do feel a little bad for saying I would trust him if he paid first \n\nBut honestly, I don\u2019t want to give back a gift for someone else\u2019s monetary purposes.\n\nVery weird.  Other explanation is manic depression but to my knowledge he\u2019s only normal depressed.\n\nThoughts?",

            "selftext": "Just a bit of background on my mother -she 60 years old ,living in the UK with a life long history of mental illness. She is a recovering alcoholic who has been in and out of rehab my whole life. She had also spent years in psychiatric hospitals during her 20s, and around 6 years ago she suffered a nervous breakdown where she was admitted into psychiatric care for several months. \n\nAround 3 weeks ago out of the blue my mum experienced a major psychotic episode. It started with her having really intense dreams that would make her delirious during the night. This however quickly escalated into such much worse. I can\u2019t really describe to you how she was acting because it got to a point where she was completely incomprehensible she couldn\u2019t even string a sentence together. One night she woke my sister up at around 3 in the morning in a panic asking her to get dressed as she had to take us to a dance rehearsal (neither of us are dancers !?) We were obviously completely spoked by this so we rang our non-emergency healthcare line for advice. In the end the advisers didn\u2019t feel as though she was in any immediate danger and we booked her a GP appointment that following morning where they basically told her it is probably just a fever from a bug that is going around. That night around 3 in the morning I caught her reversing out the drive way, thankfully I got to her in time because she was still in a psychotic episode and thought she was meeting a friend she hadn\u2019t spoken to in over 40 years ! \n\nThis bring us to this weekend- \nOn Thursday she fell in to what we thought was just a depressive episode (which is quite typical for her) and she called my sister to cancel her plans so she could sit with her because she was feeling low. I rang her in the afternoon to pick my up from the station and this is the point where I realised she was acting strange again as she was completely unintelligible on the phone. Her mental state just got progressively worse over the weekend -she spent all day in bed with the light off not eating or sleeping or bathing. Her psychosis got much more serve to the point where she thought my recently deceased dad was at the window, and our house (in the English suburbs )was about to get bombed ! We were obviously terrified about her mental state but she assured us it was just withdrawal from her antidepressants that she had run out of. On Monday morning we booked her an GP appointment for that afternoon so she could get back on her antidepressants. On the Monday afternoon I did a food shop for her -I left the house with her still in a delirious state and in the short time it took me to come home she was completely fine and told me she isn\u2019t going to the GP because the tablets she has been waiting for had arrived. This is when we became suspicious of what these \u201ctablets\u201d were as we hadn\u2019t sent the prescription for antidepressants yet, and even if we did our medication has NEVER come by post. We asked her if we could see the packaging for these pills and she flat out refused. When she left the room my sister searched in her draw to see what she had just took and we realised it was etizolam.\n\nWe googled it and found out it is a tranquilizer that is not licensed in the UK (or basically any where in Europe) so the only place she has access to them is buying them illegally from China/India online. We confronted her that we now know what she has been doing and what caused these withdrawals and booked a GP appointment for her to discuss it with a doctor this afternoon. We wanted to come along with her to make sure she was honest with the doctor but she promised to us that she would be. She came home from the appointment and had obviously not brought it up (.....shocker). Over the past few days we have called multiple people for advice : 111 line ,The GP ,mental health lines and Frank. Everyone we have spoken to has basically said the same thing ; that they can\u2019t do anything without her consent and she will have to be the one who reaches out for help. The most helpful call was with the FRANK helpline who told us to basically treat her with tough love - if we mollycoddle her she will have no intensive to get stop. We explained her how this is going to go down, we are no longer going to be so soft on her because her behaviour is not a mental health issue -it\u2019s a drugs issue -but as we expected she lashed out at us and  denied that she even takes these pills (and is now in a strop)\n\nThere is so much more to this situation but I feel as though this post is getting too long.\n\nI feel completely out of my depth with this as like I said previously, my dad recently passed and in the past he was the one to deal with her addictions and mental health problems. \n\nWe can\u2019t seemed to breakthrough to her as she feels patronised that this is coming from her daughters so I do not trust her to get professional help on her own. My anxiety over this is heightened by seeing how Intense her withdrawals are, and to make matters worse she also has a codeine dependancy which according to google, when combined with etizolam can be deadly.",

So once I did my first line, I noticed I was reacting so differently than others at the party, they were all amped up, bouncing off the walls, so on, but for me it was the most calm and focus I had ever even dreamt possible. So I kept doing it, and if anyone heres had similar experiences in life...not much more needs to be explained. (And I mean any addiction isn't something happy healthy people just do for fun so...I don't mean you get it because of speed or PTSD shit...we all have our reasons. My favorite sarcastic responce to it being ENTIRELY a choice...its complicated anyways is \"yeah sure! Everyone wakes up once in a while and decides they want to become a crack addict because its a fun activity for the whole family!!! Its 100% clearly outlined for us how fun it is!\"). I ended up struggling since either 2013 or 2014...around 2015 was my first attempt to kick it, but it didn't last so long...or so well. But around this week marks my 6 solid months! I still smoke weed, drink as seldomly as possible as that was my first issue substance, and the drinking I got a better handle on, the weed helps me for now so quitting isn't going to work for me just yet. My problem with trying to understand the difference and the effects of making it this far is that I seem to be having a lot of moments of \"is this a reaction to Fibro treatment? (Diagnosed April 9th this year) or is it my traumas finally ending for long enough and my mind realizing the impacts of that? Because that alone...I could go on forever about...I've been through enough now that its clicking inside mentally that just because a trauma wasn't \"as traumatic as the bigger ones\" does not make it not traumatic...so still finding wonderful new little treasures daily there...or is it coming so far into sobriety?\" And I grasp that its a mix but I'm having problems figuring out which is linked where and how to respond to each reaction. I also wonder if some of the moments where I feel like I'm high again? But I've also lost 10-15 pounds relitivly quickly since April and diet changes...so does that change anything? Any tips on wtf to do from here would be appreciated or things others notice when they've reached mile stones...what to expect moving forward?",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone I have been on a roller coaster of coming off of Kratom. I\u2019ve had a little success here and there, I get three days under my belt and then binge. The longest I\u2019ve gone is two weeks. I have a 2 1/2 year addiction and I was up to an ounce a day. My desire to quit k drove me to start taking my ADD medication again, Ritalin 20 mg three times a day. It really helped me stop obsessing over k and helped me to direct my attention to mental health and getting off K all together. However, I am now taking more than prescribed of the R and when that gives me heart palpitations I take a bunch of K. My addictive nature runs so deep. I can\u2019t even believe it myself. I would really love to find an AA sponsor that I can communicate with via Skype or FaceTime on a regular basis but I don\u2019t know how to go about finding the right person. Tomorrow I need to absolutely be done with R as it is only destroying my sobriety and drives me right back to K. Has anyone else experienced the same situation? Any advice on the sponsor question? I have three kids and they will all be out of school in two weeks and I am fearing the state of mind that I am going to be in if I don\u2019t get this under control. Also taking a family trip with a nine hour car ride on Thursday and I don\u2019t want to torment my family because my mental health is in the toilet.",

I went on a pretty strong (none of this microdosing stuff lol) psilocybin mushroom trip with a good friend with the intention of finally quitting opiates and letting go once and for all. It worked. I am clean from opiates for 2 years and counting. They (the mushrooms) absolutely helped me step outside of the box, and made me realize how much I was needlessly hurting myself for all those years. The affect seemed to stick around after the trip as well. The feeling is not as strong now of course, but I am still clean. I really feel like it \"reset\" my brain somehow.\n\nAnybody else have experiences along these lines? With psilocybin or another psychedelic and their addiction(s)?",

            "selftext": "So I went in for a walk on interview at a produce plant. While I\u2019m interviewing for a packaging job.   A recruiter for the housekeeping part of the plant overheard me going over my YEARS of cleaning experience.\n\nI had a house cleaning business and filed taxes on my earnings for 4 years. I hated cleaning but i couldn\u2019t get a regular job because of the felony I was convicted of 8 years ago at 18 yrs old. I stopped cleaning last year because the guy I was dating said I didn\u2019t have to. (Big mistake it was a power move to control me we are not together anymore)\n\nSo even thought I didn\u2019t really want to clean anymore. I need a job now because I can\u2019t run a cleaning business without a car and the recruiter seemed like I would be a good fit for this job. I EXPLAINED IN DETAIL MY CHARGES AND WHY. I was assured in the HR office that nonviolent charges don\u2019t hold me back from being hired while I was still on my packing interview.\n\nSo he pulls me away from my packing interview, I talk to the head of housekeeping, he loves me, tells me Wendy, the lead housekeeper will call me later and if she wants me to come in we will go from there...\n\nSo later that day (Friday) she calls me and tells me to come in today at 1\n\nNow I get a call 30 mins ago and she tells me that she has more people to interview so don\u2019t worry about coming in today...\n\n\nWhy the fuck would you tell me to come in and THEN cancel me. I am over qualified for HER job so my experience isn\u2019t the problem, HR assured me my charges wouldn\u2019t be a problem, so fucking WHYYYY.\n\n&amp;&amp; it\u2019s like BITCH I didn\u2019t even want this job I wanted the packing job. And now that interview got cut short only because everybody heard my qualifications and pulled me over to housekeeping so not only did I not finish my packing interview but the opinion of this one woman fucked me all the way up.",

Mostly Vicodin and I was up to the point of taking 10 of the 10\u2019s all at once...sometimes more than once a day (idk how I have a liver?) but anyway I came out about this to my fianc\u00e9 and his family as well as my own and everyone has been supportive and helpful. \n\nI just need advice on making it farther. I tend to relapse once every 2 weeks or so. My record is like 28 days. Which, for me, is GREAT considering. My fianc\u00e9 drug tests me every so often randomly and he\u2019s been getting really upset if it\u2019s dirty. It\u2019s like after 2 weeks I take 5-10 pills and then don\u2019t again for 2+ more. I just need the cravings gone.\n\n I made it through undergrad and GRAD SCHOOL with this damn addiction. I literally got my masters in public health...where I learned all about the opioid epidemic... and the whole time there I was in class super high on them myself...Anyway, what is the best way to deal with cravings!? The withdrawals aren\u2019t so horrible anymore and only last a day or so after taking them and going off another random 2 weeks. I am 27 years old and just looking for advice or help or ideas in any way, shape, or form. I talk to a counselor weekly and that\u2019s a little helpful but I need more. :)",

When i cut myself off, I had the body tremors, vomiting, shakes, chills, anxiety, all the good stuff. So I know what moderate/severe withdrawal symptoms feel like.\n\nI just want to know what coming off 10mg Vicodin once per day will feel like. Thank you",

            "selftext": " \n\nIts been less than 4 hours since my dad told us that my brother is back on drugs... and my heart just breaks in pieces.\n\nGrowing up, my brother and I weren't close. We are 17 years apart, we lived in different cities (still do), so I rarely saw him, but though very distant our relationship is good and we both care about each other's wellbeing.\n\nHe first started using when he was a teenager. There are no addicts in our family, so this came as a huge shock to everybody. He's from my dad's first marriage and so for years my mom blamed herself for his addiction since he started using soon after his parents' divorce. He had many ups and down... stealing, being homeless, going to jail, going to rehab, getting HIV, back to jail... and eventually getting 100% clean by the age of 29-30.\n\nIt was a long way for him but he finally managed to get clean, have an apartment, a job, a fiance, and 3 cats. As I said, we never got the chance to be close, but I was always so proud of him for getting clean and getting his life in order. Looking at the statistics he was a true winner coming out of so many years of addiction in one piece...\n\nThat was until last year. He broke up with his fiance, for all we know it was mutual. He doesn't have any friends. His old friends were all addicts and he never bothered getting new ones. We didn't think he took the break up seriously, he travelled for a while and I guess we all thought it was fine... until today. My dad went to his city for work and they decided to meet up. He would call dad these days more than usual because he said he felt lonely but he sounded alright. He and dad always argue about everything so the conversations weren't even that fun for neither. The second my dad saw him, dad started sobbing... he lost a lot of weight, spent most of his money on drugs, went back to stealing, and is in serious danger of losing his apartment.\n\nIn 2010, I lost my older brother to cancer... I can't even bare the thought of losing another brother... thinking of the life he had before getting it together... it's a nightmare. I want to help him so so much, but have no idea how. I want to call him tomorrow but I don't know what to say, and I'm too emotional right now even thinking about it... If anybody has any advice, I could really use it.",

            "selftext": "So for many \"videogame addiction\" is something overprotective and uneducated parents keep telling their children, but to me it has become a reality. Been playing games on anything since 7, now 15. At this point i realise that although this hobby was enjoyable a couple years ago, now i just play because i \"have to\". I play because im used to it, and now i rarely enjoy the games i play, i just rage and swear a lot. This also has an impact on my school results. Although im nowhere near hardcore in terms of a student, i tend to neglect many important assignments which can affect if i pass the year. The assignments are there in my head but i just keep on playing. And today, i am going cold turkey for the 3d time. And this time i want it to count.\n\n\n What are some of the strategies you guys use to avoid relapsing and thinking \"maybe my addiction wasnt so bad afterall\"\n\n(most of the times i failed because i convinced myself that videogames didnt play an effect on my life when they did)\n\nThanks for reading",

            "selftext": "I originally posted this on relationships but I got a message saying that my post was removed and that it is better to post here. So here is the copy and paste of what I posted: \n\nWe have been together for 6 years. He has a drinking problem. It\u2019s been a thing. I have asked him to stop several times because he can\u2019t control how much he drinks, and on top of that, he turns into a huge asshole when he\u2019s drunk. \n\nThe last time he got really drunk I gave him an ultimatum, me or alcohol. He said it wasn\u2019t fair and so we agreed he could drink but not to the point of getting drunk. I had a feeling this wasn\u2019t going to work.\n\nLast night we were supposed to have a nice date night. We are house sitting for his sister and she lives by a pier, so we walked to a bar on the pier.\nBefore we left he had been drinking tequila. I asked him to promise me he wouldn\u2019t drink too much when we got to the bar, and he promised me.\n\nWhen we got to the bar, which was a place that only offers beer, he asked them for a pitcher of their strongest beer. I told him I don\u2019t want to drink their strongest beer, and that I didn\u2019t want a pitcher. I had been drinking too and I knew I\u2019d be good with one glass of beer. He did it anyways. \n\nThere was live music and we danced, it was so much fun. However at one point he went outside and talked to a group of guys, who were also drunk. I peeked my head out and asked if he could come inside to watch my drink and keep our spot so I could go to the bathroom. I guess one of the guys drunkenly made a joke saying something along the lines of \u201cyou better keep an eye on your girl before I make her mine\u201d (?) My boyfriend took this extremely bad and started making friends around the bar for \u201cbackup\u201d. The people that he talked to would look at me with an \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d face. My boyfriend decided to stare down the guys and wanted to fight them, he continued to drink and I grabbed our stuff and said we\u2019re going home. \n\nOn the walk back he started telling me that I\u2019m an idiot. He stopped people and asked them to tell him if we seemed drunk, because he didn\u2019t think so. He sat down on a table and I said I\u2019m going home. \n\nI walked a while and expected him to be following me but he wasn\u2019t. I got scared for two reasons, one I am alone on a basically deserted pier around midnight, and two I wanted to make sure he was okay. I went back to look and couldn\u2019t find him and I started panicking. I finally found him laying on a bench. I asked him if he could get up so we could go home and he fell down on to some rocks. \n\nThen he was unresponsive. All he was doing was hiccuping and drooling/throwing up on himself. I tried to talk to him and was getting no response. Again, we have been together for 6 years and I have seen him get very drunk many times, but never like this. I started to get worried, and after he wasn\u2019t replying to me for a few minutes I called 911. \n\nAn ambulance came and they picked him up, and took him to the hospital. He was a huge asshole to all the first responders. He fought with the nurses and tried to leave so they put him in restraints and he started yelling. I have never seen his eyes look like that before, it was like he was awake but sleeping at the same time. \n\nHe\u2019s been struggling with money and so I know these hospital bills are gonna hit him hard. He will be really mad at me for that. Last night he told me he wanted me out of the room because I \u201cmade a mistake\u201d. However the doctor, nurses, and first responders continued to tell me it was good that I brought him in. \n\nMy question is, where do we go from here? Is it now fair for me to give him the ultimatum of alcohol or me? This is a reoccurring event, this time it was just taken farther that the other times because he became unresponsive. I love him and he is not an asshole when he is sober. What should I do? \n\nEdit: we are still at the hospital, he has been getting fluids and they won\u2019t release him with me until he is sober. We have been here for over 6 hours now. I\u2019ve had less than an hour of sleep, so please excuse any errors in my post. \n\nTL;DR\nBoyfriend got really drunk which is a reoccurring event, however this time it was so bad I had to call an ambulance. Tried to give him an ultimatum regarding alcohol before, is it fair to give it to him after this? Wondering what to do.",

            "selftext": "I was reading an article and got to the following paragraph. I would appreciate hearing your thoughts on this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Bruce Alexander, a retired psychology professor from Simon Fraser University, said misconceptions around addiction\u00a0have deep roots. In the 1970s everybody believed that if you just took a little bit of heroin two\u00a0or three\u00a0times, you would become addicted, said Alexander.\u00a0It isn't true.\n\nAccording to Alexander, much of our understanding of addiction stems from a well-known experiment, The Rat Park experiment,\u00a0in which rats were placed in a Skinner box \u2014\u00a0like a bread box, but smaller \u2014\u00a0with nothing but a lever. When they hit the lever, they'd be injected\u00a0with heroin, right\u00a0into their jugular vein. In the experiment, the rats quickly became addicted.\n\nAlexander and his team decided to recreate\u00a0the experiment\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but in their version, they put the\u00a0rats in\u00a0a more natural environment, something like a garage floor. They found the rats living in the \"rat park\"\u00a0used far fewer drugs than those contained in small boxes.\n\nIf you put anybody in solitary\u00a0confinement\u00a0\u2014\u00a0person or rat\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and give them nothing whatsoever\u00a0to do, except take a drug which makes them feel a little bit better, that's probably the only thing they'll do, said Alexander.\n\n\"The problem is they haven't got anything to turn to. And they've got to have something to turn to.\"\u00a0- Bruce Alexander\n\nAlexander now studies Indigenous communities, and says his research has found that\u00a0loss of culture and high rates of addiction go hand in hand.\u00a0\n\n\"When culture is destroyed, addiction, and a host of other problems that go along with it become prevalent in a way that's unsustainable, and it becomes scary,\" he said. The problem is not\u00a0the drug, they could stop using the drug, But the problem is they haven't got anything to turn to. And they've got to have something to turn to.\"\u00a0",

            "selftext": "So I am just going to write that I do not know if I belong on this sub but I've been having issues quitting playing computer games and the fact that I have a problem quitting is letting me know something is wrong. Now is it addiction? Maybe not but I figured I should try to ask around in this sub. \n\nQuick background: I used to play excessive computer games at one point in my life because I was depressed. Got over the depression. Got really busy with work and life and then started noticing that ever few weeks I have an urge to binge by playing computer games for an entire day or two or three completely sabotaging my work. I then get very depressed because I don't know what is going on. So I decide to quit playing computer games to end the cycle.\n\nI noticed that when I quit playing computer games I go through a week or two of wonderful peace because I am spending my day meeting my daily goals and life feels great. Then a few weeks go by and then I get an uncontrollable urge to play computer games and spend an entire day (I should be doing work) and then it goes on for a few days. \n\nDuring this time when the urge hits I get bombarded with doubts of whether I need to even quit playing computer games despite knowing the pattern above is not healthy. Those doubts occur at vulnerable moments when the cravings are very strong and I need to remember why I am quitting.\n\nI don't mind playing computer games but I need to control when I play it so that it doesn't sabotage my work (I am currently behind on so many deadlines and have taken time off work to mentally fix myself). The fact that I don't have this control is making me concerned that I either have a serious mental health condition or this is an addiction. Thats why  I am asking if this all reads as a addiction withdrawal issue to this sub as I know the mental health one is a diagnosis only a mental health professional can answer.",

It's just difficult. Being in this environment also really underscores how different I feel from \"normal\" people, like there's a sort of rift of understanding between what their lives are like versus where I've come from (living in a shitty shuttle bus or the middle of a field, shooting heroin and meth, shoplifting every day if not having my GF prostitute herself for our dope). It's times like this that really highlights the idea of feeling \"alone in a crowd.\" I hope I can change this part of myself someday.",

She would go to lengths such as taking my siblings and I shopping for school supplies and clothes to show my stepdad a receipt then take everything back to get money for drugs. She would also do this with our groceries and take back what she could. \n\nThe only one in the house who had some sort of idea  what was going on with my mom was me. Even then i had no idea she was addicted to drugs until I got older and pieced everything together. She would take me on drugs deals with her to get her pain pills before she started taking my dads prescriptions. At one point she took my younger brother and sister with her and sold to an undercover cop off of craigslist. \n\nDue to this she was on the news and almost all of my friends parents and family members that knew who she was wouldn't let me go to my friends houses or talk to them because of my mom.

However, I knew that I saw changes in behavior, a lack of morals and a lost sense of reality. Of course as a young child I didn't think this advanced, it was more of \"Mommy is really tired\" or \"Dad is really mean to mommy\". \n\nMy mom started using drugs recreationally as a teenager. She started with weed and psychedelics in high school and soon after she graduated she tried meth for the first time. From what I was told she was up for 10 days straight. From there she didn't do meth regularly at all but continued to smoke weed (side note: im not against weed medically or recreationally) she began getting into more hard drugs again when she was working in the medical field. \n\nShe was exposed to pain pills such a vicodin and would buy and sell them through her coworkers who would do the same. She couldn't hold a job due to her addiction, though with her high paying job she could afford the addiction, but could not keep up with the job itself physically. She then continued to work in the medical field as an easy access to prescription drugs. \n\nWhen she couldnt hold a job any longer she would count on my other dad (who raised me because my biological father was in prison) who needed to have multiple surgeries because he worked hard as a construction worker. He is not addict but he was an alcoholic before I met him. My mom would pick up his prescriptions for him and either sell them to get the drugs she wanted or take them.",

Both of my parents have been addicted to many substances. As well as both of their parents and some cousins aunts and uncles etc. For instance, my mom has done more drugs than she was addicted too but her drugs of choice for certain points in her life were black tar heroin, crank, opioids. My biological dad suffered with similar substances such as black tar heroin, meth and crank. \n\nAs the child of these two individuals I felt like I was one of the causes of their addiction or feeling the need to use drugs. As you can imagine I wasn't a planned pregnancy. However I put a lot of blame on myself for their problems. Reminder that this is not to shame my parents for their drug use, this is to relate to anyone else who has bad the same experience \n\nNot only being aware of the drugs use in my family but seeing first hand the drugs themselves, the paraphernalia and the deals it was easy to get a grasp of the routine at such a young age. I wasn't aware of the addiction part but I thought of it as their \"medicine\" in a way.",

I had another friend just two years ago succumb to an H addiction. Every now and then I\u2019ll be offered it, but I decline. There\u2019s been days I\u2019ve been tempted though. Which scares me. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if I should just tell her I love you but I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t have you around, or if I should try and tough it out and help her in whatever way I can. It\u2019s my personality to stay and help, but it\u2019s depressing me really bad. Im just so torn because of my feelings. \n\nAm I dumb for putting up with this?",

I\u2019ve been using it on and off for about 2-3 years now and even though I feel like I\u2019ve made progress in limiting how much I take I still feel almost like a hollow shell of my former self, I very rarely go out and hang with friends anymore, my family has been trying their best to be supportive because they are aware of my situation but I feel like we\u2019ve become a little more distant and they don\u2019t trust me as much and for good reason. The weird thing is I\u2019m not even really productive on it anymore and I couldn\u2019t tell you why I continue to take it but I\u2019m wondering if anyone has been in my position and can give advice or if anyone is going through this currently I want you to know you\u2019re not alone.",

The first night I tried it I went out drinking and crashed at a mates and he wanted to do a few lines, I was already drunk so I didn\u2019t think it through and said sure I\u2019ll try some it can\u2019t hurt. The next day I went out and bought a gram of coke and did some after work and I really enjoyed it (which is the worst part for me) and I\u2019ve used it every few days since. I\u2019m scared to admit to people that I\u2019m an addict and I try to deny and justify my actions but when it comes down to it that\u2019s all I am. I can tell my body can no longer handle the shit I\u2019m putting in to it but I don\u2019t have the sense to stop. I\u2019ve gone through severe bouts of depression and use that as my justification  of my bad habits to help \u201cnumb\u201d the pain but once the drugs wear off it comes flooding back. I try to show that I\u2019m ok but I know that deep down I\u2019m not and masking it won\u2019t solve any problems, I\u2019m just too stupid to seek the support I need. I\u2019m so afraid of being labelled  for my mental health and drug abuse that I\u2019ve not spoken to anyone about it. None of my friends and family know how bad I am at the moment and I don\u2019t want to burden anyone with my problems so I tend bottle things up and will have a little breakdown and pretend it\u2019s all ok after. I can either see myself dying from an over dose or just outright killing myself and it seems like the only escape I\u2019ll get. \n\nHoping someone can point me in the right direction to get help without outing myself to friends and family.\nAny advice is much appreciated \nCurrently living in London if that helps.",

My self harm was a way to take the pain that I believe I deserved. Lots of things caused it but the main person was my dad. He is a horrible person, when I came out is when it hit me so hard. I would go to bed believing that I was a faggot that deserved to die. I wanted to end my life but it seems like death is a harder goal when you try to die... I lied when my sister saw the large scar on my stomach; the cut was so deep, i remember that one i cut so deep and i stitch it together myself i know it wasn't okay but it kept me from going to the hospital. I done this for years, i even had a list!\nCry: 1\nGet yelled at: 2\nCalled fat:4\nCat called:6\nGet mentally harmed by family: 10\nGirlfriend hit me: 12\nMy list was a bit long but it worked eventually i was getting high on top of it. I smoked so much that i barely remember anything but i have a shit ton of scars from myself and my ex. Recently i almost relapsed again but i know that would mean all the hard work i did would be a waste. I got myself clean twice by myself from self harm. I still do weed but its to keep myself from causing harm to others due to me being violent when im angry and im doing well i got to where i need a bowl 2-3 times a week! I just wanted to share with someone sorry. Also thanks for the choke dad! I love the fact that you almost had me relapsed again!",

But ever since, all I\u2019ve been doing is buying anime figures such as nendoroids and such. They\u2019re just really cute to me and having them makes me really happy. \nBut I spend about $300-$500 a month on just this hobby that even my parents are mad at me. I go as far as to run to the mailbox as fast as I can and throw my packages of figures in a bush. Sounds silly, I know, but I just find good deals online and from friends that I can\u2019t resist even though I know the figures are not going anywhere (though someone always ends up sniping the item I want but that is not the case). \nI\u2019m trying my best not to look online for figure sales and such but it\u2019s so hard and I know that I feel a small dopamine rush when I spend my hard earned money on something I love to collect :( Thanks for reading, any advice/commentary is appreciated just wanted to vent somewhere.",

He has struggled for years, and at this point all of us family and friends are at loss of what to do, how to support him, and how to help. \n\nI came up with this idea to make a short book, composed of a collection of anonymous open-letter entries from family, friends, and strangers alike, to share with him - I know he feels alone and I guess this is my way of showing him he\u2019s not and to help support him. \n\nIf you are a addict (recovering or not), I am requesting you to write him an open letter. It can be as long as you\u2019d like, but I picture it being like you sharing your experience, your struggles, what encouraged you to change, and your road to recovery (if applicable). If you knew then, what you know now, what would you tell him? What advice would you give him to keep fighting?\n\nYou can comment here or PM me... names/usernames will not be mentioned in this creative process unless you specifically want to be mentioned. \n\nI appreciate it greatly and hope the best for you all! \n\nBe well.",

            "selftext": "I fucked up my social life; All because I couldn't stop playing Fortnite. It all started at the beginning of last summer. So  I got out of 6th grade (12 at the time) and had INFINITE time because it was the summer. I started maybe playing 4 hrs a day at most. Eventually season 5 of Fortnite got released and that's when it got out of hand. I stopped going out with my friends and only play with them online. I didn't talk to people outside of fortnite and if i saw someone from my school while I was out of the house I would try to walk the other way and I would have a panic attack. And instead of talking these problems head on I just hid behind the screen. I would get up at around 10 am and start playing around 11am. I would then eat dinner within 10 minutes around 5, then get back on till around 11pm-12am. All while it is so nice out and sunny. I would play all day with no irl interactions except for my family. I did do some camps from like 8 am to 3pm. i would then get a on Fortnite around 4pm and play till 12-1 am. This went on all summer. I would have some times where i would go to things with my Fortnite friends and we would go do something like go a party place or to a football game at the local college/highschool. They would often bring some of there friends from school (many of those kids i am good friends with now) to these events. I would often have a full on panic attack when these people showed up. Especcially when they brought girls. I for my life could not talk to a girl, i would freak the fuck out and end up leaving right away crying and my heart beating like fast af. After a few of these experinces i stopped going out. I also during this time did not exersise. ( i work out every morning now and have some biceps now lmao) Sitting around and not exersising makes you super skinny. Especially becuase my mom would say i would get fat if i didnt exersise. this scared the absolute shit out of me and i starved my self basicly only eating like 1k calories a day. I eventillly got to be 5\"4 and 90 pounds. (im now 5'6 and 124 pounds :)) i started getting bullied suoer hard about being skinny i was called a noodle all the time. i dont want to get to into the bullying as it is  hard to talk about. im good now. Basilccly going back to school was withdrawl and bully and panic attacks every day. Im now free of my addiction. I play a max of 4hrs a day streaming fortnite and i have now 250 followers on twitch and i have 1200 on instagram through fortnite content. i LOVE to flirt and talk to girls. i can meet people with out freaking out. I love my self now. my old self was narcasisitic anxous and ugly. Im atractive now and love to flirt and love my content and following. I dont have any irl close friends witch is hard as im an introvert who loves companion ship. I find it easy to talk to people but i am left now with no little irl friends. I have many online friends and love talking to girsl but it going to take some more time to fix what ive broken. Ive made so much progress and am much happyer. Im 13 now and nearing the end of 7th grade. Im still making friendships and flirting. Thanks for reading this all. I sorry about spelling and i just needed to get this out. &lt;3 stranger!",

Sober living all day throughout my teen years, never any issues or temptations. At 19 I was prescribed Valium when needed for some serious anxiety before sleeping, I\u2019d stay awake for days. Took it and off- it was meh. Did without it for months out of laziness. \n\nWound up changing doctors. Foreign hole-in-wall office but he took my insurance and was able to see me quick. He started me on 1mg of Xanax, then to 2MG when my tolerance grew quick as hell. Now I\u2019m popping a bar when I wake up (because I feel SICK physically and am having seizures which I never had before if I go 2 days without it), one mid-day, of course- at night. Of course I have now had to resort to buying off the street, since my 30 day script is gone in 10 days. \n\nI don\u2019t want to be dead before my 21st birthday. If I come clean to mom and dad- they\u2019ll 100% put me in detox, a nice one too. Would this warrant detox or should I just see a different doctor locally? I don\u2019t feel any \u201chigh\u201d at this point, I never really did. I just want to sleep and not feel sick anymore. I\u2019m scared I\u2019m going to die from seizures.",

I had 3 months of basically total abstinence (minus some painkillers for a recent tooth extraction).  \n\n  \nI decided to go have a beer last night with a friend.  Turned into 3, naturally, but over 3 hours and I didn't get wasted or anything.    \n\n\nI guess I've been so engrossed in recovery that I wanted respite.  I've always been frustrated by the whole idea of powerlessness, the disease concepts, and other 12-step dogma/cliches.  I don't agree with a lot of it and am taking a more therapy-based approach this time.    \n\n\nAnyhow, I'm not terribly happy about it (I was a little hungover this morning) but I did enjoy myself thoroughly.  Having a \"sobriety date\" seems like an unnecessary pressure to put on yourself and suggests that one slip-up  negates the entire duration of your sobriety.  I prefer to look at the aggregate:  I haven't drank  99 out of the last 100 days.  I call that progress. \n\n  \nI am definitely not planning on making a habit out of this.  The risks outweigh the rewards by far and I don't want to risk falling back into cravings for harder stuff.  I am just going to (not) pick up and keep moving forward with my new lease on life as though it didn't happen.  I think I can do that.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just wanted to put that out there.  This sub has provided some really good discourse for me over the past few months.  Thanks!",

Looking back it's likely been a problem for at least 2 years. A little over a week ago I decided that I wanted to be done with this and decided to stop looking at porn. First couple of days were real rough with anxiety and stress from controlling impulses. I relapsed for about 3 days and am now on my first day back on track. I had no idea that addictions were seriously this rough let alone for porn. I guess I'm just looking for some general help here. I'm in new waters.",

            "selftext": "I\u2019ve had this discussion with myself every single time I feel myself coming down. I know it\u2019s the lack of dopamine that makes me feel regretful. I know that I\u2019m not usually this depressed but I feel so lost. \n\nHi Reddit, my name is unimportant and my story is even less significant. Meth addicts are a dime a dozen and while we all suffer from the same mental disease we all respond to the drug differently. Most people like to fuck U.T.I. Some use it as a conversational lubricant, most tweakers usually use it as an excuse to pick up a project they will never finish (amirite?) Personally I don\u2019t really know why I use it. I suppose its because I\u2019m bored, I\u2019m not doing what I feel I\u2019m destined for and the extra time sober is a constant reminder I\u2019m not on the right track. \nI love my mom and I would never trade her for anything in the world. She has a Masters in Education and is very accomplished in her profession. The only thing wrong with her is she is an enabler. She knows what I do and she knows when I\u2019m high but does not do anything about it. I\u2019m not saying she is responsible for getting me off it and getting clean but I literally have an eternal safety net because I have no repercussions for my actions. It makes me angry that I can do all this under her house and not feel remorseful about it. It makes me uncomfortable to think that I may spiral out of control once she dies but yet I still do it. \n\nI\u2019ve always been an eccentric kind of person, you know, the type of friend who\u2019s been labeled the funny guy. I treasure that part of me because it helped me with bullying in middle school. I could turn any insult into a comedic routine and keep people entertained as long as there was a crowd to perform for. I LOVE it, I live for it. I\u2019m really quite the performer and I\u2019ll always make you smile but because of this I\u2019ve lost the ability to be level-headed. I can\u2019t figure how to be \u201c28\u201d. I\u2019m very immature emotionally and I don\u2019t know what it means to adult. The only bills I have is my phone and internet bill. I live with my mom and she pays all the rest. Addiction has inhibited me  to grow in all sorts of ways mentally and spiritually. I don\u2019t want to be these gross ugly tweakers that I see walking down Boulder Highway but I can\u2019t stop myself from seeking Meth out. \n\nI\u2019m stuck, what can I do Reddit? I\u2019m too lazy to get clean, but I struggle because I see the best years of my life fading away...please anything you might have to say might have an impact. I need to hear what you think about this.\n\nGive it to me good.",

            "selftext": "Hello\n\nI'm not sure if this is the right place to seek help but I honestly don't know where to go or who to talk to at this point. \n\nMy bestfriend has been in a rough spot for almost a year. He's never been the most open person about his problems. He's always the most carefree in my small group of friends. But at one point, things for him started falling apart. He's been suffering from depression and he's not doing well in Uni. I always tried to be there for him, but he never ever really shares his feelings so all I could do is make sure that he knows I'm there for him.\n\nHe told us that he started hanging out with this group of people and admitted that he took something, I don't really know what. At first, I was angry and upset, but he told me it was just a one time thing. I tried to understand as best as I could, things just got a bit much for him and he needed a coping mechanism. \n\nI really believed that he wasn't ever going to do it again but he kept going back, and it all spiralled out of control. Next thing we know, he's not himself anymore, he's barely around and he lost so much weight in such a short amount of time. He'll go missing for days and come back without really telling us where he went or what happened. At this point we don't know what to do. \n\nBut at one point, he was actually trying to get better. I could see it, he was hanging around us more although not saying much. He was eating again, and I just felt hopeful that he was trying. \n\nI'm currently in a different country from him, but I just found out that he was missing classes again and he was going missing for days again (from his housemate who is also a close friend of ours). Being away and not knowing how he's doing scares me. He doesn't respond to texts, but he'll open my snapchats and will send a few back. So that makes me feel a bit better\n\nI don't know how to help him. He never says anything to us anymore and I'm lost. Some days he'll act like his normal self but then he's gone again. I don't want to lose my bestfriend. I'm scared and I don't know what to do to help. \n\nMaybe I haven't been the best of friends. Maybe I haven't tried hard enough to get through him? I feel like a very shitty friend at the moment. I was so busy with my own life that I didn't realise how bad my bestfriend is going through his own. I've been so selfish and I really feel like I should've been there for him more.",

I have a chronic disease and I smoke weed to numb the pain regardless of the burdens I apply to myself and my loved ones in the process. I have tried traditional methods of treatment but there is no cure, weed has the least side effects and the most benefits. However, my disease is expensive to treat and painful to go untreated, while at the same time I must stick to a strict diet of foods or I risk aggravating my intestines and I fuck myself for hours or days depending on what I ate, potentially leading to a flare-up. The food I have to eat is more expensive because it is mostly stuff that isn't processed and is organic. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am addicted to masking what is happening to me. I realize the future is going to get more painful and there is nothing I can do about it. Pain is part of my life, I have to deal with that. I need to stop spending money on weed and cigarettes and just face the pain, face the music. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat suggestions do you people have for me to help me? I gotta sack up and deal with the pain head-on. I don't have friends to push me through it, I have to do it alone.

It would contradict the whole total-abstinence thing, but if other prescribed medications are fair game why not psychedelics administered in a clinical environment?  \n\n  \nWhat do you think?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nps- I do realize MDMA is habit-forming and maybe not in the same category as other psychedelics.",

            "selftext": "This is going to be a long. But I need to get it off my chest. After being sober for 6 months, and going to rehab, and attending meetings and making such huge progress in my life I willingly relapsed. But here\u2019s why.\n\nMy addiction is to my adhd medicine, I was taking 250mg of adderall a day, and ended up tanking a lot of things because of it. However not being on the medicine I struggle to accomplish normal tasks like I used to, I\u2019m more wound up, and after 6 months of recovering things never snapped back to normal. I didn\u2019t feel excited about anything, I didn\u2019t feel purpose and drive and desires. I was just a blah person. And I knew, that if I just took the right about of adderall that all of those problems I was having would go away. I tried telling my doctor what I was struggling with but he kept pushing off treating my adhd and wasn\u2019t listening to the desperation I had. So I took matters into my own hands. The only problem is I can\u2019t moderate them. I can\u2019t control myself, this is my 3rd day awake, and I am on a binger. So I effed up. And I don\u2019t know what to tell my family because it will shatter them. I can\u2019t tell any of my friends because no one will understand, and they will all be very disappointed in me. No one can ever know. But the problem I have now is that I don\u2019t want to stop again. I don\u2019t want to be sober because the reality is that life kinda just sucks. So what\u2019s it matter? Idk. Idk if here is any help for me. I feel like a lost cause. And I kinda just give up. \n\nOkay end rant.",

As you practice and become more aware, you will become quicker at spotting and addressing these emotions before they threaten your spirituality and your recovery.\n\nIf we focus on looking outward, we think other people, places, and things make us angry, which allows us to hold on to resentment and avoid making changes.\n\nLook inward often to ask if you:\n \u2022 are often impatient\n \u2022 think others always do things wrong\n \u2022 feel that to get something done right, you have to do it yourself\n \u2022 feel the need to prove yourself\n \u2022 complain a lot\n \u2022 are often frustrated\n \u2022 cannot \"go with the flow\"\n \u2022 are often disrespectful of those with less power\n \u2022 have frequent outbursts of temper\n \u2022 feel your needs are minimized or ignored\n\nAction for the Day\n\nReview this list and identify what pertains to you. Write positive affirmations for each feeling or action as a way to begin acting \"as if,\" such as \"I am a patient, loving person.\"\n\nThought for the Day\n\n\"The addict is only human. Addicts are . . . often faced with conditions that arouse anger, but we need not be ignorant of the potential destructiveness of unexamined anger or the inroads its impulses can make upon recovery.\"\n\nThe Little Red Book\n\nQuoted from the app Field Guide to Life from Hazelden Publishing.",

            "selftext": "I've been addicted to meth for a little over 2 years now. I'm gonna keep this as short and hopefully as comprehensible as I can manage; I've been up for I think 2 days and I came down hours ago. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's hard to delve into while keeping it brief and I don't have it in me to pour out the story. I have 2 best friends. One is clean now and stays with his grandmother, who won't let us hang out (she assumes I'm always strung out and thinks I got him on meth, but ironically it was the reverse). I'm proud, and relieved, and overjoyed he's doing well. The other friend, he's given up. Blatantly told me today, \"Dope is my everything. I'm just going to keep getting high because it's what I enjoy and sobriety won't solve anything.\"\n\nAnd other than them, I have nothing. I have never loved anyone as much as I love those two jackasses, we've been through everything together (from being held hostage with a machete ((tweakers, amirite?)) to backpacking to Virginia and living under a bridge for a few months), and I don't know what to do without them. I didn't have friends before, and I was heavily suicidal, I've covered myself in scars. I traded cutting for meth but met people who finally showed me how it feels to really belong and be loved. And to love someone else with all you have.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd now I've just been at my house by myself because friend 1 is at his grandma's and friend 2 now lives with his plug, I believe. Alone, for like, 2 weeks. Except for when people come over to get me high and I ignore them to paint on my walls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know what else to do. I don't have goals or aspirations for myself. Before them I was a shell of a person with no personality who drifted through life submissively becoming whatever everyone else expected of me. What is the point of being alone? I don't seem to enjoy memories if there's no one to share them with. When you die, you die alone, and if you live alone, those memories die with you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I need rehab. I'm an addict, visibly. Currently hiding my track marks from my mom and trying not to worsen the way I've carved at my face. I don't want to live like this. I don't know that I want to live. I know I can't stand to feel like this anymore. But I have no idea what I'm doing as far as going to rehab goes; I've never been. And I'm terrified. And part of me still doesn't want to go. Part of me is convinced I can still hide under the high for a good bit longer, and I almost wouldn't mind if it killed me (but realistically I am terrified of such). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease, help me. How can I push myself to choose rehab when I'm on the fence for no good reason? There is not a single reason to stay or want to stay besides being addicted. I like my needles. I like getting geeked and painting and writing and I have so much more inspiration then.. I haven't been able to enjoy my hobbies sober anymore. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd I don't know how to handle being alone. Every time I've gotten high these couple weeks, it's been out of boredom or so I could not care about how empty it is here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went on way more than I meant to. But talking to anyone directly feels like too much of my business to one person I guess. And I haven't had anyone to talk to except for my dealer for awhile. I suppose I probably needed to let my fried, sleep deprived brain pour out some of it's stress.",

Somewhere in there I lost control and it became a habit to take a couple of hits just to have something to do with my mouth/hands and now I am addicted to nicotine. I'm pretty positive the addiction is more physical than psychological. \n\nA couple of days ago my vape broke and I was like, alright, I'll just get a new one. But it was delayed and today I got pretty bad mood swings and horrible insomnia. \n\nSo I went out and bought a pack of cigs. I just got back from having a smoke and I feel awful about it. I feel like I should have endured through it but having been awake for over 35 hours, I just didn't want more of that. \n\nI don't really want to quit yet but once I get my new device I will be keeping track of how much I use it and taper myself down so that these shitty withdrawals don't happen again.\n\nRegardless, I feel horrible for the cigs thing. All my hair and my hands smell like smoke and I hate it. I know that if it keeps delaying I'm most likely going to smoke another cigarette tomorrow but damn. I don't really know what to think anymore. I'm not sure if any of this even makes sense.\n\nI wish the withdrawals were just insomnia and headaches. I can deal with that just fine. I can deal with the physical symptoms. The mood swings though? Not at all. I didn't feel like myself. I ditched some friends for a dumb small reason. I'm tired.",

So I'm a 28yo guy from a great loving (lower) middle class family in a northern european country. I stepped on the wrong side of the law at about 7yo when I started stealing cigarettes for the bit older kids. This shoplifting and other craziness (e.g. a pretty serious gambling addiction for that age) went on everyday until I was about 18yo. Went to the mandatory military service in our country (used on vacations during that time) and graduated to two different occupations in vocational colleges after that. I work here and there but my main thing is I've been using and selling speed/meth/mdma/opiates and cannabis for basically the last 10 years to cover my habit and make a bit on the side.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout 6 months ago I had a failed rehab attempt because I couldn't stand the whole \"we're sick victims who can't do anything for themselves so we need god\" rhetoric in that particular place so I left. This March I was fortunate enought to try and just go cold turkey at my parents house so I packed my stuff and stayed there for 2 months until I came back to my city. Well you already know what it's like so I won't detail how shitty I felt. Anyway, when I came back here, I've started looking for a job but no luck yet. I stayed out of the game for a week until I ran into a old friend and got something to move. Now I've been slipping for a week and been smoking  weed or had a benzo 3 times in 5 days. Luckily stayed off the opiates and speed still but I know where this is heading if I don't stop. I'm completely sober writing this but man would I want to shoot up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm waiting to start a 6 month piss test thing to get my drivings license back so I hope that gets started soon before I do something. It should be a few weeks. I should probably leave the city again until that starts..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's just so fucking tempting to get easy money especially because I have quite a bit of debt from all the criminal shit over the years. If I have a legit job, they take like 33% of my pay. But yeah this is me just making excuses. Sorry for the long post, I haven't opened up about this to no-one except my family and a few homies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny help would be appreciated since I'm having trouble seeing a point in sobriety rn even though I have a ton of reasons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks.",

            "selftext": "Idk if this is the right place to post. I was advised to come here from a mod at r/relationships. \n\nI'm really just sort of lost and jumbled right now, so I'm sorry if this comes across as an incoherent, rambling mess.\n\n**--Background info--**\n\nMy parents have always been high-functioning alcoholics. This is something I've been aware of since I was a kid. I remember confronting them about it when I was in elementary school, and getting screamed at for it. (To be fair, it was about the time I was in DARE - looking back, a really stupid program - and was being a pest about the whole thing. I almost can't blame them. Even so, I wasn't allowed to question their drinking, ever.) \n\nAlmost 100% of their problems, including their alcoholism, stem from neither of them being able to accept, acknowledge, or seek help for their problems. Mental health or otherwise.\n\nThings got *really* bad for both of them after they went through an incredibly nasty, messy divorce about 6 years ago. They're both still mostly high-functioning addicts, but it's definitely ramped up. They went from about 3-4 glasses of beer or wine every day (they were more alcoholics in the sense that they COULD NOT live without at least some alcohol every single day) to at least 1-2 bottles or 6-7 beers every day. My mom also added in Lorazepam in the last couple of years.\n\nI've always been conscious about the issue. But it was so normalized since I was little, that now I'm finally coming to terms that this is a lot worse than I thought. And I don't know how to deal with this. \n\nIn general, I have a lot of issues with my parents. They're both very broken people with a lot of mental health issues, and both of them refuse to accept this fact or get help. I'm an only child and I have taken the brunt of their emotional damage, even up until just a couple of years ago. I've been in counseling which has helped a LOT. But I'm still struggling. I'm still angry. My mother REFUSES to acknowledge or face her problems. She's content with digging her hole deeper and deeper, then whining to anyone who will listen. She's hurt that I'm no longer willing to listen.\n\n**--The core of the problem now--**\n\nMom just last week went to rehab and told me she's had hallucinations, before and during detox. But this all just feels like a temporary measure to get us off her back - she only went because my aunt begged her (after my aunt witnessed her spending $600 in two weeks on alcohol for herself), she's already said she's going to bolt right after the initial 3 weeks, and refuses to go to after-care classes. She's also told us she \"can't promise she won't still have wine\". Her head is still dug so deep into the sand she doesn't even realize how far she's gotten being IN REHAB. I also found out that she \"borrowed\" (took) thousands from my grandma to pay her bills, because she's spent so much on alcohol. She's even borrowed money from me, before I realized what it was for.\n\nWith trying to work through all of these past traumas and current issues, I'm really struggling now that my wedding is coming up in August. It was always a given that my parents would be there. It was just a fact. But now, I'm not so sure.\n\nMy father I've made a fragile peace with, but my mom I'm still struggling now that all of this is happening. I'm so mad at her. I'm hurt and sad and angry. I want to cut contact because I'm so mad, but that thought is so incredibly sad to me. I miss my mom. I miss her smell, I miss hugging her, I miss staying overnight at her house and talking with her. But the hurt and frustration is just so hard to get past.\n\nI've read a lot online about detachment with love. I don't know how to reach that stage. I just want to detach out of anger. How do I find the line between detaching to take care of myself, and detaching because I'm angry? Is it fair to her if I go low contact just because I'm angry? She's sick. It's not my job to fix her, and I know that. But it still feels harsh.\n\nAnd for our wedding, I don't want to avoid having alcohol - it's OUR day, and it's not fair to us and everyone else that enjoys it responsibly to avoid it just because of her. But I don't want to look back on that day and see my mother drinking and feel hurt and angry. What if she drives home drunk and we forever remember our wedding day for that? But I think it would shatter her if I told her she couldn't go altogether. So I have no idea what to do.\n\nHave any of you dealt with a similar situation, and how have you coped with it?\n\n**tl;dr My parents have always been messed up and I've struggled with a lot of their issues for years. My mom's alcoholism in particular is coming to a head and she's still refusing to admit it's a problem. I don't know how to proceed with my wedding coming up in August, because I don't know how to proceed in a healthy way/just reacting out of anger and hurt.**",

I have not however changed the wording of step three to remove the word \u201chim\u201d as to not over step my bounds which many will already perceive I have.\n\nI have not changed Bill\u2019s Story as it is HIS story and I didn\u2019t change any of the other stories. Only included is from the doctor\u2019s opinion until page 164.\n\nThere are parts of the book which directly refer to Bill, or Bill and Bob meeting such as in \u201cA vision for you\u201d and I have also kept these the same for their historical merit.\n\nThere are instances in the book in which other specific men are mentioned such as \u201cJim\u201d or \u201cFred\u201d. I have left these the same but in order to even out the specific genders being used as examples I have made a few characters who were not specifically named women.

            "selftext": "(Long post/personal incident) So i am so done with keeping this inside of me. Now it is time to let it all out.\n(Im gay and have been severely depressed and currently on well butrin 75 mg once in 24 hrs) I was introduced to meth by a hookup in (december 2018)who later became my friend. I smoked a little and it was fun &amp; we had fun too.I saw him again after 3 weeks. We did same. Again after month we met and did the same.\nThe first comedown was difficult but managed it anyway. I used to up my medicine from once to two times a day. That helped me cope. Maybe that helped me not to get addicted to it as well. Kind of. \nBut what has happened last week has blown my mind. There was this another guy i really liked when we first  met in 2016. I was using grindr (gay dating app) and by chance we ended up taking. I was happy. I wanted to meet him again. He was one of my best friendliest hookups so far.Neither of us was hosting. It was sad. I said to him that i really wanna see him, if not sex maybe we can meet formally. He asked me if im into chem sex? I asked u mean the ice, stuff etc? He said yes. Since i had done it already i affirmed. He said he ll text me in some time. And after sometime he responded with the idea why dont we get a room something like paying guest sort of. I signed up for it. He asked me to keep up 4k with me. \nHalf an hour later he had talked to the room onwner and asked me to get ready asap and reach the location. I had a quick shower, douched my bottom, got ready, packed my bag and put the lube bottle in it along with condoms. And 2 water bottles (i knew we gonna be needing this).\nWhile i was in uber, he asked me bring this stuff\n*sildenafil\n* 2 i/v drip sets\n* 2 500mL NS and 1 500mL Dextrose sol.\n*Dexamethosone i/v formulation\n* 5 insulin syringes \n\nOk i was all ok.  But when he mentioned syringes? Wtf. My heart was racing and i asked him why. He said be dropped by the pharmacy near to the house we gonna be in. He came on bike. I payed for the stuff. I asked him why the syringes? He said u know why. Ok but i thought we gonna smoke it. Nah it is boring he said. I was confused but i said okay anyway. When nothing works, steroids work. Still banging in my ears.\nHe bought some milk and yogurt as well.\nWhile he was riding the bike, he would continously look back. I was amazed why is he doing it. He said just looking out for spies. But honestly it was too much to look. He asked me if i was a spy? Wtf i am ur friend and laughed.\nWe reached the home, gave owner the id. And we up in the room. There was his friend too. I asked what's he doing. He ll be watching out the scene while sitting in the living room. Alright.\nWe locked the door. He took out the stuff and started preparing in luke warm water. God knows what he was doing. I was just watching him. I had a quick read about meth on some psychonautwiki site. I asked him to give me just 20mg as i dont wanna die lol. He said he has prepared this much for me. Now it was time.\nHe asked me to give me my arm. Clench my hand. He looked for veins. And he found one good one. My heart was dropping as i saw him put the needle. He looked at me. And smiled. And emptyed the whole content in me!\nIt STRUCK. i struck me so strongly. I felt like my heart stopped and then it strated racing. I was feeling dizzy. He pushed me on the bed. While i was feeling like i am going under anasthesia. Feeling light and numb. And like floating in the air. It was good tbh.\nI could see him injecting him. And he he shook his head. He had the drug in his veins now. He approached me. Grabbed my jaw. And slapped me. No i wasnt there for it. I am more of romantic guy but now i was stranded. Though i was feeling good but i still noticed it. I was helpless so i had to keep going. He asked me to blow him as if i am his wife. As if it is lolly pop just blow the fuck out of it. And he started swearing. It was all happening. He refused my condoms (we were negative but still wtf?) He was drenched in watching porn while i was sucking him. He even tried to refuse  lube too. But i tricked him that it will make him more feel good. He fucked me and it was still more rough and less fun than i wanted it to be. The horror was that he will go after every 30 seconds to see behind the curtain if there is someone. To see beneath the locked door if the owner is coming. To see through the bathroom window if there is someone spying on us. The bathroom window glass was made out of some fucking cloudy stuff!! No living man can see through that. But he was!!\nI was having mixed feeling. Joyous. Scared. Worried. It was not fun on the bigger picture.\nAfter an hour he opened the door and asked his friend to come in. That guy was not my type though. But he said he just wanna take a shot. He drugged him. And now he asked me to suck n rim his friend. I could see his bad hygiene but i was helplessly obeying him though not making him realize i am feeling betrayed and bad inside. Or it could have been really bad for me. I could have been killed by these two grown ass men. Thank goodness the other guy had meth dick otherwise he was thinking out having a DP. He was no longer a guy i wanted to see.\n\nI have no  courage left to describe the rest. I had 5mg left as he threatened if i dont blow him nice hes gonna inject me himself. I asked ok just 5 ok just 5....\n\nNext day we left. This was the worst comedown. I skipped college for 4 days. Body aches. Hyperthermic. Disgusting smell of sweat that poinsoned my bedsheets. I also developed apthous ulcers in my mouth. Later fever and pharngitis on day 6. I am my own enemy.\n Now i am doing better but now i often get flash back of that night. Of the time i was being injected. I wanna know is this a manifestation of craving? Or i am traumatised? Or both ?\nIt is day 10 and i havent been to any of my friends who take meth and i dont yet plan to go. I wanna sort out myself. I also feel scared in meeting new people for sex after this. \nWhat should i do? Honestly i wanna feel high as well. What should i take to feel high? I wanna get better too. I can't afford psychotherapy neither have the courage. Can someone please please recommend me some self help guidelines. Some detailed minor do's and don'ts? Some pdf(Except leave the meth, obviously) \nWould my craving go worse?  Would i ever be able to enjoy the same high but with something safe? \nI have fucked up myself. I wanna set the things alright.\n\n(Posted it on r/meth and not recieved a single response idk why)",

            "selftext": "I've been smoking weed everyday for almost 2 years now. If I dont have weed, my mind doesnt think about anything else other than trying to figure out how I can get high. If i dont smoke weed for a few days my body struggles to regulate body temperature, I get full after a few bites of food, I cant sleep, i get stomach pains, and I become irritable. I'm going to be starting college soon so i figured itd be best to take care of this now rather than later, when I have loans to pay off. I'd been trying to just use it less for a month so and I was able to reduce it nights only but had a hard time going any further than that so I've decided to completly get rid of all my weed and just suck it up for the next 2-8 weeks. \n\nIf I smoke some every now and then druning this time will it \"reset\" my progress? I know everyone is different, but I'm hoping someone here has done the same thing. \n\nI have no idea why my mind loves drugs so much. I'm not depressed and have never been majorly depressed. Ive had a relatively good upbringing as well. \n\nAny help is appreciated.",

            "selftext": "  \n\nA lot of loved ones come to this sub looking for advice. I was once one of you. I heard plenty of good advice here and but one word that was repeated many times was \u201ccodependency\u201d. It is absolutely true, we loved ones of addicts find ourselves consumed with trying to help our loved ones. If you are here looking for advice you have probably found out that nothing appears to be working. You keep thinking that you just need more advice on how to reach your loved one. I\u2019m sure there are some success stories out there but the reality is, you are fighting a losing battle. As long as you continue fighting this losing battle you will be hurt. I know this might seem hard to comprehend but you are better off focusing on your own life. You have probably been fighting this battle for a long time and you are now yourself unhealthy. STOP being the victim! With the exception of letting your loved one know that you love them and will help support their recovery there is NOTHING, you can do. They have made a choice (I do believe it\u2019s a choice) and until they decide to stop you are wasting your life trying to save them. STOP ruining your life worrying, STOP trying to get through to them, STOP allowing yourself to be used. It is so difficult to let go but when you do you will be happier. You probably have been unhappy for a long time and you don\u2019t even realize how unhappy you have become. The hard reality of drug addiction is your loved one is not the person you once loved. Ask yourself, would you have fallen in love with them if you knew they were stealing from you and other people on a regular basis? Would you love your partner if you knew they were selling their body to feed their drug habit? Would you love them if you knew they were lying about what they did all day? Would you love them when they are at the pawn shop selling your cherished valuables to get another fix?  Would you have fallen for them if (insert the horrible things they have done)? Face it they are cheating on you with a drug. It is so similar to if they were cheating with another person. In most cases, your loved one has a second life that they are not sharing with you. They have hidden acquaintances that they hide from you.  They are NOT the person you think they are, at least not anymore. Keep in mind one scary aspect, whatever you have figured out they are doing, that is likely the tip of the iceberg. They put so much energy into hiding things. \n\nAsk yourself do you want to be with this person? Are they really worth you being this unhappy? I know this is all hard to take in and it's unlikely if you are here reading this that it will make an immediate difference in your outlook. I understand and it took a really long time for me to face these facts. You might be holding onto hope that the next time you speak with your loved one they will just get it. They will bounce back and you will be happy again.  Don\u2019t let these thoughts stop you from being happy on your own! \n\nI know this post might get some negative responses and I want to make clear I\u2019m all for supporting your loved one in their time of crisis. I actually spent a really long time trying to do everything I could to help my loved one. In the end, if they don\u2019t truly want help there is nothing that can be done. I was turned into the victim. There is no escape from the heartbreak but you can at least lessen the negative effects. DO things that make you happy. DO find support for your own mental health, could be friends, hobbies or therapy depending on the severity. DO become active again, it's likely you have given up everything but trying to save your loved one. It will take time but you will start to feel happy again. Yes, you can hold onto hope, but the daily stress of watching your loved one throw their life away will start to fade. Once you are healthy enough start dating, you will see quickly there are people out there that want to be with you. Healthy people that want to spend time with you, that want to be honest with you, that aren\u2019t trying to use you to feed their habit! \n\nOnce you start to feel happy again you will see that you have wasted too much time. Yes, I hope that person becomes healthy and yes maybe there is still a part of me that sees a future, but I refuse to give up my life for someone that has given up on their own life. I\u2019m sorry if this offends anyone, I just want to help the loved ones.",

They've been to rehab several times over the past year and it has not helped them, and now their insurance will no longer cover it. Its gotten them into pretty bad legal trouble resulting with them being put on probation for 2 years. They've been court ordered to get a job to pay their debts and attend sobriety meetings. That was a couple months ago and they havent done much. They got a part time job for a few weeks and then took off for a few days in an effort to get clean. Since they didnt have a doctor's note, they got fired over it and didnt get clean. Since then, they have not gotten a new job, they just lay around and watch dumb shit on the internet all day nodding in and out of conciousness and im getting very frustrated. What do I do to remain supportive and also kick them in the ass to move forward in life? I want to cancel our internet services so they cant use it to find drugs or waste time, but I also feel like this is all just pointless.",

            "selftext": "I've been a heroin addict on and off for about 3 years now. It all started in 2011 when I was in a bad car accident that seriously and permenantly injured my back. At the time I was started on 10mg percocets and within 18 months I was prescribed 90mg of instant release oxycodone every day. I became so dependant on them and it became a way of life. It changed my personality, destroyed my marriage, and made me hit rock bottom (or so I thought) even though I was prescribed them and not blowing money on it. I was suddenly and instantly dropped off that script in 2015  because I tested positive for Marijuana. I ended up getting clean and was clean for almost two years. At one point in 2017 I was offered heroin on foil and I smoked it and that was it, I became hooked. That sudden relief of anxiety and the dulling of my overwhelming emotions was a feeling I had missed so much. After a few months of use I overdosed on fentanyl and that didn't stop me. I did get clean not to long after that but it was because I had lost everything including my job and all my savings. I was clean for about 10 months before I picked it up again. I used for about 5 months and went and got suboxone from a clinic. I tapered myself off subs over about 2 months even though the clinic wanted me to stay on them for 2 years. About 8 months later I picked up h again and I am still using today. I'm making a serious effort to stop but am trying to taper which is very hard for obvious reasons. I can't do suboxone without benzos due to anxiety so bad that suicide seems like a good idea. Unfortunately, doctors won't prescribe me benzos even short term to get through this. For the first time I have told myself that once I am clean that I am done and never picking it up again. I have incredible self control and am not worried about relapse, but getting clean has proven to be nearly impossible because I work 40+ hours a week and can not afford to miss work. My wrecklessness has used up all my PTO.\n\nI am posting this hoping some of you could provide advise on getting off of this without having to miss work or end up incredibly suicidal. I feel so alone with this battle and don't have anyone to talk to about it because everyone just sees me as an addict and doesn't want to talk to me, obviously because they have never dealt with addiction and don't understand it.\n\nThank you all,\n\nPhoenix One",

            "selftext": "Hi all. I recently started dating someone really great and he was very up front with me from the beginning about his struggles and his past. He\u2019s a heroin addict (it\u2019s hard to even type that) and he WAS sober for months prior to 2 weeks ago. The beginning of last week he OD\u2019d and then just Monday it happened again. The first time he told me right away and I was disappointed but mostly just worried about him. The second time he didn\u2019t tell me til the day after and I was angry. I told him from the very beginning I didn\u2019t want to be a part of all this but as long as he was clean then I would support him etc. Now I\u2019m worried and I have never dealt with this so I really don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nI\u2019ve suggested that he go to meetings and absolutely stop surrounding himself with people who are still using. \n\nAny suggestions of what I can do to help? Any suggestions in general for people who\u2019ve been in this position? We\u2019ve been together for over a month but it\u2019s gotten serious quick and I have feelings for him. \n\nTLDR; recently got into a relationship with an addict and struggling with how to be a good support and/or what I need to be doing",

            "selftext": "Im not addicted to any drug in particular just addicted to not being sober. It used to just be weed, psychedelics and occasional drinking but i got arrested for simple possession a couple months back and am on probation for the next 6 months and cant smoke weed so ive been drinking very very heavily and occasional coke ketamine and dxm because it doesnt stick around in piss as long. \n\nI honestly cant remember the last time i went 24 hours sober, its definitely been more than a year. Just with alcohol alone its probably been a couple months since i took more than a day without getting drunk and during those days it was because i was on something else (acid shrooms and dxm mainly cause i hate combining those with alcohol). Shit i bought a 50 pack of nitrous oxide chargers earlier today and its already empty.\n\nIts fucking hell but sobriety is worse so i just feel trapped in the shit. It just makes me more depressed thinking about getting sober because i really wasnt better off sober, i hadnt done any drugs besides caffeine, including alcohol and nicotine, until i was 16 and before that i was unbearably miserable 24/7. For years not an hour went by where i didnt seriously consider suicide, attempted twice but nobody knows that (not even my therapist). Im in hell now but im still mentally better than when i was sober i just dont even know what to fucking do. Ive lost 3 girlfriends because im just a piece of shit druggie, my only friends are my fellow shitheads and everybody else i know basically shunned me. Parents still havent given up but i have a feeling they will once they stop having to try (im only 18 still living with them for another few months)\n\nNot even sure what im trying to accomplish by posting here just need to vent i guess",

I am heartbroken. Even though I am not with her brother anymore she was my family for many years of my life and was like my little sister. My ex says they've already talked to her many times and that she refuses to go to rehab. She is not a bad person, she is the kindest, most humble, and just nice human being in the world, but I know she has always had addiction issues. My ex suggested I call her, and I want to call her and just tell her that I freaking love her and that a lot of people love her and want her to be happy --- and pretty much after that I don't know what to say. What do I say? Does it matter what anyone says? I am crying right now, and Im afraid if I call her Im just gonna tell her I love her and cry. I want her to get better, I just don't know when someone is addicted, is everyone coming at you just like, annoying? or is it gonna make her mad? idk. Advise? For those that have been addicted, has it ever mattered what someone who cares about you has said to you? Has anything anyone said to you ever made a difference in your recovery process????",

After years of on an off addiction between k2/spice, bath salts, and then diazepam, as I'm sure many of you here can relate, my brain just won't process stuff like I used to, can't think about stuff and process it like everyone else and just makes ya seem so stupid in work and drives ya crazy.

Getting energy drinks in response to duress is categorically false and an exercise in futility.\n2. I shouldn't get them \"Because I like them\" because the damage far outweighs the enjoyment.\n3. I need to make a clean break where if I keep starting and stopping over and over again the torment will never go away and I'll only become worn out.\n4. Once I make it 3 weeks I'll be on Easy Street.\n5. The uncontrollable force makes drinking them in moderation impossible.\n6. There are better ways for me to spend my money.\n7. I need to learn how to tolerate the duress for all future duress\n\nAnd I'm thinking I'll use the acronym 'Nate' for \"Now Apply That Effort\" to remind myself once I think of a reason not to get them I need to apply the necessary effort to follow through on that reason.",

But the incremental escalation of this problem means everytime I do it...these things somehow become more acceptable, my starting point a little further down this dark path, until I feel like I'm morally numb and consumed by this behavior.  I've wasted practically 2 weeks being completely unproductive and paralyzed b/c I keep going back to this drug.  I tell myself I won't do it today...and by mid-morning it's all I can think about.  Has anyone else's addictions taken them to awful places or to do awful things?  How do you deal with it? How do you begin to regain that sense of morality and being a good person.  I can't undo the past and wishing I'd never let it go so far doesn't help.  Self-pity is another pit I don't want to fall into.   I need help but can't tell anyone I know, what do you do in that case?  Anyway, I'll be looking through this subreddit for advice but I needed to get this off my chest.",

Accidentally opened a cupboard where they keep like supplements and meds and shit (I don't live here so I don't know where anything is). Anyways as my luck goes I open the door to see a big ole full pill bottle. I kinda had a moment of panic but i shut the door and then went and told my husband. I did not take any. Obvs he can't throw out his friends prescription so he hid it somewhere. We're only here for 2 more days. But like now I know it exists and I'm a year and a half clean and idk i can't stop thinking about it and it's really just a shit unfortunate situation. Its not like his friend new or anything, it's not like something I'm very open about. I feel really pathetic and like ashamed about this.  If you have any advice I would really appreciate it.",

            "selftext": "So I know this sounds silly but I think I\u2019m addicted to anime every since I properly got into it a year ago. I first started properly watching it as I said a year ago with Tokyo ghoul. Before that I watched some random fan dubs on YouTube and that was the extent of it and oh boy I was a huge anime hater back then. Well I started watching kinda full on but also in a way casually for like 2 months and later on I found my animelist which really I only realize now was a really bad thing. It allowed me to find so much more anime and also gave me the feature to add what I\u2019ve seen to a list and get stats which I realize now was the driving force to why I watched anime so much, the best way to describe it was to level up as a weeaboo having my statistics go higher while also being more knowledgeable about anime to me more in grossed with the community. Throughout this time my personality has really changed to and I\u2019ve found that I\u2019ve basically become everything I hated, all I really talk about is anime, all I really watch is anime, I\u2019ve also made a bunch of light novel and manga purchases. Well around 3 months ago I kinda realized I wasn\u2019t really enjoying anime anymore and thought that I was probably burnt out so I took a month break and jumped back in and realized again I still wasn\u2019t really enjoying anime, I mean I continued watching it but wasn\u2019t really enjoying it. That all leads up to today were it kinda clicked and I realized all of this specifically the my anime list and \u201cranking up as a weeb\u201d thingo and finally just knew I\u2019m not really enjoying it anymore and have become really addicted to anime as a whole... I still really wanna watch some even though I\u2019m not enjoying it as much as I used to if I ever really did, I\u2019m pretty confused about this as I\u2019m pretty sure at one point I really enjoyed watching anime besides the few recent anime I\u2019ve kinda enjoyed, other then that I\u2019m just not enjoying it anymore. So I logged out of my my animelist account as I feel that was a really big reason I wasn\u2019t enjoying anime anymore and just watched something for the sake of watching it which was \u201cHappy Sugar Life\u201d which I\u2019m kinda enjoying and watched 3 episodes of this afternoon. And while studying at my chair this evening it clicked that I\u2019m probably addicted and should do something about it... as it\u2019s become really self destructive as I want to watch it constantly though never really enjoy it so I\u2019m turning here. So sorry this was a while cobbled together mess but I really hope I can learn something from you guys as I wanna fix everything that\u2019s happened. Anyways thank you in advance :)",

I always felt insecure and had a low self esteem when it came to any sort of relationship or physical sexual nature up until I met my girlfriend. I used to use dating apps like OkCupid to flirt and eventually exchange nude photos with girls on them before I started dating her. Although she was the most loving, caring, supportive and motivating girlfriend my urges overcame me and I continued to masturbate to the nude photos I had saved in my snapchat history. As time went on I continued to feel more and more guilty about it but I could never face her and tell her the truth because I was so scared of losing her as she is genuinely vital to my life. She has guided me and given me tools to help my mental health, and been nothing but a tremendous girlfriend to me. All I want to do is make this right. We didn\u2019t breakup tonight, but I fear I\u2019ll lose her. I need to fix this. She is the only woman I see myself with. We\u2019ve spent nearly every single day together since we started dating June 5th, 2018. I need advice/tools to help 1. With the addiction I\u2019m struggling with 2.

All I'm thinking of are memes and I find myself in a pretty messed up situation.\nWhenever I'm doing homework or something I end up thinking about memes and then id go over to my phone, check if that meme was already taken, if not I make the meme and I post it on a meme subreddit and I wait for the upvotes to start rolling in and if they don't come in I feel Terrible and depressed and I make another meme and so on...\nHow do I get out of this shitty habit?",

He\u2019s made friends with this guy that is a drug dealer even though he thinks I don\u2019t know. I pick up a lot on his behavior. There\u2019s this other friend that has openly admitted to using cocaine in the past. We all hang out from time to time and all 3 disappear into the bathroom. They do it casually they go 1 by one thinking I don\u2019t notice. When we are out drinking he steps away to the bathroom maybe every 20 minutes or so and I make sure to question it he always comes up with some excuse about not knowing what\u2019s wrong with him. I\u2019ve even heard him sniff it while on the phone with me and blames having a stuffy nose. What should I do? Please help I\u2019ve been going crazy on how to address this.",

I look back, seeing the pain beneath the pride. Sobriety is a better high. Faith, commitment, reliability, resistance, successful restraint and self-control. Restraint isn't my new drug. I'm not boring... I'm free. I refuse to risk being sentenced. I realize my mental clarity is better than my vice. I lost every hour of every day since I was 14 to fear, anxiety, and crippling self-esteem. You're not the monster you think you are, if you choose to leave it behind.  8 years later, and I still remember the first time. The rush, the fear, the regret. Rinse, repeat, quit, and relapse. 8 years later, and I've lived, died, and lived again internally. I didn't think I'd be here. Here I am. 8 years from now, I'll look back at this all-nighter in the library, and realize that this is the night I left it all behind, and closed the fucking book for good. I defied all odds, and today, I leave to play it safe. 5/14/19. Goodbye.",

I tried a cup and really enjoyed it. The next day I had 2, then 3 the next day. This progressed to 6-7 cups a day, one before I left to get on the bus, one on the bus, 2 at school (my teacher had a Keurig in her room that she let me use), then 2-3 at home.

            "selftext": "My father passed away from a drug overdose back in August. Me and my brother knew it was coming because he was getting worst and worst during last summer. Me and my dad had a dysfunctional relationship. He also had bipolar disorder so his moodswings were everywhere. I seen him at his worst when he first started using heroin. I found out he was using herion because I witnessed him overdosing (the first of probably many) and when the paramedics came in the house, they asked what he took and he whispered heroin (thinking I wouldn't hear him). I was so livid with him and he was more angry of me finding out what he was doing instead of me seeing him overdosing. He always had an issue with drugs and went to rehab so many times, but he started using heroin the last 3 years of his life because it was cheaper then the other drugs he was taking. At the beginning of last summer, I barely talked to him cause it was to the point that I was so disappointed in him and it just made me upset to see the way he looked and dipping out constantly. I started talking to him again during July. Sadly he passed away on August 31st (which is ironically considered National Overdose Awareness Day). I am happy that we were on speaking terms before he passed because I know I would of felt guilt if we weren't. Now 9 months late, me and my brother are finally selling his house and it's starting to hit me. It was hard for us to do, but we have no choice at this point. Since we been through the process of selling the house, I been having dreams of my dad. Some dreams he's just there and others are him talking to me apologizing for everything. I also had multiple dreams of him overdosing and surviving each one. I don't know if this is a sign that he's proud of me and my brother or I guess it's some type of closure. i don't know if this post makes any sense or not, but it's hard to talk to anyone that hasn't been through this situation so I figured to post on here.",

Dad died suddenly about 4 months ago and I've been using all sorts of things, mainly kratom, since. Well, the drugs have run dry. I'm over a week clean from kratom and 3ish days clean from Klonopin. I am struggling so much right now. It's like I've been masking my grief with substances since it happened and I clearly haven't processed it well. I so badly want to start drinking again but I know that will only make things worse. I have phenibut which helps a bit but I'm really trying to not abuse it or use it every day. Exercise helps but only during. Can't sleep, anxiety is through the roof. Mood is like a fucking roller coaster. And to top it off I've got a big social gathering this weekend for my dad's ashes ceremony and I'm dreading it. Any advice on how to get through this?",

            "selftext": "It's actually a very specific restaurant's fried chicken, but I won't be mentioning the company for the sake of not sounding so r/hailcorporate. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFor about the past year or so, I've been eating fried chicken every week. The minimum is 20 pieces every week. For the most part I order a 20 piece on Friday night or Saturday and spend the entire weekend eating it. This almost sounds funny, but it's become so routine that I start craving it automatically when the weekend comes. Sometimes I'll eat it during the week if the craving gets so bad I can't hold it in, but that only means I'll eat it again when the weekend comes. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI've always liked fried chicken growing up, but it turned into a legitimate ritual/addiction in my mid 20's. I think it's somewhat rooted in my childhood as well, as it was often a minor-celebratory food in my family or something we ate while we all watched a movie/show together. I also have images ingrained into my mind from a childhood book of a character eating fried chicken. I remember thinking it looked absolutely delicious and craving chicken after finishing the book. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThere's probably some sort of connection with my childhood and adult-anxieties that are causing this manifestation. I think it might have to do with my subconscious desperately missing childhood emotions and feelings. Whatever it is, all I know is that I'm consuming an ungodly amount of chicken every week. I'm not sure if it's unhealthy or not as I work out consistently, but the fact that I'm posting on this sub about some fried chicken means I've crossed into the unhealthy territory of liking a food. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhat should I do?",

            "selftext": "So I'm 3 months in and feeling pretty good about it.  \n\nI changed my living environment, my career, I am back in school, started working out, started volunteering and picked my instruments back up in a pretty significant fashion. I am on mild medication that seems to really help curb my cravings (cocaine/alcohol).  Life is good and I have a lot to look forward to.  I feel lucky.  \n\nSo I am frustrated because I feel over-committed to recovery-related activities, namely AA.  I don't subscribe to the one-size-fits-all mentality or the unavoidable religious aspect and I don't appreciate the \"holier-than-thou\" scoffs I get when I challenge any of the sacred tenants of the 12 steps.  I do not believe that you need to have a \"spiritual awakening\" to stop being a piece-of-shit drug addict nor do I care to understand what that means.  I like myself when I'm not using, I like my non-addict friends who support me and I like my independence and my, albeit somewhat tragic, uniqueness.  Frankly, I would rather blow my brains out that become some vapid, brainwashed, cliche-spouting automaton.  \n\nOkay, so that's a bit harsh and I know everybody in the program isn't like that, but seriously there's no possible way that it is the only solution as many members and, sadly, therapists/doctors/rehabs will lead you to believe.  It seems like a cop-out to me.  \n\nOkay so there's my rant for today, I figured better to do it here than get side-eyed or worse at a meeting.  I'm pretty happy with the one group I go to weekly, but I am tired of people telling me that \"I'm not going to enough meetings\" and \"You owe the program so much it saved your life\".  Bullshit.  I looked at myself in the mirror, saw a hideous inhuman amoral monstrosity, realized I am almost past the point of no return and finally sought the help I needed to change my ways.  I have support.  For fucks sake I'm in an 8-month long outpatient program.  For fucks sake...can we all calm down?",

Nothing seemed to touch it. That\u2019s when codeine turned out to be a lifesaver. So she took it so she could actually get some sleep and calm down that headache.    \nThe next morning she told me she woke up at night with some crazy ass high or something.    \n    \nSo she took it the next night. Similar but not as powerful high happend. No headache.    \n    \nAfter about 4 days it started to concern me since it started becoming more of a regular thing. At least 2 per day.    \n    \nSo I started to check out things about codeine. And abuse potential. What it interacts with. And how sleeping on codeine with frequent asthma attacks can be dangerous.    \nAnd with the more frequent asthma attacks she has had.     \nMy already worsening insomnia has grown much worse at the thought of this.    \n    \nShould I mention it and if so.

The moment a temptation is really strong it causes what feels like a physical desire that has nothing to do with any emotional stress. The physical desire to relapse was so strong that even reading all the reasons I wanted to quit was not strong enough to stop the relapse.\n\nThis has scared me because it's like my addiction is so strong that it overrides me own strong motivations to quit. If it were an emotional issue, I could work on that but it feels like a chemical thing where I just need to engage with my addiction to find an immediate release.\n\nI hate this feeling of always losing despite my real desire to end this.\n\nI can't leave home and go for walks as I work from home so any ideas as to how I can navigate this?",

Ages 17-20 were by far the heaviest and I was hospitalized multiple times for alcohol poisoning. When I was 19 and 20, my boyfriend was addicted to Vicodin and I got hooked as well. After a few months of using, I realized the slippery slope I was going down, so I quit cold turkey. \n\nAfter having my daughter at 21, I still drank pretty regularly, but not nearly as much as before. It was more like a glass or two of wine every night and sometimes after my daughter went to sleep, I wanted to get a buzz from some harder liquor. \n\nAt 22, I joined a religion where drinking is not allowed, so I quit cold turkey. Since then, however, I have had several times in which I have slipped up and when I slip up, it's not just one drink- I drink to get drunk. \n\nNow, I recently had surgery and needed to take pain killers for about a week. I'm out of them now (even though I really didn't require all of what I was prescribed) and I find myself thinking, \"I'm only going to have a good day if I have that high.\" I also bought a bottle of wine last week in a moment of weakness and drank every night for a couple of nights. \n\nI would consider my addictions to be \"under control,\" as I feel like more often than not, I can say no. Maybe that's just because I'm not around opportunities to drink or get high that often, but whatever it may be, I feel okay right now. \n\nI just don't want this dependency. What can I do? I feel like a lot of resources surrounding alcohol or narcotic dependency are for people who have much more prominent addictions than I do and I don't want to take away from individuals who need more attention than I do. However, I also know that if someone were to come up to me right now and ask if I wanted a drink or if I wanted some oxy, I wouldn't be able to say no. Even though I may be in a pretty good situation currently and surrounded by people who don't offer me those things, I also want to prepare myself in the event that I am around those people someday. \n\nI would love any and all suggestions and support I could get.

I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because I hate risking hearing people discuss drugs, or if I just don\u2019t enjoy socializing as much when I\u2019m sober. Maybe I\u2019m just an introvert and didn\u2019t know it. Maybe I prefer to be alone because it\u2019s just better for me.

I am still on suboxone, and found out 7 weeks in after drinking a number of times and smoking ~20 cigs per day. we decided to have an abortion; I'm not ready to go off of sub, and even if I was, putting your body through withdrawal could have horrible effects on a baby. the decision ripped me up quite a lot but i think it was the right one.\n\nmy clinic doctor recommended a specific abortion clinic to me, and informed me that unless they used an injectable opiate, my sub wouldnt affect the procedure at all. fast forward to appt day; 15min before the procedure, after I paid up and everything, I was informed that the only anesthesia they had available was a low dose of fen. i told them that if i had been informed of this when i told them a week prior abt my meds, i would have sought out a different clinic, but they basically just shrugged and told me it wasn't their fault. they informed me that I would basically feel everything, but that everyone feels ~something~ so too bad.\n\neven with nearly triple the usual dose, I felt everything. it was horribly traumatic for me and left me feeling disgusting. my cravings have been out of control since; having horrible nightmares, texting dealers and temhen cancelling, trying my best to keep a tight leash on myself (for my sake yes but mostly my partner's). he noticed a change in my behaviour and ended up going through my phone (which I fully understand) and finding a dealer convo that was left open ended. I've never seen him so worried or apologetic before.\n\npart of me feels like he deserves more than being with an addict. he makes me happier than I've ever been in my life, but what am I putting him through? what if one day, I'm not so strong? what if I fuck up? the thought of doing that to him fucking kills me. is it selfish for me to stay with him, knowing that I could very well fuck up one day and traumatize him? \n\nwhat scares me more than anything is this; I used to hate drugs, but someone introduced me to them. they didnt even intend on me being a part of it, but it was \"revenge\" usage. if I fuckdd up and he used to try to understand me or make me feel what he felt, I could never forgive myself. \n\nI know this is a novel, but can anyone leave their opinion on this for me? am I being selfish? i dont want to lose the one person that makes me happy, but what if one day I ruin his fucking life???\n\nhelp, pls.",

            "selftext": "Sorry if this is confusing, it's a pretty complex situation. My (18F) mother (60F) has been addicted to pills and gambling since I was a kid, a little over a decade now. My dad (who got her into the pills in the first place) was her drug dealer basically, and once he passed from cancer a couple years ago she had to turn to the streets for more. A lot of drama ensued and she repeatedly ended up not being able to pay for rent, internet, and food. I just wasn't happy living in a small trailer with her anymore, so I moved in with my other aunt who is more stable. \n\nI've been living with my aunt for a couple years now, however my mom has never gotten help for her addictions no matter how many times my family and I have tried to convince her. I have cried and begged at her feet a multitude of times. Usually she doesn't have the $ for rent, food, etc., and naturally she has asked me to help out. I've had about $6000 total in college grant money the past year, and I have allowed her to take half of it. She always asked for money here and there, and it has added up over time. In fact, the few thousand dollars I received from my dad after he passed was planned to be for me, but she ended up stealing it I believe, although she says it must've gotten lost or my other crazy aunt took it. \n\nI have a poor family and all of this money was supposed to go toward my car and my future. I realize that I am enabling her addictions by doing this, but she guilts me heavily and makes me feel obligated to help her, saying things like I am picking money over her, that I shouldn't treat my mother the way I am, and if I help her just this last time she will be able to go to rehab. She is old and it's hard to think about what would happen if she was homeless. If I cut her off completely from my life, I am afraid she will commit suicide because she has talked about it before, and she always says I am all she has left to live for. She simply has no motivation to go to rehab and get better, and even if she did I'm sure she would have no willpower to stay off the pills. \n\nShe raised me with love and was a great person before all of this, but now I haven't really visited her for months and most of our conversations are her asking me for money again and again, and I've become resentful over this. I didn't want our days together before she passes to turn out in such a way. Now I guess I turn to Reddit and ask for insight and advice on what I should do moving forward. Am I in the wrong to not give her money anymore? Is it just a lose-lose situation no matter what I decide to do? Should I try to enjoy the remaining days I have left with her?\n\nTL;DR: My mother has a drug and gambling addiction, and she continuously says she will get help but never does. I have given her a large portion of my college grant money to help pay for her necessities. I know that I am enabling her, but I feel guilty and at fault if I don't help. I appreciate any advice.",

But I felt like they deserved to know the reality of what was going on at the apartment. He said I'm a snitch. I told him from day 1 I have always tried to look out for him and protect him. I am devasted. I really wanted a future with him because I know how geniune and kind he can be. He's lost sight of it , his whole world, and our world we have tried to build together in the past year+. \n\nPlease send me some good vibes.

            "selftext": "I'm a Hypnotherapist and have worked with 1200 smokers on quitting cigarettes. What I wanted to share was a perspective that nicotine may not be as addictive as first thought.\n\n1. Nicotine patches don't work, for most. Nearly 100% of people said they started smoking again, a few weeks after quitting, due to stress or socializing. They weren't looking for NICOTINE at all, they wanted to feel better or connect with people.\n2. Of the 1200 smokers I've worked with, over 1125 went on to remain non-smokers. 1-2 hours of hypnosis &amp; mindset coaching removes 'nicotine addiction'. A conclusion could be made that nicotine is no match for an empowered person or the problem never really was nicotine.\n3. 86.7% of women stop smoking as soon as they find out they are pregnant. Where does the nicotine addiction go? Does having something meaningful in your life make that big a difference? It doesn't have to be a baby either btw... It could be serving others, self-love, fitness goals, business goals, family goals or whatever is deeply meaningful.\n4. Nicotine cravings can be satisfied, by something other than the NICOTINE. Cigarettes contains 8-18% sugar depending on which brand you smoke. In my sessions I recommend clients eat regular meals including plenty of fruit and drink lots of water for the first week. Eating the fruit has a bonus effect; you aren't overeating on something unhealthy, leading to weight gain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: A person who started smoking again after quitting cigarettes for 1 week or longer, did so for reasons other than nicotine.\n\nEffective strategies for social interaction, eating fruit, avoiding weight gain, having a purpose for quitting and stress relief, all make a difference for stopping smoking long-term. It may not be easy however it can make a significant difference.",

I brought it up to my mom several times as a child asking her to leave him and she would blow me off. She could never tell me flat out that \u201cno your dad isn\u2019t a drug addict\u201d because she knew it was a lie. So she would just go quiet. However, when I turned 18 my father confronted me to tell me him and my mom were separating. Apologized for his drug use. Told me he was taking Suboxone to stay clean and he had been for a while. I accepted his apology. He also told me my mother had 2 affairs over the last 10 years. The first one, which my father believed to be a long one, was with a heroin addict in the town. The second one, with a man who does coke, who\u2019s daughters were in my graduating class. I was heartbroken. But it also kind of hit me. My mother always did strange things. Was gone way too long. Sleeps way more than is acceptable for anyone to sleep. Is very sneaky and does not leave her phone out/ gets very shaken up when we even look at it. Basically she acts like she has something to hide. My brother and I suspect she may be abusing anti-anxieties such as xanax or Valium. I can\u2019t do this all over again with another parent. What should I do? \n\nTL;DR: my brother and I suspect my mother of abusing sedative anti-anxieties. What should we do?",

As soon as I leave work to go home, I pick up something, it ranges from two shots of liquor one day, to a bottle of wine the next day, a fifth following that, always something. I tell myself over and over, I'll go to a meeting today, I'll stop tomorrow and I don't. This cycle has been going on for a few years. I think what is worse is that part of me wants to stop and another part is so fully addicted that I'm afraid to or don't want to. Its daily drinking, but not throughout the day -- occasionally it can be. I'm mentioning that because I know I'll have slight withdrawal but not to the extent that I need to go to a detox center. I really wish this desire and this feeling of necessity to drink would just leave my mind and body. Why can't I stop? Where do I achieve the will-power to do what's best for me. I already know I'm going to pick up something on my way home from work today. \n\nI here and there watch inspirational videos to be sober when I wake up in the morning. I've taken up exercise regularly but will still go and pick up alcohol as soon as I finish working out. I have seen immense consequences of this disease in my family. I have two D.U.I's. I have wrecked two cars, I've spent time in jail. What the fuck is it going to take? Why doesn't that already put enough fear and obvious reasons to abstain? \n\nI. need. help.",

            "selftext": "(PLEASE SKIP TO THE BOTTOM IF THIS IS TOO LONG FOR YOU) \n\nHello. I'm 18, and ever since I've been young, alcohol's been a big part of my life. My dad's side of the family is known for being alcoholics, and ever since I was little, I've witnessed a lot. I've seen my dad drunk plenty of times, way, way more than I can count. I've seen throw-up on every surface, seen beds wet, heard the whole house shake from him falling down into something, and just-- you get it. He's never been too physical with me, only verbally and emotionally. I've been called a lot of things, and they stick with me, but I say that they don't affect me much. He has to work a physically-demanding job, sometimes going for up to 2 weeks without a single day off, and because of this, I feel guilty putting any blame on him. It doesn't help that he does apologize every once in a while, and due to those apologies, I feel like the enemy in confronting him about his addiction. \n\nAs of the last several years, my mom has started to fall into the same cycle, but to a worse physical degree. I don't know if it's related, but she throws up at least once every day, and regularly wets the bed. She's in her early 40s, and I know in my heart that that is not normal. That is not okay. She has to raise my younger sister, who is 5 (and honestly hard to handle) and stay at home. She always asks me, when she's drunk, why I'm always angry and hate her so much. It makes me feel awful, and wonder if I really am a hateful person. \n\nLike I said, I've seen alcoholism all of my life on a daily basis, but it's to the point where I don't know if what I feel is valid anymore. I dread hearing my mom throw up every day (she tries to hide it by running the water), I hate smelling pee regularly on pillows or mattresses, I hate being scowled at or ignored, and I hate seeing my little sister have to witness them intoxicated. I worry about things like money, food, and more, and my parents only get angry at me for it, telling me that it's none of my business (but because of how unstable everything feels, I'm always anxious about those things too.) But due to the fact that we aren't in any physical danger, I undermine my feelings. (Her drinking really mainly goes on at night, with my dad.) \n\nI tell myself constantly that other people have it much worse, and that my problems aren't even valid. My situation really isn't that bad, and I'm probably chocking it up way worse in my head. That's what I tell myself. I wish that I could see a therapist that could tell me that it's okay to feel the way I do. \n\nI know that this post is way too long, and that probably no one is going to read it, but I just had to tell someone. I feel like I can't tell anyone at all, and that my situation really isn't that awful, but that I need to tell someone regardless.\n\nMAIN POINT: Has anyone else had similar experiences, i.e. parents with alcoholism? Is there any way to cope/worry less, or to stop dissociating with or undermining your problems?",

            "selftext": "I'm at a loss for what I should be doing here. My brother has been in some sort of meth psychosis since January...delusional, hallucinating, irritable, violent outbursts, suicidal/homicidal thoughts. He'll call me several times a week and talk for hours about his delusions, but it seems to calm him so I just kind of go with it and listen to what he has to say. He's gotten so bad, even a lot of his drug friends have cut off contact with him. \n\nMy mom, brother, and I, all live in different states. He doesn't talk to our mom, and my grandma cut him off, so I'm it for him. We literally have no other family, he's lost most of his friends...it's just me now. \n\nHe's living at my moms old house in the country, no electric, no water, no car, no food, no people...and the house is in such bad shape from him living there over the last year, it needs condemned and torn down. My mom called him Saturday to let him know she was having the house removed due to it's condition. He called me screaming that he was going to burn the house down, kill all of us, and kill himself. It was completely horrifyingly awful and terrifying. \n\nYesterday, he calls me as if nothing ever happened. He was calm for the first hour, but the call ended with him screaming again, cussing me, and threatening to kill me bc I won't give him money so he can build a time machine. \n\nI don't know what the right answer is here. He has no other support, but I feel like he's taking me down with him. At this point, I'm starting to think that taking his calls to listen about his delusions and hallucinations is just enabling and rewarding him. I don't know if I should save myself and jump ship...let him hit rock bottom on his own and hope he gets help, or if I should keep taking his calls just for the simple fact that he'll know he's not completely alone and abandoned by everyone. \n\nI've never called him an addict, or a junkie, or lectured him on getting clean. I wanted to be that one person he could turn to, without judgement, if he ever needed help or wanted to get clean. I just don't know what he needs. So, for those who have been in his shoes, at this point, what was it that you really needed from your family? What should I do here?",

Sure, she\u2019s not who she really is when she\u2019s tweaking, but I still like her as a person. I end up getting her number to hang out after me and my brother go see Detective Pikachu. I really didn\u2019t have any plans to go see her. Well....  I ended up cracking. I snorted a few kpins, drank a fith of liquor, and ended up hitting her pipe twice. I barely felt anything, but I still feel dirty about it. Kpins and all. 2 months down the drain. All because I got lonely. On the bright side I met some cool stoners who blew down on a sev with me. I still just feel so depressed about the situation. I woke up and started guzzling whiskey just to forget about it. I was hoping it was just a meth dream that I get from time to time.... nope.",

            "selftext": "I need advise on how to handle this, because this shit is a whole new experience for me...\n\nMy boyfriend is in denial he has a problem with Meth. He uses every single day, multiple times a day never takes any breaks for months on end. We live together. He even recently convinced me to go off my birth control so we could try for a baby. (while he was clean mine you &amp; not pregnant thank god)  \n\nThe first time around lasted 7 or 8 months. After months of making my life hell &amp; making me question my own sanity. he finally realized he needed to stop after he handed me a loaded gun while I was asleep, and made me go into the bathroom to shake hands with the man hiding behind he toilet that he accidentally just peed on. (and these are only 2 of thousands of examples) \n\nHe stopped... for about a month. Now he's gone head first again. Uses every single say with no breaks... Only on week 3 so far, but the paranoia, anger, irrationality, etc is getting pretty bad again much faster than before. I'm afraid it's only going to get worse again. He won't hang out with his friends, or talk to anyone basically.\n\nBut of course everything is my fault. He says I'm the one making him paranoid because I don't follow his rules. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've left out a lot of heartache and details but you get the gist... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs it possible for me to help him? or am i just enabling it by staying? How do I ever go about helping him because he said ill ruin his life if I make him go to rehab. Half his friends also use (occasionally) and he downplays how bad it is to them, not that he even talks to them anymore. He does not see a problem with it, and I already know I can't make him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, Is it true that snorting it isn't as bad... which means he can use it every day \"now that he has his tolerance built up again\". I've tried it after times and I just don't really like it and I have no experience on how to handle this situation.",

            "selftext": "Who has even thought about this before?  I certainly hadn\u2019t.  But let me tell you how it seems to be playing out with my family member.  Cancer treatment is not designed for addicts.  If your loved one can\u2019t stop killing themselves without cancer, adding cancer to the mix isn\u2019t going to magically make them take care of themself.  This person is on a chemo so terrible the side effects are heart failure and leukemia.  They have no immune system.  They\u2019re not supposed to even walk too briskly.  Yet they continue to use.  Yet they continue to drink.  Yet they continue to surround themselves with absolute lowlifes who slip them god-knows-what while they\u2019re dying in the ICU.  When you confront their behavior and the fallout it\u2019s causing they rage and get even sicker.  They rage at their children, saying toxic, scarring things to the precious little things who are absolutely buckling under the horror of it all.  Their apartment is continually filthy, despite multiple clean-ups in attempt to save the person from themself and the awful people who show up there to \u201chelp\u201d even after family members ask them to stay away.  Their codependent children will go absolutely manic with the extreme highs and lows of an addict-chemo-patients week.  While doctors tell them to avoid fruits and vegetables because they have no white blood cells they go home and lie in filth, putting cigarettes out in dirty dishes by their disheveled bed.  Their children will beg others not to go inside and cry when you do because you see how dirty it is again, but lucky you did because their parent is septic and would be dead by morning had you not come inside.  When you try to help their children, who will clearly be removed when the system will hurry the F up and help them, actually find a soft landing with trusted family rather than foster care the addict disowns you for \u201ctrying to take their kids away.\u201d  They tell their kids to fear you because you are the enemy\u2014causing extreme psychological stress with the disjoint from their own experienced reality.  When you complain to nursing staff about rando scruffs accessing your loved one even though you\u2019ve told them over and over again they need to be monitored if they can\u2019t be kicked out those nurses tell you \u201cthat\u2019s not the kind of service we provide.\u201d  When you ask those nurses to test their blood to see what those scruffs just gave them (in case it kills them) they simply ask the patient if they took anything and point to their denial as a reason to do nothing\u2014and disregard it as a reason for later declines.  Cancer is stressful enough.  You add addiction to the mix and it\u2019s enough to break everyone who loves you.  They should teach that to kids in those stupid \u201cscared straight\u201d shows.  You want to see why drugs are bad?  Check out the text messages my family addict sent their 13 year old child to say they\u2019re blocking the kid\u2019s phone in anger from the ICU, never wanting to see that child again.  Addicts out there, take a moment and think about that poor kid.  Get help now because some percentage of you are bound to get cancer some day.  I promise you, you don\u2019t know how bad this can get for your family.  It can get so much worse than however bad it is today.",

            "selftext": " \n\nSo I just wrote out what I have been thinking about addiction lately for a reply to a persons question on if it is ok to drink after a cocaine problem. I thought I would make a post and see if anyone wanted to poke some holes in it or say how it resonates with them, thanks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy do people become addicts in the first place? Most people who try drugs/alcohol (roughly 85%) Do not go on to develop addiction problems. So what is it with those who do become addicts? I believe it is as simple as scratching an itch or drinking water when you are thirsty, for some, substance use satisfies a psychological need. Developmental trauma doesn't mean you were physically, sexually or even verbally abused, this type of trauma comes from a child's many needs not being fully met. The child must adapt and this causes them to deny or suppress certain aspects of their self which in turn causes a subconscious distress, a feeling of being wrong in some subtle but fundamental way. This is why you often hear addicts say things like, \"I always felt I was different from everyone else, they had something I didn't.\" or \"I never got the guidebook for life.\" For a person like this life becomes more about survival and less about authentic expression of the self and this happens to varying degrees, for some it is far worse than others. When this person gets drunk or high the survival systems in the brain can finally shut down and they can relax in a way that they aren't able to sober, finally they can be themselves. This starts a love affair with getting fucked up and over time this way of coping with their pain becomes hard wired. For a person like this to stop coping by drug/alcohol use means learning a whole new way of being in the world. It can be extremely hard for them to do something as simple as hang out with close friends now that the survival system is back online and relaxing is next to impossible. It takes hard work and dedication to learn to be comfortable in their own skin and to fully authentically be themselves. Once a person like this reactivates the old coping strategy they usually find it hard to continue the hard work of sober living.\n\nThis is my working theory on addiction hope you find it helpful.",

Despised myself. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYet, after a LOT of time and suffering, and after improving myself in other ways, I finally accepted who I was. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYet, in all that time, I NEVER spoke to ANYONE about the truth, about how I felt. \n\nI didn't have that courage. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter all, the things we dislike about ourselves are often embarrassing, private, and buried deep within. These are the things we go out of our way to hide from the world. To speak about them openly and honestly? Wow....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, I'm writing this today for one reason: I carried around those \"bricks of the soul\" for 15 years. They caused me to make poor decisions, some of which caused permanent damage to my health and well-being.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYet, what's done is done. I can do nothing but press-on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut, I often think, \"What if I HAD that courage?\"\n\n\"What if I spoke to someone about how I was feeling?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know for a certainty how much it would have helped. \n\nMaybe it would have left me only needing to \"carry those bricks\" for 14 years, as opposed to 15 years. \n\nOr maybe... just maybe... I could have found acceptance, and begun to \"beat\" my addiction, VERY shortly-thereafter.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess I'll never know, but like I said, it's too late for me...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut... what about you? (if applicable.)\n\nSometimes, to save your OWN life, you need to be heroic, courageous, and honest. Don't let acceptance come on it's own time and accord. Go get it, go fight for it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wish you all luck &amp; love,\n\nMP",

It\u2019s been almost a month since my last smoke and half a year since my last drink and I feel absolutely amazing. \n\nThe driving for me to quit alcohol was my performance in university had gone down significantly and as a result I failed and had to start all over again, not only that I felt my body getting weaker and weaker and my skin looking disgusting every morning. \n\nAs for cigarettes, I could easily smoke a pack a day. Cigarette was a huge part of my life, so much so that I started bumming them off people, picking them up from the ground, and rolling up old tobacco from cigarette butts, it was embarrassing. Every night when I sleep I had to sit up straight to breathe properly and it got so bad that my entire body would go numb and tingly.\n\nI was the extreme example of addiction I guess you could say, I was diagnosed with anxiety and ADHD which made the quit even harder, but I made it in the end. It was shocking how amazing I felt even after a couple days. It was like I was living a new, healthier life. This wasn\u2019t because of Jesus, muhammad, moses, buddha or vishnu, it was my own decision to quit and my own dedication to the quit which made it happen.\n\nHow did I do it? Avoid smokers, meditate, exercise, jacking off, having sex, playing games, focusing on your hobbies. These are the things which got me through this.\n\nGood luck everyone.",

I never want someone close to me to go through that. In my opinion, the hardest feeling someone will ever go through in their life is losing forever. \n\nWhen it comes to thinking of my parents, my mom is one of the strongest people I know. She\u2019s loved and she\u2019s lost. Growing up, she lost her father at age 7. He died from overdose. That news didn\u2019t hit me as hard as a kid when she told me about it, I didn\u2019t really think of death  as a sentimental feeling but instead as a routine of life. Yea we all die at some point so why does it matter so much? \n\nWell to answer my own question, I grew up. I found love. I found happiness. I found out what freedom was. The choices I make don\u2019t just impact me but others around me. My eyes didn\u2019t open up till I started to lose the ones I loved from the same things I was going through: drugs, alcohol, depression. \nWhat made them different from me? Why was their life taken but not mine?\n\nIt didn\u2019t happen at the snap of a finger, it took me a couple years after losing these friends and family to finally realize what I needed to do. I needed to stop drowning and swim. I needed to get out of the deep depths of the ocean and swim to shallow waters, where it was easier to breathe and stand on my own. This isn\u2019t easy, it took a change of life.\n\nI\u2019ve only been a month sober, but it\u2019s really opened my eyes. Like I said before, it\u2019s not about me ever, it\u2019s about the ones I still have in my life that care about me. That will be lost if I were gone. I do this for them, not me. I haven\u2019t had this clear spaces head since I was 16, and I\u2019m 21 now. I feel good. I\u2019m still hurting yes, but it\u2019s good pain. It\u2019s pain that shows me that I\u2019m doing something right",

            "selftext": "I've consumed huge quantities of sugar for most of my life and I'm getting to the point where all I eat is sugary foods. I don't even have a normal diet anymore because I pretty much stopped eating cooked meals. I just want to eat sugar. All I crave is sugar. Chocolate, cake, muffins, candy, soda, wafers, marshmallows, this is pretty much my lifestyle nowadays. And I feel like I have no appetite for \"normal\" foods anymore so I keep stuffing my mouth with sweets all day. Lately, it has become worrying because I haven't eaten normally in about two weeks. I drink lots of soda and I can't drink my coffee unless it's sweetened like hell. I know this is taking a toll on my weight, physical health and mental health but I can't stop. I've gained so much weight it's incredibly sad. And I'm probably on my way to developing diabetes if I haven't already. I'm at a loss and don't know what to do because at this point I am basically self destructing. I don't know how long I can go without developing serious health issues and I'm scared because I can't stop. The cravings are too bad. And if I stop eating sugar, I'm going to feel like shit all the time and I know it's just a matter of time until I go back to eating sugar soon again because I wouldn't be able to survive  without it for too long. I feel like there's nothing I can do to escape from this vicious habit and it's making me extremely miserable.",

Looking for advice and posting as a general warning to anyone\n\nAdderall is ruining my life, and I do not have the willpower to stop it.\n\nMy adderall journey began senior year of college. I began taking a friends 20mg xr here and there. Whether to study or to party, I fell in love. I felt superhuman and all my anxiety/self doubt was gone. I got a good career out of college and started working right away. I went to the doctor and told her I couldnt focus at work (which was a lie), walked out the door with a 15xr script. I couldn't believe how easy it was.\n\nI started off taking one a day. Then would take an extra here and there because, hey, its prescribed by my doctor, I can control it. It went from one to two to three a day to eventually I was running through a script of 30 in a week. I have to buy more from friends who dont even know I have my own script.\n\nI dont sleep for days, drink too much, abuse nicotine, and do very questionable things while tweaking that I would never normally do (sexual regrets). I am destroying my body and mind, and also relationships with my great family and amazing girl friend.\n\nI have been able to hide it so well from everybody. I am a star at work, no coworkers have a clue if Im 3 days into a binge because I can hide it. Im manipulative. I have gone to work super fucked up, I dont know how no one has notice my tweaked eyes on constant fidgeting\n\nI want to get off this train, but I am afraid I cannot function without it anymore. If Im not on adderall I cant focus at work and just fall into a deep fog in my life. But on adderall I am just zooming through my own dark world. I cant imagine life without it anymore, and its terrifying. I wish I could control it but I have become weak and depressed.\n\nCurrently home \"sick\" on mothers day because Im recovering from a binge. Im a total POS. On my last half 20 instant release, fearing the come down.\n\nIf anyone has any advice or comments Im all ears",

He has gotten clean multiple times, but relapsed yesterday.\n\nAs I mentioned in the title, he required open heat surgery last fall to replace a valve that was destroyed due to a blood infection caused by his heroin use. He was in the hospital for two months receiving a daily regiment of antibiotics.\n\nThe doctor that treated him told him that if he ever uses again, this will happen again. They will not treat him again.\n\nI\u2019m in NY and he is in MD. Unfortunately my parents have to deal with most of this. I feel so bad for them...they are retired and should be enjoying their lives.\n\nBut anyways, I feel like he needs in house rehab. He\u2019s never done it before, and I think it\u2019s the only thing that might save his life.\n\nAm I wrong in thinking this? I feel like we are all out of options.\n\nAnd if in house rehab is the way to go...how can I help out and try find the right one. I want to do everything I can from NY and try to help out my parents.\n\nSorry if this isn\u2019t the right place to post.\n\nWe\u2019ve been dealing with my brothers heroin addiction for so long now, but I\u2019m not gonna give up on him. I love him, and I just want him to be happy. \n\nThank you for reading. I appreciate any advice. Have a great day everyone.",

            "selftext": "Hey.\n\nI am F27. \n\nEver since I've known my bf he's been drinking lots and partying hard. We both come from a scene where this is pretty much the norm and many does it.\n\nI do it. Sometimes. When I am at a festival I do drugs and I party for days, but I leave it there. I don't do it weekly or even monthly. \n\nI don't mind partying, I don't mind an occasional three day alcohol and drug binge. But my bf will at the first and at every opportunity go out and stay out. For days. He's been out for three days now and it happens almost every weekend. Sometimes it's even four days in a row. \n\nI am torn between my emotions about it. On one hand he can do what he wants, he's not violent towards me or anyone, he is not stealing or anything, but on the other hand I wake up crying when he's not next to me because he's still out and I fear something has happened to him. I fear he'll stay out forever. \n\nI come from a family with substance abuse problems and I've always said, I cannot be in a serious relationship with an alcoholic. Because you cannot trust them and they will hurt you. Still, here I am. \n\nMy biggest fear is losing him because I have to look after myself, but when is enough enough?\n\nI have brought it up several times and he either dismisses it or is defensive, making up excuses for why he is staying out and taking coke fx: it would take him 1,5 hours to go home and he was too tired to stay awake on the train so he stayed at the party (and got even more wasted and took more). He will also say: I am always tired so when I go out I like to take coke so I can stay up.\n\nI hate these things he says. I know that these things are bullshit and he is making up excuses for himself to feel better about it. \n\nI don't know what to do. I need to talk to someone about it and I need some real advice on how to deal with this. \n\nI've been thinking about kicking him out without addressing it other than telling him that his addictive behavior is why I can't be with him.\n\nI love him greatly and deeply but I don't think he'll change his behavior even if I try to really explain what is going on and how it makes me feel. He hasn't when I've tried previously. \n\nWhen I say I fear for his health, when I tell him about how cocaine alters your brain, when I tell him how alcohol affects you and your health long term, when I tell him how anxious I get, when I tell him that because of family history I am very sensitive to behaviour regarding addiction, he says I'm making it worse than it is, that he doesn't have an addictive personality, that he does it to relax and have fun etc etc.\n\nHe is not hearing me and it breaks my heart. \n\nIt is worth to mention that we both see life a little different from many people. We don't want kids, we don't care about careers or money. We don't want what most people want from life. If this is what he wants to do with his life then who am I to try and change him?",

Heavy drugs are gone, weed is out of my life, I drink occasionally but with extreme moderation. More than 2 beers and I know I'll wake up 6 months later from a gigantic bender.  \n\n\nMy process was exchanging substances for exercise, eating correct (and trying to condition my brain to just LOVE eating proper food), forcing myself to get routines, a regular sleep schedule, etc. Just following what I always knew, that my perceived depression / anxiety most likely was caused by my bad habits.   \n\n\nBut instead of feeling \"free\" I'm constantly in the loop of becoming addicted to something. A musician, a new hobby, a new game, a new sport, sex, biting my nails, you name it. I can't enjoy anything in moderation, everything goes to the extreme. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWorst of all is how I'm completely aware of it and all attempts of finding some sort of peace/harmony/balance in my life gets replaced with months of mania on whatever caught my interest.   \n\n\n\"Oh so you're gonna get addicted to this now? Just stop. You know what's going to happen.\" \"Yeah but you also know it's inevitable\".  \"No it's not. I can stop whenever I want.\" \"Why are you kidding yourself? You've been through this a thousand times. Just try to do it in moderation. You don't need to neglect your surroundings for a week because you discovered Star Trek\" \"Shut the fuck up\" \"No excuses, you know you're only trying to rationalize what you're gonna do\".   \n\n\n\\*Spends entire weekend in the couch watching 35 episodes of some shit because otherwise 200 bucks will go to god knows what\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe cycle never stops, I just replace one addiction with another.",

            "selftext": "Hey guys.\n\nI also posted to r/stopdrinking but thought I'd post here as well in hopes of getting some insight into overcoming my problem.\n\nI've been trying to get completely sober for the past 17 months. I feel like I finally have a pretty good grasp on what is needed to escape this trap and I have been getting pretty close on breaking free completely but there is just one problem area and that is the drive home.\n\nI'll try to be brief.\n\nWhen I dipped back into booze at the beginning of 2018, I created an extremely powerful habit that I'm finding incredibly hard to overcome. The cue is driving home from work. The routine is pick up liquor and beer and cigarettes. I then proceed to drink non-stop when I get home, while smoking one cigarette after another after another while playing a highly addictive casino-like video game. By the end of the night, I feel ravenous and order some nasty food, over-eat on comfort food and then pass out. I feel like this must completely flood my brain with an insane amount of dopamine and that is why it is so hard to break.\n\nI can literally be in my car and about to drive home from work and feel completely fine and I feel fine the majority of the car ride home but then when I get about a mile away from my house, all of a sudden a switch goes off in my brain and I feel like I'm possessed, pleading with myself not to do what my inner demon is doing.\n\nI've been able to overcome this quite a few times by staying calm, accepting the strong drive, and then I negotiate with myself, offering up other rewards like proposing to myself, \"we'll just have some ice-cream and watch a movie\" or something to that effect. That works for a while but it never lasts and I find myself always eventually losing.\n\nThis habit has been created and repeated for these past 17 months. I feel like I'm calm the entire day and when I feel anxious or any other triggering effect, I feel like I can easily manage and allow the feeling to dissipate in a healthy way. But the drive home is a whole other animal. If I manage to make it home Monday through Thursday, Friday is the biggest bitch of them all, and the anxiety usually doesn't wait until the car ride home but starts up a little after lunch time. By the time I'm actually driving home on Friday, the demon is already in control.\n\nBeyond negotiating with myself with other rewards, I'm going to try a new strategy which is to fail small. That is to allow the behavior but do everything in my power to make it less impactful. Such as rather than getting both the liquor and the beer, just stick to beer. Or since I'm always trying to quit cigarettes and booze at the same time, maybe just say to myself, \"you just need a cigarette\" and relapse on nicotine but stay sober. That way the fail is just a few smokes rather than a whole pack and a bunch of booze.\n\nI'm so proud of how I've at least gained the power to overcome almost any other situation. This is the only area I'm struggling with.\n\nIf anyone can offer any other advice I'd appreciate it.",

I hung up the phone and she went ballistic - told me bye/fuck off several times, threatened to get \u201cdrunk as fuck\u201d and then she would \u201cblackout\u201d. Even before we got together, I\u2019ve been extremely patient, forgiving, understanding about her situation, I\u2019ve done nothing but try and help and it just keeps coming back to this situation of just complete disregard and not respecting what I\u2019m trying to do and I\u2019m just sitting here wondering how to respond because I haven\u2019t other than in the middle of the tangent when she kept calling me (a spurt of 15 times) and I answered, told I love her and goodnight and that we would talk today so I guess I\u2019m just wondering if anyone advice on how to approach the forthcoming conversation. I\u2019m going to address the obvious and I\u2019m not the type of person to get mad so any advice would be appreciated. I also typed this out for therapeutic reasons so thanks for the outlet :/\n\nTL;DR - alcoholic girlfriend went on a drunk tangent last night, threatened to blackout and again, disregarded what I\u2019m trying to do in several ways.",

It's gotten so bad that I drink at school and If I have alcohol at home I drink in the morning to make this Life enjoyable. Life is just dull and boring. 98% of people bore me, are uninteresting and I don't want to live in a world like that to be honest. When I am drunk I feel a little different. I still know I can't make my dreams a reality but I also don't care so much. All trauma can't hurt me. To be honest.i don't even act too different, Just Not depressed. Most people can't Tell I am drunk even after some shots of vodka of several cans of beer at school. I do better in school drunk because I am not scared of saying something wrong or ask a question in class. I am a shit being basically.\n\nAlso, I am 20 now and had my First drug ecperiences when I was 16. I remember I felt super fucking happy being stoned and drunk that night. Like my childhood was back again and I hadn't to deal with all of this growing up bullshit becoming a slave. I wonder if some people also feel a little more like a child when they do drugs or alcohol? I really hate this world and don't know what to do change it. I hate what I do, I don't have realistic Dreams, might as well die.",

Are there better ways to go about hanging out and being there for the friend? \n\nI'd offer to hang out with them one to one as we get on well but sometimes in the past when they've been using they've been suggestive about making moves at me (nothing bad, but basically just unrequited affection) and I don't really want to hang out with them on my own if they're likely to do it again as it would make me uncomfortable. \n\nWhat would be your advice on how to still see them socially in a way that's best for them while they're dealing with addiction and trying to get clean?",

            "selftext": "My live-in boyfriend of three years had a bad night of drinking last week and he woke up the next morning and realized he is an alcoholic. He said he knew he wasn't ready to stop cold turkey, but that he wasn't going to drink any liquor, just a couple of beers in the evening to wean himself off. \n\nA few days later, he had a bad day at work and came home with a bottle of whiskey. I told him not to drink it, but he did anyway. The next day we talked about it and i told him he had to take this more seriously or this could be the end of our relationship. He said one day of relapse wasn't going to set him off of his intended path, and that he was still committed to curbing his drinking. The other night I suspected he was drunk, but had no real evidence. Tonight, I suspected he was drunk and found a flask in his pocket. \n\nI've never really had an addiction other than cigarettes, so I don't really know what he's going through. I want to be compassionate to how hard this is for him, but I also know I cannot be an enabler, and I can't stay in this relationship if things don't improve. His drinking has caused/contributed to lots of other issues in our relationship. Breaking up with him the week he recognized he has a problem would seem particularly cruel and would almost certainly lead to a downward spiral for him. How can I be loving and supportive while maintaining my own sanity?",

So why can't I get my shit together?! Felt so good coming home from jail, was locked in my cell 60 days while I was there and went on this mental journey of self discovery..... Had a plan when I came home and was determined to get my life back,  yet here I sit. Naked in a motel with my bug out \"best friend\" waiting on my next hit.  I am in a bad spot mentally today.  I really am sick of all this bullshit and want to do what I need to do to get my life back but at the same time I am stuck and really can't just walk away like I know I need to and today really want to.......  Ugh,  I am a total piece of shit!",

            "selftext": "On today's episode of My Strange Addiction...\n\nWhen I was 8 years old I got a bad case of windburned lips. I applied Vaseline and Chapstick to make it feel better. Very soon after, I became entirely dependent on Chapstick.\nI applied and apply it every single day, and suffer withdrawal symptoms if I do not. It has been over 15 years and there hasn't been a single day when I haven't applied Chapstick. My literal greatest fear - greater than losing my phone or my wallet - is being stranded without a stick of Chapstick. \n\nFor example, if I spend too long without Chapstick applied my lips start to physical crack and become visually dry and flaky. Actually, it's not so much my lips but the skin directly around the lips that suffers the most. Once I reapply Chapstick there is immediate relief.\n\nCuriously, I have switched dependencies on different types of lip balm material. For a while only Vaseline did the trick. Then it was only Chapstick. In desperate times, any sort of oily substance will do the trick, but it almost HAS to be Chapstick.\n\nOnce I tried using Burt's Bees because it was all natural. I ended up suffering some pretty severely cracked lips. Once I went back to Chapstick things got immediately better.\n\nThese days, I read that Chapstick has some chemicals in it that dry out lips even more. Thus, I have recently transitioned into Aquaphor, which is supposed to not have these chemicals.\n\nFor the first week or so Aquaphor did NOT work, and I had to keep wiping it off to reapply Chapstick. However, I am at the point now where Aquaphor certainly does the trick.\n\nHowever, Chapstick ultimately still feels the best and is the best way to get my \"fix.\"\n\nFor a time when I was around 13-15, I could get away with applying Chapstick only once per day. However, these days I need it every 4 or 5 hours, or after every meal if I wasn't careful in wiping any of it off.\n\nI would like to break this addiction but going cold turkey is simply too painful and I don't have the willpower either.\n\nAny thoughts on how to proceed would be great. I plan on going to boot camp next year and I don't want to have a Chapstick addiction to be another thing to worry about.",

That was great. The other issues worked themselves out. Over time. But forgiving her and seeing the beauty and love was impossible when I was angry. I\u2019m a pretty sweet guy. I really am. I was angry because someone I loved with my whole heart was dying right before my eyes . Now my best friend might be going down the same road. I do tons of fun stuff. Work hard and am very happy . I\u2019m not sure about my best friend of 20 years. She might or might not be angry. I wanted to talk to her tonight about a big work thing. We work together. Have for 20 years. It\u2019s where we got to know each other and be friends. I might have to ask her if she thinks feels she has a problem. And I just had an angry conversation with her in my head. I\u2019m not a teller. I do stuff with kids and dogs because it\u2019s so much fun. When we tried to get my wife help she felt we were angry . And we were. But we didn\u2019t yell. We just loved her and tried to get her help. I really hate being angry. I seldom do get angry. Just irritated. I want to not be angry at all at my friend if we have to have that conversation. I love her and want whatever is best for her. Any feed back would be greatly appreciated. Feels better just to talk about it. Thanks if you read.

            "selftext": "https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/8ubyvs/out_of_ideas_and_out_of_patience/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app\n\n\nI linked in the comments my very first  post to reddit. I\u2019ve always been kinda skeptical about posting so much but it honestly feels good communicating with you guys. So thank y\u2019all! ANYWAYS. \nWhen I last posted it was about a year ago. My cousin who used to do meth when we were teens, had started doing heroin(actually started sometime in 2017 and used it into 2018) so about 2 months after my post on reddit(July 2018) my cousin decided to go back to meth. Not that heroin isn\u2019t bad, because I KNOW IT IS, but meth is just a whole new ballgame for her.. she started stealing from us again, saying she will kill her self, mad at us for not understanding her, lying to everyone, became a prostitute, and wasn\u2019t worried about us while doing it.. well of course my cousin got involved with some bad dudes\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f, and ended up deciding it was time to move, so before taking off she steals money from her brother, and attempts to steal from her mom again too, the whole time telling us it\u2019s all of our fault that she\u2019s leaving, that we can\u2019t make her feel comfortable, etc. so; she takes off to Houston(October 2018) with her pimp and his friends and ends up getting busted. Charged with POSS W / INT DEL / MAN / DEL PG1 &gt;=4&lt;200G (F). So she REALLY fucked herself this time. At this point, most of my family had kinda backed off from speaking to her or trying to be there for her, just because by this point over the span of about 5-8 months have been nothing good for any of us, from her stealing to dropping her drugs around our grandmothers home, to now being in jail and probably facing prison time, I went against my better judgement and decided, she needed me, her cousin. Someone that has ALWAYS stuck by her side. So I put money on her books, I make sure to keep money on her card to call me, I go drive down to Houston and see her. Really hoping that these things will matter to her, because if I was on the other side of that glass I would want someone to come keep me sane. \ud83d\ude1e. So she somehow only got 4 years of probation and was in jail for a month before she got bailed out by her pimp, so now it\u2019s November 2018, she is a month sober and I was feeling really good. I was hoping that was the reality check she needed, but it wasn\u2019t. So at the beginning of December she moves back to Dallas and comes to stay at my house, only for me to notice she\u2019s tweaking. The part that makes me the craziest is that after everything I\u2019ve done for her, she has the audacity to do it in my home, then lie to my face when I ask her about it. So again, I go against my gut, and again I get a big slap in the face when she is back to her old ways.. so she probably goes on about a 3 week binge, not really sure how long because at this point I had tried my best to keep communication low, she had moved in with her friends that do drugs and was doing idk what, but then she calls to let me know she will be going to rehab at the end of January. I was thinking it was because she was ready to change but it was court ordered since she  failed her drug test with probation. So off she goes to an inpatient rehab, which she has been to before, so she goes and she\u2019s about a month or so sober. I was happy thinking even if I don\u2019t speak to her much anymore it\u2019s good to know she\u2019s finally starting to change a bit, so I start to come around and open up again to her more, show her some support, as soon as I start talking to her I\u2019m immediately annoyed\ud83d\ude13.. the stuff she cares about is so stupid to me, like she\u2019s telling me about how she wants to buy these new pair of nikes, and how she needs someone to pay her phone bill, how if her family accepted that she did drugs she wouldn\u2019t be there, and how she\u2019s talking to a guy in rehab, how she can\u2019t wait to leave and just is completely not focusing her energy on things(in my mind) I feel she should be focusing on, I try to take a step back and just realize I can\u2019t complain about everything you know? Try to just listen to the \u201cstupid\u201d things she\u2019s telling me. But then a month after(March 2019) she tells me that she is pregnant with the guy she\u2019s been talking to in rehab \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f, as well as mailing me a letter telling me that she is sorry for the things she has done. This is after I haven\u2019t really been speaking to her so I can\u2019t tell if the letter is genuine but at this point it is a letter I have asked her for since she was in jail. What I\u2019m basically getting at is, do I sit here and continue to keep this huge space between us like I\u2019ve been doing, or do I start supporting her now that she is pregnant with a 40 year old dude from rehab? As far as my knowledge she is still sober, and was upset when I asked her if she was for sure going to stop this time... which I didn\u2019t try to do, I just don\u2019t put anything past her now. I feel guilty for how I\u2019ve been towards her, i feel like I\u2019m being negative about whatever plans she does have, because I think most of what she does isn\u2019t a good idea. I\u2019ve finally learned I can\u2019t control her and my emotions can\u2019t either, I just feel kinda torn on what I should do. \n\nI\u2019m sorry this was so long, just needed to give a little update, but please share your thoughts! I\u2019m very open minded and understanding but this last year was really hard on me. I\u2019m all for supporting addicts and making sure they\u2019re not alone, offering advice and helping. But I\u2019m just kinda confused when it comes to my own family because I take it so personal, she\u2019s burned me more then 1000 times and what if she isn\u2019t done? Even after her baby is born or before?.. I tend to overthink a little too much \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0fanyways! Please drop any/all advice! \n\nThanks \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb",

I was going to nap and smoke one final time; but instead went and got vitamins and supplements to work out and get myself health conscious and learn to be confident with myself. Despite beating myself up over what I've been doing to myself; my confidence went from 0 to a hard 68 after treating my 28 year old guy self to a relaxing spa day with a full facial. I felt more confident and in love with myself than I ever was from any drugs or sex after devoting an entire day just taking care of myself.\n\nFor the past hour I have been staring at this loaded piece in front of me, and I can't even bring myself to even touch it. I'm legitimately worried that it has been obvious; and even though I have three days off after tonight to clean out my system if I don't get dropped a random; I still can't bring myself to take even one hit...\n\nAnd the way I'm going to do this is by not focusing on using and instead focusing on improving myself so I don't go back to this point ever again. I am nowhere near rock bottom but I don't want to go back there. After telling myself I'm done for the last week and a half... I think I'm finally doing this",

My drug of choice was heroin and to be completely honest here, I fell in love with it from day one and loved it knowing that it could take everything from me, and boy that's exactly what it did!  In the beginning, I thought I could never turn into a junkie but in the end, that's what I turned into. Lying, stealing, cheating and more lying, stealing, cheating was my daily routine and at the time it was all about what I need to do so I wouldn't get sick. I did horrible things to my closest friends and family. I stole and cheated on the love of my life because I fell in love with heroin and I allowed it to over power me and fall slave to it. Very badly. I lost everything, my girlfriend, my car, my brothers, my home, overdosed twice, anything of value got pawned and sold for dope and the real kicker is that after losing pretty much my life, I still wanted to get high. I lost everything, I did not want to go on living and tried to take my own life because i didn't see a way out. I had hit rock bottom. But im here to say that that i have 8 days sober and i will be going to rehab starting tomorrow. i cant change what i have done in the past all i can do is try to make up for it. Im moving on with the next chapter with my life and, for the first time in a long time, im excited!!!!! thanks for listening reddit. see you guys on the flip side",

            "selftext": "So I put off my impacted wisdom tooth extraction wayyy to long.  Finally got the courage to address it at about 2.5 months sober.  \nIt ended up being two complicated and invasive surgeries.  I was aenesticized for the second (they say I kept saying \"I'm tripping balls\" and talking about Game of Thrones on the nitrous, sounds right).  The first day after each surgery was painful and I took Percocet along with the other pain-relievers.  \nI took precautions.  I made people aware and we're checking in with me for the days after. I even gave half of the small script to my friend to hold after the first surgery.  I have a couple left, I trying to use them responsibly.  \nOpiods weren't my DoC, but I have been hooked on dope a little before (non-IV).  People on AA insisted that I try to go without painkillers, but this seemed extreme to me.  I didn't see why I should make myself uncomfortable after am already stressful situation.  \nTo be completely honest, I took a few more than I probably needed to.  I don't like pain and it was nice having a little break. I enjoyed them. People in AA told me that if I didn't take them \"exactly as prescribed\" that I was \"breaking my sobriety\".  I think that's bullshit.  I was in pain, I was prescribed them PNR, I took them for pain and I made sure to not get hooked and asked for help.  \nSo technically, according to some, I should reset my date.  I could care less to be honest.  Way I see it, I knew.the risks, took precautions and in the end still prefer sobriety.  I think it's a win and I should just keep moving forward.\nAny thoughts?\n\nTL:DR- I didn't take my post-op prescription exactly as prescribed but don't think that counts as a relapse.",

I've been in recovery for 17mo but relapsed nearly 10mo ago. I am on suboxone, never lost my full carries (it was planned; I waited until full carries so I could use without losing what I had gained). \nrecently, I started dating someone that has no experience with addictive drugs (aside from weed/nic). I have recently been having a tougher time keeping a leash on my cravings, and I dont know if I can guarantee that I won't slip up. \nmy question is; if you were in my shoes, would you consider breaking up w this person a service to them? the last thing that I want is to instill any type of curiosity or the oh-so-common \"revenge\" usage if I were to fuck up and he found out.\nI thought I could protect him from this side of myself but recently, after noticing a change in behaviour and out of worry for me, he went through my phone and found my dealer convo. so, clearly, he would most likely find out and be horribly hurt (for good reason) if I were to slip up. \nI dont know what to do. i love him but i dont want to hurt him. I feel like it isnt right to bring him into this world. \n\nany advice?",

I went ahead and quit my job to cut my funds and keep me from procrastinating.

Obviously the money didn\u2019t last as long as I thought and I\u2019m nearing the end planning on going to detox this weekend or beginning of next week. Aetna wouldn\u2019t cover full cost of rehab so going to a state funded one that\u2019s 140 days inpatient. Detox is required for entry so found a separate 10 day detox center I go to first. Never been to rehab so idk how true this is if someone can give some insight but the guy I talked to at the rehab center said while in detox I\u2019ll be given a case worker that will get all the info they need and I will transfer straight from detox to rehab. Currently living out of my car so that was my main concern is after the 10 days is up that there won\u2019t be room and I\u2019ll be kicked out back to the streets and now jobless. I know resources are limited for state funded rehabs but was hoping for some advice from other polyaddicts if rehab is necessary or even helpful.  I\u2019ve tried to quit before but i know for it to work this time I\u2019m going to have to get help beyond just my drug use and talk about some of the reasons why I use and feel the way I do to begin with.",

I'm listening to podcasts and reading books and other people's stories on here all relevant to addiction and gambling. I suppose what I'm saying is that I'm scared of doing something stupid.

His doc is heroin but uses meth together and downplays the meth use more so focuses on his doc being a problem. He has lied so beyond frequently about getting clean that i lack trust in knowing if he really is clean. He finally got in an outpatient program to get clean. Before leaving to go to inpatient he swore he was clean a month before going. I never seen any track marks but had high suspicions. My dumbass thought id trust him and allow him at my house a few times for the first time since ive been with him. I had a lot of suspicions prior to him going to inpatient about him using drugs. I was under the impression he needed to be detoxed off everything methadone and suboxane being an exception. He is now out of inpatient and something at my house was noticed to have been missing suspected to have gone missing before he went to inpatient. I recently found out he was smoking meth all along before going to inpatient and i am sure all the suspicions i had were accurate. I did not know the social worker meant that he needed to just be off of opiates.\nNow that he is out his attitude flip flopped he no longer is agitated he is more responsible and shows to be a much better person he has life in him something ive never seen before since we have dated. \nIm going to need to address the stolen item that was my roommates. Im heartbroken to find this all out because i know deep down inside i cannot trust him and he needs to focus on his recovery me in the picture is probably a distraction even considering im apparently what motivated him to clean up.\nI guess this is more of a rant and not much of a question. I think i just need someone to listen and talk to about this mess.",

            "selftext": "Hi! I just need to talk about a few things with a community that understands and can offer real advice. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I'm dating a man who has struggled with addiction to meth since he was a teenager. He's 30 now. He was clean for about seven years, up until last year, when he started using again. Today is day four of him being clean again. He's going to NA meetings daily at this point and isn't drinking. He smokes weed still. He doesn't do coke, LSD, meth, or heroin anymore. So he's recovering. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm posting this because I've never dated someone who had this kind of addiction, so I want guidance to navigate this the best I can for his benefit. I know I can't save him and that all of this is up to him, but I want to be the best support I can. Being part of the NA program, he's working on the steps and says that he shouldn't be in any relationship anyway, so we're taking it easy on that aspect, in a healthy way, I think. I'm not a demanding control freak within relationships so it's really just like being FWB until he gets to the point where he isn't just focused on himself (which is entirely fine with me). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe's been sleeping a LOT the last couple days, and we don't live together, so he hasn't been in contact with me as much as before he decided to get clean. I trust that he's healing and recovering and not actually relapsing. He's got a super supportive roommate/friend that knows his situation and is sensitive to it. He's got a best friend (super great guy) that he spends most of his time with if he's not with me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo if you have any light to shed on this situation that would be good for me to know to continue to support him and his healing, I'm all ears. Anything I should be cautious of? Anything I should bring up or address with him? I appreciate your feedback. :)",

            "selftext": "We\u2019re currently living with his herion addicted sister. She is 8 days free of herion (taking methadone) and is doing very well sticking to it.\n\nShe began to talk about getting herself a job. I work in a bar and she asked if I thought that kind of work would suit her. I told her no, and explained that when she is 100% sober, it would not be a good idea for her to be constantly surrounded by people who are not.\n\nMy partner completely disagreed with me and said that he thought she would love working in a bar. He said that being surrounded by drunk people would not affect her recovery/sobriety.\n\nA larger problem here is that my partner often tells his sister that once she is sober, she will be absolutely fine. He does not respect or agree with my opinion that she will need some kind of therapy (I always encourage her to seek CBT) in order to cope with her emotions.\n\nShe has been through trauma the likes that my partner and I can barely imagine. She has done some heinous things due to her addiction and when she has no herion to help her to avoid these emotions, they will need to be dealt with in a healthy way to avoid relapse or worse.\n\nMy partner is not being responsible by telling his herion addicted sister that she does not need therapy etc.\n\nShe looks up to her brother very much and believes he is the smartest person on the world. If he tells her she doesn\u2019t need therapy, she will believe that.\n\nHow do I make him see sense?\nOr am I perhaps wrong in my opinion?\nAny constructive criticism is welcome.\n\nThank you so much in advance.",

            "selftext": " \n\nThe  effects of alcohol on the body can not only be incredibly damaging to  the addict\u2019s personal health but it can also cause irreversible damage  to the lives of friends and family. Most people don\u2019t even realize they  have a problem until it\u2019s too late. After a while, addicts get quite  good at hiding their problems, which makes identification of addiction  quite tricky for friends and loved ones.\n\nIf  you suspect you are an alcoholic, it\u2019s important that you get help as  soon as possible in order to move forward. Although most tend to avoid  talking about the health consequences of alcoholism, the truth is that  it\u2019s important to understand exactly why alcohol abuse is so damaging to  you both physically and socially.\n\nIf  you spend your free time thinking about drinking or fantasizing about  your next drink, you may be an alcoholic that requires assistance in  order for you to break free. Another major symptom of alcoholism is  craving the substance when it is not available. They may also lie about  their frequency of alcohol use.\n\nFor  some adults, alcoholism can have dramatic social consequences. Addicts  frequently struggle financially and may borrow money from friends or  family to pay for their addiction. This leads to strained and unhealthy  relationships that are both stressful and unhealthy.\n\nAlso,  addicts also find it difficult to keep a job. They show up at work  drunk or simply not show up. Typically, as addiction progresses, the  addict starts becoming more and more reclusive and does not attend  social gatherings. They will withdraw from their friends and become more  and lonelier. Unfortunately, this fuels the addiction\u2019s vicious cycle.\n\nIn addition to social consequences, [alcohol addiction](http://alcoban.in/)  includes dramatic health consequences as well. The effects of alcohol  on health include dehydration, anemia, heart problems, and liver  conditions. In extreme cases, alcoholism can lead to cancer, as well as a  host of other problems.\n\nUnfortunately,  addiction withdrawal symptoms can\u2019t be dealt with unassisted, which is  one reason addicts are reluctant to seek the help they need.\u00a0\n\nIf  you\u2019ve been suffering from alcoholism, you need to realize that you  can\u2019t face this alone. Reach out and get the help you need. There are  options that help you reclaim your life once and for all. Better life is  possible. You can get treatment you deserve and the care you need, but  first you have to take the first step. Trust me, it\u2019ll be worth it.\n\nIn order to get rid of alcohol addiction, [Homeopathic Anti-Addiction Treatments](http://alcoban.in/)\u00a0have shown great results in reducing cravings and making it easier to quit drinking. [**Alcoban**](http://alcoban.in/)\u00a0is one such homeopathic [**AntiAddiction Drop**](http://alcoban.in/)**.**\u00a0It  is made utilizing the benefits of selective homeopathic ingredients  which contain properties that deal with the symptoms of addiction at the  root level and help the addict get rid of their dependence on alcohol  completely. It can be used to quit any type of addiction such as **Alcohol, Cigarettes, Drugs,**\u00a0etc.\u00a0\n\nFor further information, visit [**http://alcoban.in/**](http://alcoban.in/)",

Stints or stretches of recovery, my longest about 2-1/2 years. And now, its gotten to the point where i desperately do want to stay clean, and i cannot for the life of me stay clean very long at all. I hate it. I live in a sober house and could very well be immediately homeless if caught. I have a baby coming in a few months. I know the consequences and yet i cannot manage to stay clean for even about a week. Ive been to rehab, been through a halfway house, and no matter how sure ive been that i am done, i struggle so bad. I feel so weak and inferior. And i see the lives people get when they get clean and stay clean and honestly change, and i dont know how to stifle the craving. I am totally powerless over the hold drugs and alcohol have me in. I owe a few grand to the IRS, a few grand in child support, and do not have the same zeal or motivation or determination to do anything like i did even five years ago it feels like sometimes.\n\nI dont know if its self pity or what you wanna call it but, I dont know what to even do. Even clean for months at a time, i still think about it every day. It still drives me crazy and haunts me every single day. The urge. The urge i have to suppress. No matter how badly it has damaged my life. The poison feels like the only cure. It always takes much more than it ever gives, and yet i cannot help the curse of the craving. I hate it. It makes me sick. And yet i am seemingly powerless to resist it. And with each broken promise that this time will be different, I find myself trusting myself less and less to make good on it.\n\nI know what the solution is. I know it exists. Yet i cannot seem to follow through honestly. Please God if you're out there help me. You're my only hope.",

My problem is I do not have 1 choice or preference of drug, I like everything.\n\nI was introduced to Meth about 6 months ago and what started as a once or twice a week has now been everyday for 4 months. I have been using it to improve my performance at work (the lie Ive been telling myself) I have been microdosing and only taking 1 dose in the morning. Enough to perk me up and keep my energy. It started off amazing and everything seemed to be positive. I was working harder, getting things done and was seemily happy.\n\nNow I am starting to experience the reality of my situation, I am not sleeping most nights and am losing cognitive functuons as well as terrible anxiety and panick attacks.\n\nIt is so fucked up laying in bed everynight begging myself to stop and never touch it again. Of course when im high this sounds all so simple. Then the morning comes and I struggle to wake up, if I stay sober for more than 24 hours I get very irritable and feel fucking empty then I dose again just to straighten myself out.\n\nI need to fucking stop this shit asap, I know this is a stupid question to ask and is different for everyone but with the time period I have been using, how long is it going to take for those symptoms to go away or atleast be tolerable when I stop?  Also should I be stopping cold turkey or slowly work off of it?\n\nAny advice would help tremendously.",

            "selftext": "I am asking because there is no standard definition of a relapse. As someone who is in recovery myself, I am well aware of all the professionally described stages to relapse, including mental, emotional, and physical relapse. However, my own opinion of physical relapse tends to skew away from those used by many others who are I'm recovery, especially those who strongly follow the 12 step programs out there, NA and AA being the prime examples. \n\nWhat if someone with a strong foundation slips up on **one** occasion, say one night of using a drug and then immediately and powerfully pulls themselves back onto the path of recovery? Some, such as myself consider this a mistake but not a true relapse. A true physical relapse to me is a bit more serious than that, and includes a more powerful and harmful experience than a very small, one night lapse of judgement. This is all subjective, but many recovering addicts will argue to the end of time on this matter. That's quite possibly because many addicts are not capable of a very short duration, small quantity use of any substance whatsoever followed by an immediate  continuance down the path of recovery from a robust position of strength. For many addicts any usage of substances at all leads them into what I would consider a true, full blown occurrence of physical relapse from which it may be extremely difficult for them to extricate themselves from.  \n\nI value your opinions on this, since as previously stated there is currently no solidly defined objective definition to meaning of relapse.

He's been an alcoholic for maybe 10 years, but for the last year and a half he's been trying to get sober.\n\nHe goes to detox gets sober, but always ends up relapsing. He is in what I believe to be in a toxic relationship. She enables him and in a few occasions abuses him, but he won't leave her because she is \"his rock\".\n\nHe was on a waiting list to get into a place called \"Fresh Start\" not sure if that's local or a bigger thing. He took his name off claiming he can't afford it. \n\nOver the last 6 months he has began to spiral hard. Yesterday he called me twice saying he was gonna kill himself, I managed to calm him down, and I have talked to him this morning, so I know he's at least alive. \n\nIt sounds like his girlfriend is gonna leave which I think is good, he does not.\n\nI think that's the full story.\n\nI come here to ask what I can do. I've never dealt with any of this before, I don't understand addiction, I have never suffered from it. He is self sabotaging and getting worse everyday. Also for the suicide part I can't really call anybody cause I don't know his address right now.\n\nThank you in advance.",

I have some pyrazolam blotters coming soon so that should be better, also have flubromazolam solution but i cant dose due to no syringe.\n\nIm not addicted to benzos or have any dependence to them. I dont drink, but god, I crave stimulants. \n\nNEP is pretty great tbh but the comedown is awful. last night i was trying to clear my nose since i couldnt breathe through it, but i had to do it without evoking suspicion from my dad, and all of a sudden blood starts flowing out my nose onto the bathroom floor. Im fucked guys. \n\nI need help friends, i dont know if rehab will help. I have a physical illness that makes life extremely depressing and also makes me very suicidal. Pray for a nigga, im trying. God bless\n\nJust look at this post, im a trainwreck. I never would think my life would turn out like this. My dad found plastic, for drugs, on the floor and ive never felt such shame in my life. he wasnt mad, just sad.  \n\n\n\nMy doctor who is a substance abuse specialist found a good hospital for me to do inpatient treatment at. I think it would be good. Hopefully i can come back and handle the anxiety of finishing classes for my certificate for computer networking.\n\nI start University in the fall for biology and seriously dont think i can do it sober. \n\nThe game of life is hard to play I'm gonna lose it anyway The losing card I'll someday lay So this is all I have to say\n\n\nPS: i think im addicted to porn as well",

            "selftext": " \n\nHello to anyone who spends time reading my post. I realized I have an addiction a very long time ago, however, I am so far unable to control it.\n\nThere is a cycle I cannot break from:\n\n1. I see a nice looking statue from my favorite game or show (GoT statue, Witcher, Dragon Ball, Warframe, WoW and so on)\n2. I purchase said statue (pricing varies between $50-$350 which was the most expensive I got + shipping)\n3. Statue spends time on my desk for a while, in a place where I can admire it\n4. Guilt seeps is, and a thought that I spent too much on said statue won't give me peace\n5. Guilt makes me convince myself that I grew bored with said statue, and I am better off selling it to recover my investment\n6. I usually sell the statue at a cheaper price, because there are very few people who'd be willing to pay the same amount I did\n7. Once the statue is sold, I find a new statue that I purchase\n\nI've repeated the circle for over 30 times, and it's making me lose money. I become bored of the item quickly, and want the next one, but guilt and lack of space keep me from collecting more items. I tried having a collection, but seeing all those statues just sitting there, doing nothing, made me realize I could have used my money for something better, like traveling, so I sold them all in the end. I kept telling myself it's a hobby like any other, but it's an expensive hobby, and one that's causing me to lose money on the long run.\n\nI gifted many statues I couldn't sell to my friends, all new or in mint condition. I returned others for the slightest defect, when the real reason was that I was bored of them. I made people buy statues which weren't available in my country and send them to me, only to say a while later \"Hey, I don't want that anymore. Could you please return it and get your money back?\".\n\nI keep lying to myself saying \"Oh, I am just looking for the ONE statue. You know, the one that will always remain with me, that I'll never sell.\" But I always sell them in the end. It also affects my relationship, my girlfriend (although we've been together for a long time) started asking me questions that I might get bored of her as well, and she's scared that she'll suffer the same fate as my statues in the end.\n\nPart of my solution is to look at the statue and remember what made me buy it in the first place and why I like it. Another thing when wanting to buy a new statue is to look at a picture of it long enough until I grow bored and no longer want it, but then I just focus my attention on any new statue I lay my eyes on. I also tell myself that I had so many statues in the past and they all had the same fate, and that surely there will be more statues I will like in the future, but that doesn't mean I'll also keep them, however I still impulsively buy and then regret my decision afterwards.\n\nI have far more important projects to invest money in (like buying a car and a new PC), and it's hurting the relationship I have with my loved ones, so this addiction has to stop. Therefore, any help or advice will be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you!",

ALLOW ME\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Addiction Timeline*\n\n* **October 2011** \\- First time alcohol and cannabis use\n* **October 2011- October 2015** \\- Casual alcohol and cannabis use, no signs of addict behavior\n* **October 2015** \\- Falsely arrested for pot poss., my girlfriend is a fucking alcoholic but damn she has big tits complex, wow college is hard and \"I Dont Know Why I Am Here\" by My Own Voice keeps playing on repeat. BOOM and this transcends into the easily forgettable...\n* **November 2015** \\- Yeah, I do not remember this shit. I wasn't kidding. I literally got high everyday off of cannabis. This is where the pathway for Addiction Dr. was paved. I, for the first time in my life, used to make myself feel better because I did not enjoy my reality. Didn't see this at the time though.\n* **November 2015 - February 2017** \\- Dad passes unexpectedly Feb. '16 from opioid overdose, joined two abusive organizations at University, and I fall on my fucking face emotionally, academically, financially, physically, YEAH everything.. and determine, finally, \"I am a damn addict OP, fuck, I hate my life, you do not want to end up like your dad.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **February 2017**\\- **Present** HOLY FUCKING SHIT. The first step in solving a problem is recognizing you have a problem, yep, I have done that, but, are you ready for this shitstorm? \n\n***Feb' 17*** \\- W'ed from Uni (More of that same song mentioned above on repeat)\n\n***Spring '17*** \\- Bullied by Fraternity, heavily depressed\n\n***Summer '17*** \\- At a hive mind religious org. camp, lose best friend, heavily depressed\n\n***Fall '17*** \\- Living at home, trying to save money to return to Uni, still being bullied by Fraternity, kinda depressed\n\n***Spring '18*** \\- Return to Uni, get the flu and relapse two weeks in, return, make best effort to recover semes., pull a 2.8, fail a class, lose financial aid FUCK, really depressed\n\n***Summer '18*** \\- Which... leads us into the most drug filled three months of my life. Homie smoked pot, did lines, and popped percs for majority of the summer, while simultaneously watching most of my family and friends derail from me or life because of their own ignorance/battles with addiction. \n\n***Fall '18*** Alright. Alright. Take a deep breath. You've been sober for 8 weeks. The semester is starting. You are going to make a great politician... Yep. This guy thought he could be a good, moral, caring dude in politics and  I was rocked by the cultural setting within these two realms at my specific University (member in Student Government and another politically affiliated group). I was a total misfit and fell off the fucking earth. I worked really hard for years to get to that point and it was nothing that i expected it to be. I was DEPRESSED. So one week after winning member of the month within SGA, i said i fucking hate this, and took a dive into deep end of the addiction pool. It was atrocious. People didn't know where I was. I lost like 8 friends because of this disappearance. They were confused, but I knew. I fucking knew, man. I was done. I still am done sometimes. Which leads us to here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Spring '19*** \\- Here we are, smack dab in the middle of Spring. I relapsed on 4/20. I got a good job this spring, but lost that shit because I didn't care anymore, again, and got high for a week straight. *Last week, to be exact.* I have such a rich history of trauma in my life and especially over the last three years. I've done some really incredible things in life. I've been a trailblazer in a lot of ways. However, i have really fucking failed at a lot of other stuff. I have temporarily shot college. I'm struggling to find my way with others and I am just do damn cynical at times. I'm struggling to find the love, but I know its there.  I can't fucking sober on my own anymore on my own friends. I am about to tear up writing this sentence, fuck, one literally just dropped. I am so damn tired. Ive got loans to pay. I still have dreams to chase. I still have a family I want to love and be there for. I have a great therapist, I have a home right now, but I just lost this job to a relapse, and like I said, I'm tired. ANY love helps, guys. Any support. I want to stay sober, but I'm struggling to find that push tonight.",

Anyway if anyone is interested in a strange way to spend a Friday morning the show opens at 10:00am and closes at 3:00pm on May 17th, at 4201 South Congress Ave #202 Austin Tx.

            "selftext": "I don\u2019t know anyone who has been through this so I\u2019ve set up a Reddit account to ask for some advice... \n\nTo give you some back story - I\u2019ve been dating \u201cBob\u201d for 1.5 years, I\u2019m 27 and he is 36. I\u2019ve been in other serious relationships for longer so I mean it when I say I think he is the one.. He has spoke about marrying me, flew me to his family\u2019s house for Xmas, so we are pretty serious, not yet living together. \n\nHe also has a very important job in the film industry which has its own circle of drug use.. So he is high functioning for sure, his career is going so well. \n\nHe has history of addiction in his family and dealing. He was a dealer (large amounts and heavy stuff) early into our relationship and I had no idea how deep it was at the time. This came out 2 weeks ago. I knew he was doing something but had no idea it was that deep. \n\nHe has underplayed his drug use prior to knowing me, I know this because he has tripped himself up when telling stories. \nHe has spoke of using crack, meth and H to mention a few but that\u2019s back story... \n\n\nTo sum up what I\u2019m trying to say is I know SOME things... but I\u2019m aware I don\u2019t know everything. \n\nSo my main thing is that I know he is using something semi frequently and he is trying to hide it from me. I know because randomly some days his pupils are crazy dilated, his speech is getting mixed up, he shakes and his voice is different. Other times he is sweating and his mouth seems dry and his temperature will be high. When he is this way he also won\u2019t sleep all night and he has no appetite... \nAt these times the only way I can describe him is \u201che seems as if he is trying to appear normal\u201d.  It is usually at the weekend or when he is off work. This could be 3 consistent weekends in a row or once a month or not for months. It\u2019s as erratic as him.\n\nSo I don\u2019t know what to do.... I have asked him many times if he has been high etc and it\u2019s now at the point where if I mention anything like that we just end up fighting about it! I don\u2019t know how to make him feel not attacked - trust me I have gone about this in the upmost nicest of ways... \n\nI love this man with all my heart and I want the best for him. If he is using something it\u2019s going to harm him and I don\u2019t want that. I don\u2019t want him to overdose, I\u2019m afraid. This stuff is not in my normal works. \n\nI want to talk to him about it but I don\u2019t know how anymore... I want to help him but in order for me to do that he needs to want to help himself. \n\nPart of thinks I\u2019m being paranoid and he will tell me I\u2019m tripping but with the things I see as I mentioned above it\u2019s pretty obvious \u2639\ufe0f \n\nI also think he is afraid to tell me because I\u2019m not like him in that way and I don\u2019t use...\nI just really don\u2019t know what to do... \n\nAny ideas what it could be that he is taking? \nWhat should I watch out for? \nHow can I approach this conversation with him? \nHow can I help him? \nAm I just trippin? \nI have millions of questions \ud83d\ude1e",

            "selftext": "I know it\u2019s \u201cjust weed\u201d and everything and my addiction may not be quite like some others.  \n\nBut I\u2019ve smoked for 10 years, everyday, with the exception of a handful of days.  It doesn\u2019t really do anything for me anymore.  I only do it so I can fall asleep at night and it\u2019s kind of habit.  I really don\u2019t even like being high that much anymore.  It\u2019s alright but I\u2019m 27 and it\u2019s time to move on.  I have never even felt what it\u2019s like to be an adult and not smoke weed since I started when I was 17.  It hasn\u2019t affected my life negatively besides maybe a little anxiety from time to time.  I finished college, have a good job, make good money, have friends and good relationships... it\u2019s just time.  I\u2019ve thought about it for awhile now and just need to do it. \n\nIn addition to extreme trouble sleeping, I have crazy insane nightmares that are more vivid than any dreams I have ever had.  I don\u2019t know what this is about.  For those 2 reasons, I haven\u2019t quit yet because I don\u2019t really have a good solution to those issues.  I work M-F from 8-5 and the trouble sleeping is going to definitely affect my work/motivation.  \n\nIs this normal?  Anyone have any tips?  How long does this last?  Any advice or help would be amazing.  I think a lot of it could be in my head.  I quit cigarettes 5 years ago cold turkey after college and it was one of the easiest things ever.  For some reason this seems harder and the side effects from quitting seem worse.  I had almost no side effects from cigarettes.",

            "selftext": "Last night I was drunk and arrested with a weapon. I have a girlfriend and we have a very volatile relationship. Ontop of that, ive always been a weed addict and an alcoholic for the last 2 years. Ive also been addicted to self harm before. \n\nI went to rehab and left this girl, because after meeting her I lost my ex partner and started a cocaine addiction as well. \n\nDuring each cocaine rampage I was awake 5  or so days. After rehab I relapsedand was awake 7 days, fucked up, ruined everything, then relapsed againa  3 rd time. I shouldve died the 2nd and 3rd time but didnt. \n\nNow Ive just been trying to get detox medication for the alcohol withdrawls. Every time I try to stop I get such bad withdrawls I end up in hospital.\n\nI told my girlfriend that I need 2 weeks to relax whilst I get these meds and that I may get slightly drunk and unstable as I have been, yet she accused me of stealing 2 pounds.. She  literally said 2 days ago that she was going to move in here and have a family with me, and then YESTERDAY  I used 2 quid of hers and said id give it back, was agreed, but then she forgot, and it was the last straw for me and I was drunk. She was threatening to leave over 2 quid, I couldnt wrap my head around it.\n\nI was so drunk and irrational that I was worse than her. I  went and swallowed around 12 or so paracetomals, i thought it would make me pass out or die, but I dont know why I did that. In that moment I didnt care about my mum, my dad, my dog, anything, I was just selfishly and patheticly trying to prove to her that I loved her that much I was willing to die for it. Over 2 pound.\n\nI went straight to the hospital, and she took her stuff and left. I then ran away from the hosptial and went to her house to try and apologise, and she wouldnt even speak to me. Then she blocked me on face book and blocked my number.\n\nMy dad called me at 12am and said that hed called the police, as my mum had been calling him about it all, and because I had clearly tried to commit suicide, I had also cut my self again! I hadnt done it for so long, and I did it really badly quite a few times. I needed stitches in the end. \n\nMy dad tried to plead with me, why dont I care about my whole family ect, but I was drunk out of my mind, I didnt care, I didnt mean to do it. Ive been begging doctors for detox meds and ive been begging the NHS and raid teams to lock me away as Im a danger to my self, but they wont. \n\nI said one final thing to my dad, let me come live with you, take me away, and that will stop me, and he said no chance in hell, so I hung up and went down to the big park, before the police came.\n\nI slept in the bushes for a little while and threw away my phone. I took my fishing knife just incase as ut was late and im a paranoid person.\n\nAfter about half hour I started hearing noises ect, so I came back home. As I got in the police were standing there talking to my mum, and I had my fishing knife in my pocket. It was a straight arrest.\n\nI then spent until 3 am at the hospital getting checked out and stitched up, and actually wathing GoT with the police officer, which was really comforting, and then was taken to the station and left in a cell until 3 pm the following day. Today.\n\nThe nurse at the police stationm told me I have to wait now and continue drinking until I get detox meds through Spectrum (NHS). I said this to my dad when he picked me up, given that im broke and jobless and cant afford alcohol, and he didnt believe it. He made me call spectrum and he questioned them and interrogated them, he said to them \"my son tries to kill himself when he gets drunk, but your saying If he doesnt get drunk then he will likely die?\". They tiold him yes Ill almost definately have a alcohol related seizure and probably die with the amount I drink.\n\nHe asked if there was any other way and they said its up to him to drink as little as he needs to get through, but even I know, after all this time and all these relapses, I cant just drink a little, I cant, I need to just stop, and I want to. I actually referred myself for these meds 2 weeks ago now and ive been chasing it every second day as I get sicker and sicker from drinking alone.\n\nAnyway, now Im home, I was sober earlier, and shaking and sweating and convulsing, but ive had a few beers now and feel quite tipsy, and not sick anymore, but naturally now Im just worried. I still dont know what the fuck im doing. Ive told the raid team muiltiple teams that if you let me go Im probably going to end up killing mjyself through drugs and alcohol, and I keep doing it. I feel like ive been let down, and I just dont quite have the courage to section myself. \n\nI also know that the reason they wont section me is because when Im sober Im not crazy, so its just a waiting game. But at this point its also a ticking clock for me clearly. I almost got sent to prison last night for 2 years over 2 pound, why would I let myself be so irrational, I dont even understand. Ontop of that I almost and actually tried to die. I dont understand why I do these things when Im drunk and I just want to drop drinking but every doctor and nurse is telling me I cant. I need to wait atleast another whole week of this, and its getting worse and worse, and im worried.",

            "selftext": "Back when I was in school we would sometimes watch videos on drug addiction in Health class.  The addicts would talk about how drugs ruined their lives like they would get fired or end up in jail, and it didn't seem to make sense.  All drugs do, I wondered, is give you pleasure yet people continue to use them despite all those problems.\n\nNow that I'm older and I have struggled with addiction I understand better.  First there's peer pressure or you're friends with other people who do drugs.  You want to be accepted into the group and not too many loners would pass up on having friends.  That's usually how things start, but even when things start going wrong addicts continue to use them.\n\nThere's a willful ignorance of the problems being caused by the drugs.  Like maybe you did them too late at night so you'll do them earlier.  Or you did too many at once so you'll just do less from now on.  Or whatever happened you'll just do something different but keep using.\n\nThen there's the loss of control.  Maybe you tried to stop a few times but due to the torment you caved.  Then after a while you know the torment is coming so you give up preemptively.  And maybe there's an extenuating circumstance however once you make enough or those in a row the new amount becomes the new normal.\n\nHowever at the end of the day addictions still don't make sense.  The pleasure becomes idealized however it's not really all that good.  And the torment of quitting would go away if you didn't keep starting and stopping over and over again.  And it completely takes over your psyche while simultaneously ruining your life.  No high is worth all that.",

Under your present circumstances, it\u2019s not worth it to keep going; it\u2019s not fun anymore. \n\nSo, what time is it?\n\nIt\u2019s RECOVERY TIME!\n\n- \u201cI have a problem.\u201d\n- \u201cI have a brain disease.\u201d\n- \u201cI\u2019m going to Meetings.\u201d\n- \u201cI\u2019ll go to rehab for treatment:\u201d\n\nWhat happens after you do these things?\n\n- You re-stabilize your life\n- You repair relationships \n- Your health improves\n- You earn back money\n\nNow, you\u2019re back in a position where you can enjoy doing drugs again.

For the past three years I went from weed to alcohol to coke to meth. I miss the innocent girl who laughed in the face of drugs. I always dabbled in taking pills as a teen but it came to the point where I would be puking from drinking or staying up with coke and now I stay up for days on meth. It\u2019s so scary. I don\u2019t know who I am anymore. My boyfriend is 2 years addict but wants to quit meth too. We\u2019re just so lost. And seem to be stuck in a cycle of coming down.

I do notice though that a consistant thing is I'm always struggling with it : finding the number for my dealer, getting money, actually doing the coke (it keeps falling off the table or shit like that). And last night, I had a dream that I was in a super difficult situation and I cracked and called my dealer, but at the end of the dream I called him again to cancel it and told him he souldn't come !!!! I think it's an improvement. But still I woke up drenched in sweat and exhausted. \n\nI think maybe now that my body has gotten rid of the drugs, my mind is also detoxing ?   \nAnyway, I'm hanging on. Those dreams also remind me of the shame I would feel if I gave up now and called my dealer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhave a beautiful day !",

            "selftext": "So, I'm balls deep in PAWS right now. I know this so I'm dealing with it. Lucky me happens to have a diagnosis of anxiety to go along with a host of mental health issues aside from my addiction. Today, I went to the dentist to check out some dental work I had done. On my way back home, hubs and I stopped at a fast food joint for some food for him. I got a vanilla ice cream cone. So, I'm hungry. Soft diets suck. Add to that, I'm tired. So I'm halfway to HALT. I took my anxiety meds before the appointment because I knew I'd have to drop into my old stomping grounds for the appointment. So, I go pee. Side bar: My DOC is IV meth. So, I'm sitting on the toilet, finishing my yellow waterfall when I happen to look down. Lo and Behold, I spy a very large shard on the ground. I take a deep breath, wipe, and get the fuck out of Dodge.(Yes, I washed my hands.) I headed straight to my car and devoured my ice cream cone like it was my last meal. Once we were on the road back home, I told my husband about it. It was definitely a close call. I'm pretty proud of myself. I honestly think that taking that preemptive strike by taking my meds and being very aware of where I'm at in my recovery seriously helped me get through that situation. PS. I have about 6 weeks of recovery. The moral of the story is educate yourself. Understanding what is happening in your brain goes a long way toward controlling your responses to big triggers. I'm pretty damn grateful for those 10 stints in rehab right now.",

I always feel like crap every time I do that. It has been difficult for me to just get past one day without eating any processed foods and sweets but the fact the I went 13 days without was great I have never been able to do that before. Now I'm back at day one again. Its been almost 4 months since I have had coffee and I have no plans to go back to it, I'm a coffee addict and would sometimes drink 8 to 10 cups of coffee a day from the morning to the am. I would always try to make the coffee as strong as possible and to extend its duration. I had previously went 5 months without coffee since I almost had a heart attack but I had relapse and almost had another heart attack this past Christmas.",

I was on auto-pilot and it almost destroyed me.\n\nThis last relapse was a doozy, and was really truly almost literally my last.\n\n2 days later I let it all go. The lifestyle, the so-called 'friends' the majority of all self-destructive substances and behaviors. \n\nand I have 6 months and 6 days clean to show for it. I got to celebrate my two sons birthdays recently and I thank my lucky stars for this chance.\n\nof course people from my past try to get me down, even going so far as to throw it in my face and send hateful messages telling me to kill myself and calling me a junkie. the same people that 6 months ago were fine to sell to me or do my drugs..  but since I've ceased contact they've taken it upon themselves to whisper bullshit about me. \nI have no interest or intention to set them straight. \n\nIn the past when I would get clean, I would use the geographical cure, and move as far away from it all to start fresh. But because the problem laid within me, it follows. \n\nThis is the first time I've had to stay put and face it to such an extent.  and I mean literally face. these people are my neighbors, my community (or lack there of)\n\nI can't look out my kitchen window or step out my door without seeing a deal go down or these people.\n\nI tell myself this is a real testament to my strength because 6 months 6 days people! this is a huge achievement for me. so let them hate. they are just miserable excuses for people, living their crappy little lives, never going anywhere, never striving to be better.\n\nBut me?

            "selftext": "Being young and anxious, i loved xanax the first time i took it 2years ago. After dropping out of the last year of high school to go to rehab I finally managed to lower benzos to zero. It was a hard battle, anxiety, memory loss,depression, and a lot o withdrawals. I\u2019ve lost my friends, only girlfriend and changed countries in the process, but now I\u2019m feeling good every day, my memory came back, my cognitive skills again, minor to no anxiety, first time I\u2019ve been social without xanax. I can confirm THAT THINGS GET BETTER EVEN WHEN ALL HOPE IS LOST, I got my life back and i hope i can inspire others to do the same.",

We don\u2019t fight a lot there has maybe been three times we\u2019ve yelled at each other in the almost two years we\u2019ve been together. I just feel like no points are getting across if I lightly suggest it should I say something and try to go easy on him and just suggest we don\u2019t drink tonight. But I feel like I need to be blunt and say we cannot drink tonight I don\u2019t want you too. I\u2019ve told him many times that we need to stop drinking . I\u2019m getting frustrated being in the never ending drinking cycle. It is obviously my fault I am drinking but I don\u2019t know what to do I don\u2019t want to be rude but it seems like we\u2019re not getting anywhere in our tries to stop drinking and it scares me.",

            "selftext": "Hi guys. Just need some feedback. My mother is one of the nicest most generous people I have ever met. She always looks for the good in people  no matter what. My mom has struggled with addiction for many years. Used to be prescription pills. She has bad knees and has been on methadone for a couple years as a non addictive alternative to what she was getting from her doctor. I\u2019m happy she is trying but have my doubts about the effectiveness of methadone. She would regularly sleep for extended periods of time and stay in her room all day some time. I asked her many times if she was taking anything other than her medication. She always said no. Last year things took a turn for the worst and I found Evidence she was into hard drugs. She would not tell me what but I found several glass tube pipes with metal in the end for a filter. I finally confronted her about it she denied it until I had presented all my evidence. I had found. We had a great talk and she assured me she would stop. I told her how I would check if she was breathing when she slept. I was always afraid she would overdose and I would find her lifeless. I believe she has stopped with the bullshit (drugs). Few months later and I have trouble believing anything she tells me. I told her it\u2019s hard to believe her after she lied to my face for so long. How do I trust her again? I feel like an asshole for questioning her but history has made me doubt her. What do you think? If it was a friend that had been lying to me the whole time I would delete them from my life. But it\u2019s my mom. I can not/will not abandon her. Thanks",

                    "selftext": "Hello, reddit,\n\nI am a highly functional degenerate addicted to Adderall, Xanax, kratom, and alcohol. I maintain a prestigious job at a law firm that pays greater than a $200,000 salary yearly. I have a wife and kids that I love dearly. In other words, I have everything to lose. Despite that fact, I find myself in a vicious and repetitive cycle of consistent binges on these substances. I'm terrified of the damage that I'm doing to my body and brain. I cry at times of the thought of my children growing up without their father. Despite all of this, I have been on a downward spiral for at least the last 3+ years with these substances.\n\nIt is not uncommon for me to consume more than 100 mgs of Adderall, 20 grams of kratom, 2 mgs of Xanax, and 8 beers in a 24 hour period. This has become a daily routine. Despite my substance abuse, I'm actually pretty fucking good at what I do. I'm consistently getting promotions/raises and reaching great accomplishments in my field. These substances allow me to focus on my work for ridiculously long periods of time and enjoy every second of it, despite the mundane nature of the work.\n\nI haven't always been a piece of shit. For the majority of my life, I was an extremely healthy and mentally disciplined individual. I religiously worked out at least five times a week and followed a strict diet to the point of orthorexia. I was extremely optimistic and consistently read self-help books. While I had dabbled with drugs and alcohol in my younger years, I never once became addicted or physically dependent to any substance. In fact, I avoided most substances for about 3 years before my addiction in an attempt to achieve optimal health (whatever the fuck that means).\n\nWhile I was in law school, I had a routine doctor's appointment. I'm not sure how the conversation unfolded, but at some point, my doctor said something to the effect of \"I'm surprised you're not asking for Adderall yet.\" I followed up with, \"Can you do that?\" Ultimately, my doctor prescribed me Adderall XR 30 mgs per day. This was the beginning of my downward spiral.\n\nAt first, I used the Adderall about twice a week for days when I had both class and work. Two days a week became three days and so on and so forth. Eventually, I developed a daily requirement for at least one 30 mg Adderall XR. Because I had a doctor's prescription, I rationalized this habit. Daily ingestion of this amount of amphetamine came with unpleasant side effects, particularly insomnia and irritability. The side effects were so unpleasant that I was I was willing to do just about anything to mitigate them. The irritability/insomnia of the comedown ultimately led to an inexcusable reliance on alcohol. This reliance was later supplemented by Xanax and kratom.\n\nMy wife is aware of my addiction (to some extent). She seems to resent me for it, and I can't blame her. I'm a piece of shit on these substances. I am not the same person that I was before I became an addict. My neurological reward system has been compromised. I no longer exercise or receive any pleasure out of eating a healthy meal. In fact, I no longer find pleasure in anything other than consuming my substances and completing work. I find that I'm no longer a nice or kind person. Instead, I'm an unwarranted arrogant asshole who is constantly negative.\n\nI do want to clarify that I am not blaming anyone or anything for my addiction. My addiction is a direct result of my own choices and actions. The last thing I want is sympathy. What I do want is advice on how to get through this. I have made several attempts (without assistance) at sobriety to no avail. Unfortunately, my 60 hour week work schedule is not the most conducive to making the necessary change. Taking a week or two off of work for rehab is not financially practicable for my family.\n\nIf anyone has ever been through anything similar to this (or worse), please give me some practical advice on how to get my life back. If I don't make any drastic changes soon, I'm afraid that I will be permanently compromised, or my kids will will grow up without their father.",

This reliance was later supplemented by Xanax and kratom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My wife is aware of my addiction (to some extent). She seems to resent me for it, and I can&amp;#39;t blame her. I&amp;#39;m a piece of shit on these substances. I am not the same person that I was before I became an addict. My neurological reward system has been compromised. I no longer exercise or receive any pleasure out of eating a healthy meal. In fact, I no longer find pleasure in anything other than consuming my substances and completing work. I find that I&amp;#39;m no longer a nice or kind person. Instead, I&amp;#39;m an unwarranted arrogant asshole who is constantly negative.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do want to clarify that I am not blaming anyone or anything for my addiction. My addiction is a direct result of my own choices and actions. The last thing I want is sympathy. What I do want is advice on how to get through this. I have made several attempts (without assistance) at sobriety to no avail. Unfortunately, my 60 hour week work schedule is not the most conducive to making the necessary change. Taking a week or two off of work for rehab is not financially practicable for my family.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If anyone has ever been through anything similar to this (or worse), please give me some practical advice on how to get my life back. If I don&amp;#39;t make any drastic changes soon, I&amp;#39;m afraid that I will be permanently compromised, or my kids will will grow up without their father.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I also believe it is important to continuously be improving yourself and your attitude but that's what most normal , content people do.  I do believe I'm an addict but I can't believe that there is only one solution, it seems wrong for how complex the illness is.  Obviously if you follow the program you'll stay sober, the program says don't pick up.  I do enjoy a couple meetings I go to but I don't want my life to be engrossed by support groups.

He was caught buying from an undercover cop/someone working with the police (I don\u2019t know how those things work, so excuse my ignorance) and his life, and ours, spiraled. \nUp to this point, he was smoking weed like crazy and stealing my mother\u2019s narcotics. Once he got busted, the police raided our house and found my brother to be in possession of a bunch of weed, heroin, and an old bottle of Percocet that he had stolen from my mom. He refused to admit to stealing the pills and as such, my mom was given a felony conviction for \u201csharing\u201d her narcotics... to this day, my brother refuses to admit that he stole the pills. So, now not only has he ruined his life, but he ruined my mother\u2019s. She who was once a successful accountant is now a convicted felon who has gone bankrupt thanks to her son, who has stolen all of her money and all items of any worth. He even stole my grandmother\u2019s wedding ring, right off her finger while she was sleeping in her nursing home....\nHe\u2019s been off of heroin and narcotics for two years now, but he\u2019s never grown up. He can\u2019t hold a job for longer than 6 months because of his temper. He\u2019s almost 30 and has nothing to show for himself. Not a dollar in savings. Nothing.\nI was robbed of a childhood because of his selfishness. I watched the version of my mom that I knew and love disappear right in front of my eyes. I watched my parents\u2019 marriage nearly end because of him (so thankful that was salvaged- they need each other.) But I can\u2019t stop caring. I worry every day about him. It eats me alive. I want to stop caring but I can\u2019t. I want to stop letting him hurt me. I want to move on with my life.",

Basically, the doctor gave my wife 2x A4 sheets of paper listing the injuries. I was lucky to be alive and according to the doctors \u201ca miracle\u201d I had survived.\n\nWhen I was in hospital I was on heavy painkillers and naturally when I left the hospital they gave me copious amounts of OxyContin which I grew dependant on.\n\nI have some very distinct memories of when I was on Oxy looking at my little daughter playing with toys and just generally being a happy kid. I would play with her for hours with lego and take her to the park to play on the swing. Those memories are etched into my mind forever as some of the greatest moments in my life. In a way I feel that oxy had made my relationship with my daughter the best it could ever be. We grew together and formed the best father/daughter relationship any father could ever wish for.\n\nFast forward 6 months and my marriage was at a breakdown due to my addiction. I decided to kick the addiction and it was a really painful process mentally and physically. One of the hardest things I\u2019ve ever had to do. I remember my dad taking me out for breakfast to help me cope and me dripping in sweat and then feeling really cold at the same time whilst shaking in anxiety and anger that there wasn\u2019t a salt shaker on our table. Thinking to myself, if I get through this, I\u2019m never going down this path again.\n\nIt\u2019s been over 2 years since my accident now and I still can\u2019t fill that \u201cvoid\u201d that the oxy filled. I have tried to do so many different things to try and distract me, but can\u2019t. There\u2019s not a day in my life that I don\u2019t think about oxy. There has been a handful of times that I\u2019ve slipped up since then and maybe that was wrong.\n\nHow do I fill this void? I\u2019ve never managed to get that euphoric feeling back, and I don\u2019t think I ever will. No matter what I do, I can\u2019t get it back.\n\nPlease help :( I am at the point of just saying \u201cfuck it\u201d and going down the rabbit hole of no return.",

Simply telling people that these things are bad and not to do them does nothing but create duplicative and secretive behaviors that enable users to continue to use without intervention from those sincerely looking to help. Whether or not parents like it, if a kid is going to vape, they will despite an advertisement blowing an obnoxious horn at them. Instead of ignorantly pretending like we can control what kids do, we should encourage youngsters to come forward about their vaping experiences WITHOUT REPROCUSSIONS. Because vaping ISNT the problem. Nicotine addiction is, and the sooner we can get our teens the help they need, the better.",

I need ten years of pain. I need to be so dishonest that I can no longer tell the true from the false. I need to hate my life everyday. I need to pray that I do enough to just kill me. I need to dread the next day because I know tomorrow I'll be forced to do it all over again. I need to be degraded, and embarrassed. I need to steal, lie, cheat and cause innocent people pain. I need my son to not know if I'm dead or alive, because I never call and I never see him. I need to spend everyday worrying about being dope sick and how to get my next fix and hit and forget about what real life is like. I need a decade worth of getting my family's hopes up just to tear them down. I need 3,650 days of being a stranger to my loved ones and an embarrassment to my real friends. I need the thought in my head that one bad bag will kill me. I need 5 failed treatment attempts. I need homelessness, and isolation. I need life threatening heart damage from years of drug use. I need to spend my life on the run. I need to spend holidays year after year alone or in jail. I need 5 different back to back stays in jail, 3 overdoses, about 10 emergency room trips, 2 long term hospital stays, I need to be in a coma for almost month and then I need to be on life support for almost 2 months only to walk right out and get high again. I need the stigma of addiction to make me settle in life. I need to be filled with fear in every fiber of my being. I NEED TO LOSE EVERYTHING AND HAVE NOTHING OR NO ONE. Because all that should make me want to change, right?? Black pauses for a second and says, \"Yeah baby girl I got that for you, it's gonna be 80 a bundle today but it's some fire, oh yea and I got that hard ball for you too\", \" also if you feel like lookin out for me I'll look out for you too Ma, my ol ladys at work til 5\" I try to tell him I don't want it and don't wanna do it, and after all that goes through my head, all that comes out of my mouth is, \"I'm on the way.\"\n\n** My 34 year old aunt wrote this and posted it on her Facebook this morning - everything she says happened happened and she's been clean and sober for over a year now. It moved me and shocked me and I just thought I'd share it here... If this girl can do it, I promise you anyone can! I know you've all heard it before but we thought she was going to die and to be frank she probably should be dead. I honestly didn't know she could write something like this, I've even checked it on a couple of plagiarism sites and couldn't find anything.",

I know I need to tell him since he has access to a lot of my banking info and will probably find out soon, I just can't.\n\nOne reason I was able to stay off of it for so long was that I joined my school's football team so I could keep my mind off of it. I quit that and have had a lot of free time which I sometimes spend gambling.\n\nAnother reason I could stay off of it was because I went off of my ADHD medicine over the summer. I started to take it again and that's when I started to get the urge for some reason.\n\nI'm at a loss right now. I'm not too worried about going broke since my parents are supporting me through college (which I'm very thankful for and know isn't the case for a lot of people). I currently have $5 in my personal bank account but I have an internship this summer where I'm going to be making more money than I ever have before. I know this is something I need to crackdown on as soon as possible.\n\nI think I know what I need to do I'm just too afraid (/lazy maybe?) to do it.",

            "selftext": " \n\nFebruary 2nd, 2015\n\nIt was cool. The breeze buffetted against my dry, pallid skin as we  took the all too familiar drive to that initially terrifying  neighbourhood in Fort Worth. The skies were clear, and suprisingly so  was my mental state. Detoxed and checked out of rehab, freed from the  shackles of heroin addiction and withdrawal I sped down that highway,  eager to chain myself once again. The 1987 Toyota Camry rattled,  sputtered, but still pushed on through to where we needed to go. We sat,  waiting impatiently but ever servile to the casual whims of our fickle  dealer. Sitting, waiting, after an hour of sweat, dry heaving, cursing,  and sneezing from the two withdrawing friends who were with me, he  finally sauntered over to us.\n\n\u201cHeyyyyy budday, how was rehab?\u201d He asked, jovially.\n\n\u201cFuck that shit, man\u201d I said, eagerly giving him the money as to not let my friends suffer any more than necessary.\n\n\u201cBe careful with this, man. You know R\\*\\*\\* OD\u2019d when he left rehab a  few months back, I don\u2019t want that to happen to you.\u201d He said with a  degree of seriousness I had never seen from him.\n\n\u201cYeah yeah man I know I\u2019m not going to fuck up\u201d Just words. I wanted to get high.\n\n\u201cPromise me\u201d\n\nProduct divided we rushed to the nearby parking lot. D\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* went  inside to the bathroom, wary of our chosen spot he decided to use inside  the grocery store. M\\*\\*\\* and I, who had been in a \u2018misery loves company\u2019  relationship that only fueled our mutual self-destruction stayed in the  car, we wasted no time. Those veins I had obsessed over and stared at  during my stay in rehab, quietly mapping the first one I would use now  that my arms had somewhat healed made it easy to do quickly. M\\*\\*\\* was  having trouble finding hers due to the speed with which as soon as a  vein was found, it was unceremoniously pummeled into submission until it  was no longer usable. She strained, as I floated off.\n\nThe freight train hum of IV cocaine, a sound caused by the sudden  rush of blood to the brain along with an instant high was quickly  followed by a much heavier than usual comedown brought on by the heroin.  The experience, for me, lasted 10 seconds and just as I was mumbling  something about \u201c\u2026arm is already\u2026 itchy\u201d and died. As my mumbled turned  to a murmur, my consciousness closed around me from the outside and the  ring of black squeezed in from my peripheral vision until I was met with  complete darkness.\n\nM\\*\\*\\* was used to this, I never cared much for limits and there were  plenty of times where I had passed out and nothing ever happened \u2013 plus  she was too concerned with getting her own high to notice. D\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*  returned to see me, lips blue and no longer breathing. This was before  Narcan, before fentanyl, before people knew what to do with someone  overdosing other than rumors and urban legends. He laid the seat back  and M\\*\\*\\* began giving me chest compressions and breath while he drove,  panicking, to the nearest hospital. The same one where R\\*\\*\\* had been  left for dead on the front steps.\n\nI woke up with a head-splitting migraine and the faces of two people  who had actually seen a ghost and saw someone come back to life.\n\nLike the ghost I am, I\u2019ve been haunted by this. I was given a gift, a  second chance at life and an opportunity to do better. Doing drugs was  never the same for me, it tore me apart inside to waste the potential  for a new life I had been given.\n\n\u2018Potential\u2019\n\nI can\u2019t tell you how much resentment I\u2019ve had for this word in the  past. Ever since I was a young boy, constantly those around me would  tell me how much \u2018potential\u2019 I had, and as much as it is a compliment it  is also a deep cut to the soul \u2013 because I never really lived up to it,  and being constantly reminded of that didn\u2019t make anything pleasant  about what I was doing. I wanted to be left alone, to kill myself and to  not have people constantly reminding me that I could be more than I  was. There\u2019s a certain point in my recovery where I had a realization of  that potential, and as easy as it is to look back now and coldly  analyze how wrong I was about that potential, it doesn\u2019t make my  purposeful ignorance of it any less real.\n\nPotential has new meaning for me, no longer is it who I could be but  it is what I can do. My comfort zone is constantly expanding and no  longer am I wasting these gifted days. Every day there is potential for  me to make a difference in my own life or in someone else\u2019s. People  don\u2019t understand why I take life so seriously now, but this is why.  Because by any stretch of the imagination I\u2019m lucky to have it at all,  and if I don\u2019t squeeze every bit of passion into every unearned day I  would be doing the universe a disservice.\n\nI no longer run to what gives me comfort from things in my life that  don\u2019t go according to plan. I wait for those best-laid plans of mice and  men to go awry because the biggest gift I can receive is an opportunity  to see how much I can really handle. When other people run from  unexpected problems, I run towards them \u2013 just for the thrill of the  challenge.\n\nI\u2019m a hammer, life\u2019s a nail.",

I'm feeling a lot better but I've noticed myself in times of withdrawals I become someone that I don't recognize. Does anyone else experience something like this? \n\nLet me explain, I feel like all my sexual urges come in waves in relation to stress, depression, boredom, etc. When I get into one of these waves, it's like the metaphorical devil on my shoulder becomes me and takes over, I start acting irrationally, acting out angrily, I say stuff I don't mean, I lead people on just to get sex, I manipulate and coerce others into submission of my wants. I hate when I realize what I became because of my addiction and rough withdrawals.\n\nWhen I finally get off or wake up in the morning with someone I vaguely know I realize my mistake and feel terribly for it I feel like I have no control over my body sometimes. I know I need to remove any kind of sexual stigma like porn or tinder, but how do I deal with my alternate side of me in the moment? Is there a way to help bring me back down to earth? \n\nDoes anyone else feel this way? Thanks!",

            "selftext": "I was a very lonely and bullied kid, overprotected, overcharged, physically abused by my mom. When it comes to regular \"girl stuff\", like makeup, parties and kissing boys, I flourished a little too late in comparison to my classmates. At thirteen, I was still into stuff most people at my age didn't like anymore. So I found out that there were people on social media creating new characters based on existing cartoons, books and TV shows, writing their own stories together. I'd spend my entire free time on the internet engaging with these people because I couldn't relate with anyone in the outside world. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRole playing has been present in 70% of my teenage/adult life. I've had some consistent hiatus time, like in my senior year in school and through my most social time on college. Now, as an adult, I have a steady life, a job I love at a city I love and everything is on track. I'm doing better than my bullies. But still, I'm addicted. I feel like hiding most of the details from everyone else IRL because it doesn't feel healthy. It just seems like I'm escaping from my own life and creating new ones because what I have is not enough. There is no apparent need for me to turn to such a strong form of escapism at this point in my life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI engage mostly to real-life stories. They're just more heartwarming, quirky and comedic than real life. Sometimes there's some action involved. I haven't been involved on online sex, which is a big part of the community activities nowadays. To be honest, the online sex was always the part that bored me the most. This is something that I always stress on my profiles, especially now that I'm on a monogamous healthy relationship where I am 100% free to explore my fantasies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can see a really consistent pattern, similar to dependence. I always turn to online roleplaying whenever I feel bad, but what is supposed to be a healthy hobby turns out to be something that bummers me, makes me depressed and steals my time, and even though, I want to come back and check my notifications, I want to see if someone missed me or sent me a message. And whenever I'm away and watch a movie or a show that really drags my attention, my first though is \"well, I definitely could roleplay this\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think I'm just really attached to the idea of creating something new and captivating. Someone with a great personality but big flaws and challenges. The whole process of choosing a faceclaim (someone famous to be the \"actor\" to play that character), studying a cultural background to apply to them... I love the idea of living somewhere else, in another time. But soon it goes into a spiral of disappointment because I don't really connect with the other players anymore. I always notice that the older people with the same interests as mine have left and went to live their lives and only the younger ones, with interests and behavior I don't relate to, are still there, and the community is way too toxic, shady and negative nowadays. That makes me deeply sad, angry, anxious and guilty. And, although I know this is gonna happen, I keep waiting for something magical to unfold. And I tried to write fiction, but it's really not the same. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe game numbs me to everything. It's like I'm always on hold and all my real life achievements and tasks are happening on autopilot and I can't really taste it. I always, \\*always\\* develop a stronger sense of gratitude, lucidity and privilege recognition whenever I'm away from it. But then I miss the thrill of creating something and I always come back, just to feel bad, stay away for a while, then come back and ruin all my productivity and attention again. I booked my first therapist appointment to see how it goes, but I'm pretty skeptical about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(TL;DR: I've been role-playing for a long time, and I feel like it's bumming me out, ruining my productivity and blinding me to the really nice things happening in my life, but still I can't leave it. No online sex addiction involved, just really drawn by the idea of creating characters.)",

            "selftext": "Sorry super long one. Long time reddit lurker but rarely post. Apologies for grammar/spelling etc. \n\nSo I\u2019m British and I\u2019m an expat in China. It\u2019s been really hard and it\u2019s very isolating and I had a really traumatic relationship that put me off dating for a while. I then re-activated my OkCupid account and I wasn\u2019t having much luck. His profile stood out so much and he actually replied to me. We connected right away and it escalated from there. \n\nI\u2019m a pretty intense person which I warned him about and I like to put all my flaws up front. I try to be as self aware as I can and I\u2019m always trying to grow and improve myself as I have struggled with my mental health since I was a child. \n\nHe\u2019s 30yrs old. He had a very traumatic childhood, became an addict as a teen and got sober over 1.5yrs and now works for the rehab clinic that helped him. He had also ended a really long term, traumatic and abusive relationship 1yr ago. He\u2019s quite spiritual, I\u2019m not but I like that about him. He kept saying how we met at the right time in our lives and that we are soul mates. I feel connected to him in a way I\u2019ve never felt with anyone before and if I believed in souls I think it\u2019s a sweet idea that we were meant to find each other. \n\nWe\u2019ve talked every day for the past five months, through texts, phone calls and video calls. We\u2019ve had our ups and downs.  His ex reconnected with him, he pushed me away saying I was too good for him. Slept with his ex and relapsed. Called me apologising saying he made a huge mistake. He only told me about sleeping with his ex. A month later he admitted his relapse. \n\nI\u2019m a very understanding person, I don\u2019t like to demonise people for their behaviours because we are all human and we fuck up. Over the past year I\u2019ve learnt a lot about addiction/recovery because my Nan is an alcoholic and my mother is going a similar way and I\u2019m scared for them and myself. I love listening to podcasts audiobooks about depression, mindfulness, recovery etc. I listened to a booked called \u2018Chasing the Rainbow\u2019 by Poorna Bell who fell in love with and lost her husband who was a heroin addict. It was heart breaking but so insightful.  \n\nWe moved on, he promised he would go to meetings again and he started seeing a therapist. I\u2019ve asked him to look out for a sponsor but for now he calls me when he\u2019s struggling and we talk through it and he was doing so well. \n\nI saved up the past couple of months and I\u2019ve flown out to meet him in America. We were both so excited and happy that we were finally going to be next to each other. My job is really hard and I don\u2019t really enjoy living in China but I don\u2019t want to go back to the UK and I can\u2019t afford to move to another country. \n\nHis roommate kicks him out last week and he gets really distant. I give him space but also check in on him from time to time. He stays awake all night Thursday night and we call. He says he\u2019s had a few beers and that\u2019s why he\u2019s slurring but I know he\u2019s high. He just wasn\u2019t ready to tell me so I don\u2019t push it, I just want to make sure he doesn\u2019t end up sleeping on the streets. I just try to stay positive that I\u2019m going to be with him soon. \n\nSo I arrived in the states Friday morning. It\u2019s been rough, he tells me about Thursday night and he feels so guilty he will hardly look at me or touch me. I know he hates himself but relapse is a part of recovery right? None of this is easy and I never expected it to be. We both knew the risks and we agreed it was worth it. It still is for me, I\u2019m pretty good at looking after myself and he makes me so happy. He\u2019s such a kind and wonderful human being. He\u2019s so empathic and he is so good at his job at helping other addicts. \n\nHe\u2019s said that he\u2019s lost and empty. He doesn\u2019t know if he can put me through this anymore but doesn\u2019t want to loose me or hurt me. His therapist said last week (in his third session) that he shouldn\u2019t be in a relationship and she got really quiet when he told her that I\u2019m coming to visit him. I\u2019ve told him that if he thinks I\u2019m hindering his recovery I would distance myself for his sake, that we can just be friends. I love him so much I just want him to be happy even if it means breaking my heart. \n\nHe says he loves me and wants us to keep working on what we have, he\u2019s just afraid of loosing himself by being with me and hurting me because of his own mental health and addictions. He says he doesn\u2019t deserve me or happiness. He hasn\u2019t eaten anything for two days. He looks exhausted. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do? Should I end things for his sake and support him as a friend? I\u2019ve never loved anyone this much before. I ask now and again about going to meetings, he recognises he needs to go but doesn\u2019t. \n\nI also would really like to have friends to talk to about what it\u2019s like to be with an addict. I want to connect with more addicts to learn more. Please feel free to reach out to me. I\u2019m feeling quiet scared and lost myself right now. \n\nTLDR: Fell madly in love with an addict, he relapsed and feels like he doesn\u2019t deserve me. Also says he loves me so much he doesn\u2019t want to loose me. I don\u2019t know what to do? I just want what\u2019s best for him.",

            "selftext": "I don\u2019t really know who to talk to or where to ask, but I really need help because this could eventually become life or death for my friend. So my best friend and I have been friends since birth. We have literally done everything with each other. Which would include all of the good and bad times. He\u2019s had an interesting childhood, his parents split fairly early on, so his mom decided to go back to school and finish becoming a nurse. Which meant that he was unsupervised a lot during his young years, most of the time he would end up just coming over to my house to hang out because we lived in the same neighborhood. He also moved from his mom to his dad a lot, and I know that was hard for him growing up. And as a quick side note, his dad literally didn\u2019t care what he did, but his mom was fairly strict but very loving. Around 9th grade he moved out of my neighborhood because his mom got remarried and lived farther away so I didn\u2019t get to see him as much. Also, around this time is when he began to experiment with drugs. Mainly just alcohol and pot. It wasn\u2019t crazy or out of hand at this point, I just didn\u2019t care for it but I never let it bother me. Even to this day drinking and smoking aren\u2019t my thing, maybe thanks to him. I still stayed in touch with him through the years and we were still super close despite rarely seeing each other. He also told me stories about how he would move from his moms to his dads a lot. But I know he would only move to the other parent if he had a problem with them. But finally he moved back into my neighborhood with his mom and stepdad around the end of our 11th grade year. Although he was mainly moving back because his grandparents weren\u2019t doing too well, it was still great to see him more often and help him through his tough time.  After a couple times we hung out I noticed that he was beginning to smoke more and more, like a few times a day almost everyday, which was a huge step up from the last time I really hung out with him. Also I started to have to lie about his smoking habits to my and his parents because they always suspected that he did, but I would make them think otherwise. He still lived in that house with his mom even after his grandparents passed away. We eventually started 12th grade together at school, and that was so awesome! However he was having a tough time making it to school on time because his parents would argue late into the night, so he had trouble falling asleep. He also mentioned to me that he would smoke in the morning and in the evenings to help him sleep, and a lot in between those times. As alarming as that sounded to me, I didn\u2019t do a whole lot other than ask him not do it around me. In the spring time of our senior years is when it got really bad. He dropped out of school because he was missing so many days of school that there was no point in going. He would flake out on me and hang out with his other stoner friends which happened a lot. Although I hated when he did that, he always apologized and made up some stupid excuse. He also began to experiment with other drugs like cocaine and acid ( I didn\u2019t find out about this until later). But I finally totally distanced myself from him when he yelled and hit his mother, calling her a monster and wishing he was never born. He then moved to live with his dad.\n\nAt this point I stopped talking to him to recollect myself, because I saw this as unnecessary stress and I needed to start focus on getting into college. Also, I saw this as an opportunity for him to find his own way, and I was tired of getting treated badly and always having to pick him up only for him to resort back to his original problems. I know it wasn\u2019t the total right thing to do but I just figured if I was able to catch him back at his low point, I could help him again when he actually really needs it.   \n\n4 months go by of us not talking, and it just goes straight downhill for him (or at least from where I\u2019m seeing it). Apparently he has a job, which is good for him, but he spends all of his money on drugs and parts for his jeep instead of spending on what he needs to be spending it on like paying off his apartment. So because of that, he is about to be behind in payments of his apartment, and may eventually get kicked out. I don\u2019t know what his exact plans for college are, because I don\u2019t think he has enough money saved to afford that and if he can, he\u2019s just going to go to school to party. I\u2019ve heard a couple of stories about him from some credible people. Like: He\u2019s been in two drinking and driving accidents. He was passenger for both, but him and the person driving were hammered and crashed into a pole. Didn\u2019t die thankfully. Another person said that his roommate does cocaine at the least, so my friend is not living in good conditions at all. All his roommates encourage his self destructive behavior. All of my friends that have interacted with him have told me that when they confront him about his behavior he\u2019s in total disbelief, and begins to get very defensive when they say he has a problem. There was a couple of others but I may remember them a bit more in further updates. But I knew after all of this that I never should\u2019ve left him alone. I haven\u2019t seen him in forever so after discussing this with some friends I tried to come up with a plan to see how he was going. \n\nI found out this morning that we were working on the same shift. \n\nI sent him a text yesterday evening just asking him how he was doing. So when I saw him this morning, he looked happy to see me, and it felt so weird having a conversation with him again. Especially because after all of the horrible stories I heard about him, he seemed perfectly fine. Later before the place opened, I got to chat with him 1 on 1. At first it was normal, I was asking him how things are, but the burning question of \u201cwhy are you doing this?\u201d eventually overwhelmed me. So I confronted him too, telling him all of the stories I\u2019ve heard and how I\u2019m worried about him. He began to get super aggressive and said none of those stories were true. Which is understandable because what if the person that told me this was for some reason wrong? However, when I told him how I felt about him ditching me for other people even though we had plans with each other, he said that I was wrong and that he doesn\u2019t even know why I feel like that because it never happened. That kind of surprised me. He said that I was lying about how I felt? Also, when we started talking about drugs, I told him how I was worried about him and the way he was using them was super addictive and wasn\u2019t the right coping mechanism for what he\u2019s been going through. He told me at first that he has been clean for a month and that he\u2019s happier than he\u2019s ever been. Which sounded great but his vibe was just off, and I know that wasn\u2019t true because I saw him smoking on another persons snapchat story. So I told him that, and he said well I never said I was smoking my weed. And I said okay, \u201cwell when was the last time you smoked\u201d and he said \u201cyesterday\u201d then I said \u201cwhen was the time before that\u201d and \u201che said the day before\u201d. So then I commented that he basically smokes everyday, ( in the morning and in the evening at least but probably more) and that he\u2019s self dependent on that. And he was so sure to me that I was crazy and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about. And I mentioned to him that he\u2019s in total denial, and he was just started laughing saying I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about and that he doesn\u2019t need my help. And after that we both just walked away in disgust.\n\nSo for some of you that do smoke, sure maybe it isn\u2019t that much, and I would imagine it is a good past time. I know for some of you this may sound super stupid and I\u2019m sorry about that. But for him, this is such a problem that he\u2019s just doing it so he doesn\u2019t have to be sober at all again. \n\nPlease help me I\u2019m so confused. I\u2019m just so disappointed that I lost my best friend to this. I still very much care about him but I feel like to him that I\u2019m just in the way of his next high or buzz. I\u2019m definitely not trained in this area, so I don\u2019t know where to begin. But i\u2019m just totally lost if I\u2019m supposed to just leave him alone for good now, or stay close to him but have him constantly pissed off at me? \n\nI\u2019m open to any suggestion or advice. Also I\u2019m happy to clear up any gaps and questions with the story. Thank you all!",

            "selftext": "Hi Reddit! \n\nI posted my adderall recovery journey 3-4 months ago and a few users suggested I post it every few months in case others find it useful. Im going to try to remember to do that so here it is: \n\nI quit after taking this stuff for 10 years and haven\u2019t touched it in over 15 months. This is all just MY EXPERIENCE and others may have a different opinion but for me, this is what it took. I\u2019m not here to judge anyone else or say what\u2019s right/wrong, this is simply my journey. \n\nI had to go cold turkey. I tried quitting many times but cold turkey is all that ever worked. Everything else is just denial or an excuse. I told myself I would taper down or slowly stop or whatever but I just needed to STOP and stop making excuses. I found reading other people\u2019s Journey was helpful when I was trying to quit so here\u2019s mine in the event it gives you even an ounce of conviction or strength. \n\nI took Adderall for 10 years (21-31) and quit just over a year ago. I live in San Francisco and have a VERY demanding, fast paced job in tech where I manage a team so that was the part that made me the most nervous but I realized I was picking everything else over my Health. I got to a point where I \u201cneeded\u201d adderall to be \u201cme\u201d - so was that even me? It was so so hard for the first 2-3 months, I was so tired and felt like a zombie but was just gentle as fuck with myself and after the 3 month mark I felt functional. Around the 5-6 month mark I felt GOOD. Actually, like a new person.\n\nNever in a trillion years did the old adderall me ever think I\u2019d be able to be disciplined/productive without it - but here I am.... happy, have normal energy like a normal human, just as successful in my job (I def underperformed for those 3-4 months - keeping my head above water professionally was the hardest part but treating each day I said \u201cno\u201d to adderall as a victory was how I got by). Reading stories on here and quittingadderall.com helped (make an account - distract yourself by engaging on there). Exercising first thing in the AM before my brain could realize how tired it was.\n\nI was VERY hungry so cooking/prepping healthy food was key as well. Fresh, whole fruits/veg. L-tyrosine, magnesium, fish oil and other vitamins that may or may not have helped but I did like the \u201ctradition\u201d of taking pills every morning (they probably helped - there\u2019s a lot of info online about different things you can take to help with brain health as you recover). I even took pre workout powder with water each AM in the beginning to get a little kick. Whatever it took. Time, sleep, clean eating, exercise/moving, coffee, distraction/quittingadderall.com, supplements.. that\u2019s what did it. In that order. I also found not eating after 7pm really helped with the morning brain fog. \n\nMy point: I remember it very clearly. For years. The guilt of taking this drug. I went through all the normal phases of first discovering it, LOVING the shit out of it, everything was suddenly so amazing (until it wasn\u2019t), becoming uber successful professionally (and subsequently setting a standard at work that\u2019s just not humanely sustainable), then slowly realizing that I didn\u2019t \u201cfeel\u201d like I used to. That maybe I was a bit of a productivity robot. I felt I needed adderall to be the talkative, fun friend everyone expected me to be (creating anxiety). That maybe I just needed to accept that I WAS adderall. I NEEDED adderall.\n\nAnd then the \u201cok I\u2019m not addicted. I\u2019ll just have a few a week. I don\u2019t need to quit full stop... maybe just half of one a day.... or maybe I just stop for a little bit and see how I feel so I should just keep this bottle handy in case it doesn\u2019t go well\u201d \u2014\u2014 then I listened to that insane, dependent mental negotiation I was doing with myself and realized \u201cyeeeeep, that\u2019s an addicts negotiation tactic.\u201d This is not healthy.\n\nI always made excuses for needing it ..... a big project, a friends bachelorette party, an event, whatever. I even went through the denial phase of \u201cthis is a medication. I have ADHD. My medical doctor gave me this. It\u2019s medicine!\u201d Oh brother, that was the hardest phase because I knew deeeeeep down I was in denial grasping at such an easy excuse for myself (this is just my own experience I\u2019m sharing here - to each their own).\n\nThen I realized that I have a very full life so there would always be an excuse. Was i really so insecure that I didn\u2019t think the \u201cundrugged\u201d me could handle it? I then realized I didn\u2019t even know me - was I willing to live an entire lifetime without ever knowing my authentic self? I was so scared.\n\nI started by committing to one day at a time, mini goals. And, like I said, every day was celebrated like a victory. \u201cJust one more day, one more week\u201d \u2014- the first 2-3 months I was a sleeping, sitting-at-desking, eating, slow-mo exercising machine. I felt like I got hit by a truck. Then it got better. Then it got ok. Then it got good. Then it got great. Now I feel amazing. Don\u2019t get me wrong - I don\u2019t feel HIGH. I feel like a normal human with normal waves of emotion (tiredness, energy, creativity, anger, sadness, happiness, excitement, laughter, everything). Normal waves - not extreme waves like addy gives you. It\u2019s so good to be alive and get to know me. Anyone can be \u201csomeone\u201d on adderall and there are very similar traits \u2014 but there\u2019s only one you. Get to know you. The playful you. It\u2019ll take a while to get back that person so be patient and loving with yourself. Don\u2019t think that whoever you meet the first few months is the new you. It\u2019s not. It takes a little longer.\n\nI am also amazed at how capable I am. I think back to 7-8 months ago and I feel like I PRODUCE just as much at work. I\u2019m not hyper focused with quick witted things to say in meetings \u2014 but I get my shit done, I get it done well, and I feel ... real.\n\nI remember the struggle. I remember the self doubt. I remember the fear. I still think of adderall every day and occasionally want it, but I mostly think \u201cI can\u2019t believe I fucking took that capsule full of little toxic beads every single day for 10 years - wtf was I thinking?\u201d \u2014- which is major progress from what I felt for the first few months (\u201cI just want one. Just half of one. I\u2019ll start next week\u201d).\n\nIt takes time, discipline and self love. I\u2019d say the self love is was kept my drive to stay off of it high \u2014 I\u2019ve worked hard on myself throughout my life and deserve to be as healthy as I\u2019m capable of being. I want to have a family some day and they deserve a healthy me as well. Why rob myself of that.\n\nI\u2019m sorry this is so long but the details are important. It\u2019s not easy.  Please feel free to DM me if I can help. You got this. You\u2019re capable and amazing without any drugs - get excited to get to know the real you. The undrugged, pure you.",

            "selftext": "Hey all... I'm a grateful human who has recovered from a major addiction from all drugs... there isn't anything I want using so I have experienced different addictions like from the physical intensity of heroin withdrawal to understanding the mental dependency from stimulants and so on. I've been clean and sober for 2 years and have maintained a 4.0 average since I started back school 3 semesters ago. Now regarding my question... throughout my time of sobriety I have kept out of contact with any of my dealers even the one I considered a \"friend\". On a couple of occasions   my old \"dealer friends\" would call me to see how I'm doing but I would just tell them I'm fine and go on with my day but, recently one called to say hello and he happened to tell me he has a lawn service. I didn't pay it any mind but my mom has been looking for a lawn guy and I remembered him and gave him a call to come by and give us a quote and possibly do the job. I'm pretty sure he is still In his old ways... I don't know if by calling him and having a relationship with him will stir up old feelings or if I'll just be able to stay on track. I'm not thinking about using but I'm posting this for some thoughts on what you may think. Do you think this behavior is risky even though I don't want to use and feel like it's just a business relationship I can't help but to think of the past just a lil bit now that I have contacted him to do this job for my family. Am I engaging in risky behavior in your opinion?",

For the past 2 months I haven\u2019t gotten more than 5 hours of sleep because of my constant need to go onto the internet and I dread it. I\u2019m always tired and exhausted, I staying up and do nothing but browse the internet. I remember for a period of time My internet addiction ended up finding a central point. I had like an actual serious problem with the classic game tetris, I know it\u2019s sounds silly but it really was a problem. I\u2019d play this specific game for like 7-8 hours straight a day and it just started seeping Into everything else in my life. At school my mind would just go blank and I would start thinking of strategies and different runs. I couldn\u2019t keep up with conversations or enjoy a movie because I could only think of tetris. It got to the point where I could not psychically sleep because the thought of tetris plagued my mind.  I\u2019d obsess over methods to get a tetris or a full clean board. After a while I got tired of the insomnia and decided to quit entirely it was very difficult where I had to shut my computer off to prevent myself from playing. Although lately I\u2018ve disappointed myself, playing tetris time to time I think I managed to gain a bit more self control but the overall internet addiction is still a thing. I shut myself in my room and turn down most offers to go out because I want to go on the internet. I really hope I don\u2019t spend my whole life like this",

I've had a few extremely stressful things that have happened recently and I really want to drink. \n\n\n\nI've been drinking every night for 3 months about. I even take over the counter sleeping pills on top of this (a somewhat safe amount, benadryl) and this morning I felt like complete shit and decided I will cold turkey today, it's not going so well so far.\n\n\nI've had an on/off drug problem since I was 15-16 (I'm 27, a functioning addict that has been sticking to alcohol in the night time only). To give you an idea of my fucked up head, I use to be a heroin addict but quit in 2014. I've always had a problem with substances, mainly opiates.\n\n\n\nRight now as I'm typing this, I have really really bad anxiety. I've been pacing around in my room just saying \"I can't do this, I'm fucked up\" and talking to myself about how much I'm a fuckup (I know, I feel crazy). I didn't know this would be this much of a problem. Something good has also happened in my life (a career-related opportunity offer), but I just keep looping negative thoughts in my head. More negative things have happened than good things. I've been stuck with this anxiety for a few hours now and I just wish I can pass out but I can't. My body knows it's missing something.\n\n\nSince I wasn't a full on alcoholic (mornings/afternoons I'm sober for school, but night time never sober in the past 3 months), I won't have to worry about physical withdrawals, I don't feel them, but I'm stuck with a lot of anxiety. What the hell can I do to relieve myself with out a drug/drink ? I feel so uncomfortable in my skin and most importantly my brain, I'm tired of having these negative thoughts. I didn't realize I've been drowning this many problems in my head. This is so cliche but I don't like feeling negative shit because it fucks with my goals/motivation so I use drugs to block them out.\n\n\n\nThanks for the advice. I don't want to talk about my personal problems with people I know in real life (especially my mother and immediate family). Thank you.",

Also I have seen a red mark appears on my hand after a few days if I have been doing coke,,when I push the mark, it feels like a bad bruise, but I have no idea why it keeps on coming back...\n\nThank you for your input guys, I know can rely on you to be honest and that",

My dad is an alcoholic and has been for about 30 years. My mom has had issues with benzodiazepine and opiate addiction. My little sister passed away from an opiate overdoes. My older sister is awaiting her prison sentence for selling and doing drugs since she was 13. My cousin died from an OD.

            "selftext": "I was always a person that was anti everything, drinking, smoking and drugs, it all had to do with my biological father, whom I haven\u2019t spoken with in about 6-7 years now, smoked like a chimney, drank by himself and always saw the comedowns and was always just a negative, lazy and aggressive person. First I turned 18 and had a drink, which was inevitable, then a breakup turned me to smoking socially into almost a pack a day and then it turned into the little bag of white gold. Then it just started going downhill from there. I tried it on a night out for a birthday I went to and was good because it kept me sober and having that right amount for coke dick wow. Did it that one time then tried it again maybe 3-4 months later when I went on a holiday and did about 2.5-3GS, again drinking like an animal and coke dick. Then once I got back home, it was really every time I went out I wanted to do it purely to not get a hangover. Then for the last month or so, it\u2019s just been bag after bag after bag, at work, at home, driving, just thinking when the next line or bumps gonna be and I can\u2019t take it when I can\u2019t get my hands on it sometimes. My partner used to tolerate drugs and smoke a joint or do a line here and there, but she\u2019s absolutely turned off cocaine now and she\u2019s caught me out at least 4 times doing it behind her back, she said the next time she finds out, she would tell my mother and that\u2019s just what happened. Now, my mother has always been anti drugs, that\u2019s why she left my dad, guy was always on something and just thought he could never have a good time without it, she took me out of a household like that so I\u2019d never be surrounded by it or tempted and raise me to be anything but him, \nWhen my mum sat me down the other day and poured her heart out regarding the topic, her tears, her shaky voice and the sense of disappointment made me break, I could not believe the burden I had put on to my own mother, when she raised me to be better than that and to never succumb to this. To add to this, my mum has since remarried, my step dad is honestly one of the greatest guys I\u2019ve ever met and as well having a little 6 year old brother in the house, now she\u2019s  always been a mum where she\u2019ll always support me, let me stay at home for as long as I want as long as I\u2019m doing something with my life and have goals and wouldn\u2019t ever throw me out of the house and onto the street, but when this all unfolded, she said if I don\u2019t stop, she said she would never, ever let me live with them or see them again, it struck me so bad when she said, \u201cwhat would I tell your brother where you\u2019ve gone and to tell him his brothers gone and out of our lives forever\u201d, man that shit broke me, on another level. I cried on her shoulder continuously for at least half an hour, I was beyond broken, yet she still comforted me, hugged me and told me everything will be alright and we\u2019ll move past this and again be strong, spoke to me like I had done nothing wrong. \n\nI need advice, how to handle the coke and get it out of my life, once and for all, anybody, please\ud83d\ude14",

Intoxicating yourself (with alcohol, benzodiazepines) so that *you do not feel anxious* is not coping; it\u2019s *avoidance.* Saying that you drink to \u201ccope\u201d with anxiety is like saying that you dropped out of university to \u201ccope\u201d with the stress of exams. That\u2019s not coping; it\u2019s *running away from your problems.* Don\u2019t get it twisted.\n\nThis beliefs promotes continued use because it works to **legitimatize** continued drug/alcohol abuse. If we tell ourselves that we\u2019re intoxicating ourselves in order to *cope* with \\[negative life event, undesirable feeling\\], then we have *more* of a legitimate reason to intoxicate ourselves. The person who is intoxicating themselves \u201cto cope with trauma\u201d garners more sympathy than the person who intoxicate themselves \"for pleasure.\"\n\nThe world is full of people who live with severe mental health issues, who have endured horrible trauma, and they **do not** abuse drugs and alcohol. When you tell yourself \u201cI\u2019m *coping* with \\[negative life event, undesirable feeling\\],\u201d what you are actually doing is *coming up with an \\[illegitimate\\] excuse to keep getting drunk/high.*\n\nAre you depressed? Let the doctor tell you what kind of drugs you should be taking, if any. Go to the gym, exercise. Talk to a friend. Volunteer; do some good in your community. Meet with a counsellor and talk about your issues; come up with an action plan. These are all legitimate coping strategies. You don\u2019t \u201ccope\u201d with depression by getting drunk and snorting cocaine. That is not a coping skill; it\u2019s *avoidance.* Furthermore, drinking/doing drugs will *aggravate* any mental health problems you have, in the long run. Drinking when you have an anxiety disorder is like smoking cigarettes when you have lung cancer.",

            "selftext": "I just wanted to put this out here , i don't know anyone  else who takes benadryl as a drug or for its high. I hope anyone who does stop asap as the risks and damage benadryl will do to you is terrible. I just wanted to let this out as I'm embarrassed to talk to this about anyone and this is anon so... here I go\n\nI(18F) think i might be addicted to benadryl. This started 2 weeks ago where i got a sore throat and my mom told me to take benadryl and cough syrup before bed. I wake up with a sore throat still (obviously as it takes 3-6 days for it to be gone but this one was minor as it was from me smoking ..) but it's not as bad as it was before so i continue til my sore throat is gone and it goes away after 3 days and I still take the benadryl til today which is when i stop as I realized im addicted to it.I ofc know benadryl makes you sleepy which is why i love it , I sleep like a baby when i take 5 which is really bad as it can damage the liver and i can possibly od but ... I don't really care ?? I ofc do but I take it without knowing i took 5 in a span of 3 hours it's bad. My friends worry about me as they know when i took a benadryl as i'm tired when we hang out and it's literally 3pm. my worse day was friday last week which is when i saw this guy i have a thing with and even he was like how are you tired ? it's only 4:40! are you okay?? and i'm like yes and i lie and say i had to take a benadryl , when in reality i took 3 in a span of 2 hours and i took one right before i went over to his house. Idk how I stopped , I think it's when i realized I have to wake up really early so i didn't take one but i'm honestly glad i stopped. i'm just afraid i will continue on this bad habit tomorrow and i don't know how to control it, I get conflicted as it does help me sleep where i do have trouble sleeping. I know about melatonin but can't you get addicted to those ?? I didnt do much research on them but i'd rather hear from someone who has used it and want to know if they found themselves addicted/dependent on it. thank you",

I smoke more than I eat, and I smoke when I\u2019m not asleep for the most part. Several times a day if I can. When I run out, I turn into a fiend off what resin I still have and what I haven\u2019t scrounged from my ash pile. And if a friend or family member of mine has a pen or something I fiend off that, not by trying to steal it or anything but I just can\u2019t NOT smoke in me. I need the exhilarating head flow and that rush when I hear that one song by 6ix9ine ft. A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie- WAKA. It\u2019s lit.\n\nIn all seriousness, I have a problem with needing marijuana and I think it helps me with my anxiety and depression. I\u2019ve only been smoking for 2 years but I\u2019ve been Lil Wayne high for like a whole year now. When I ask myself why I think I need it, the same voice in my head always tells me because \u201clife is a fucking drag\u201d. If I don\u2019t have weed, I need something to always make up for it, I take metropolol and I took one more than I should just to make up for not having any weed because I knew the next day would be a drag without it in the hopes that it would be reminiscent of Xanax. I feel very lost all the time but with goals on my mind. I don\u2019t think any of this really matters, there\u2019s plenty of other people with much worse addictions than myself",

I\u2019ve lost 10lbs and I\u2019m fucking destroying my sleep schedule and physical health. \n\nI want to stop, I don\u2019t have anymore left and I blocked/deleted all my plugs and I don\u2019t want to see them ever again. \n\nToday I had my first appointment with a psychiatrist and she basically said she could not move forward with any treatment until I go to a rehabilitation facility and get completely sober. \n\nI had a similar experience last year with my therapist, she refused to see me any longer after I told her I was abusing adderall, unless I went to 30 day inpatient. I couldn\u2019t at the time because of my responsibilities and even when I got clean myself she didn\u2019t want to see me. It\u2019s a shame because therapy was really doing me good. \n\nI see what\u2019s happening - multiple mental health professionals are recommending rehab for me. It\u2019s a huge bummer because I just wanted someone to talk to and I feel like I\u2019m being turned away, even though I know they are just offering better specialized help and antidepressants+whatever I\u2019m putting into my body is probably a bad idea. \n\nMy immediate family is all alcoholics and I know addiction is chronic. Is 30 inpatient what is best? Is there anything else I can do, group meetings etc? I can elaborate further if anyone has questions. Im just so sad, I really thought I had someone to talk to today and all she had was the rehab pamphlet. I\u2019m going to get assessed this weekend anyway, then I have to make a decision. \n\nThanks",

I have been an IV meth, coke, and heroin addict since I was 17 and now I'm 36. After countless attempts at straightening up through inpatient treatment centers and medication assisted programs I finally got the longest period of 16 months clean. I got back into good university making A's and on way to biology major. I am working a solid 12 step program in AA and also attend NA. I have great sponsor and couple sponsees. I became financially stable and was able to get a sweet car and own place. I thought I was over the hump as long as I kept doing the deal. Over the past few months I became very dissatisfied with my level of happiness and serenity. I gained little more weight than I intended but topped out at 220 lbs at 6'3\".  I don't know why I decided that it was not a big deal to shoot up some meth yesterday but I instantly regretted it. I know this is just part of being an addict and relapse is sometimes just a part of the journey. \nI would be really grateful for some words of wisdom and hope.  I am very much aware that I am going to have to be honest with certain people in recovery including my sponsor and myself. So if there's something else that you see that I may be missing please let me know. \n\nThanks for your time,\nJohn Doe",

            "selftext": "So here's a little background on me. About a year ago I used to do coke pretty often. Maybe around like a gram and a half every weekend. I used to do it in a very specific way. I never liked taking it with others or in parties because I used to love to masturbate while on it.  I would do for hours. I live on the bordering towns near Mexico so I would get pretty good stuff from a local drug dealer.  I did this religiously going to the point where I would masturbate and do coke till I was dehydrated and borderline going to have a heart attack. The rush was amazing. i would just go at it until I felt I was on the verge of climaxing and I would do another line or two and continue on for hours. At first, when I was clean I would get massive cravings anytime I was aroused but later on it got better and I didn't feel the need to use.  But recently I've been getting so annoying and I've been thinking about just succumbing to my cravings just to subside them because when I got off of it I went cold turkey. Maybe this is just me trying to justify some usage. I just don't want to feel like I'm not in control. I masturbate to get rid of the feelings but now that isn't helping. Have any of you gone through the same thing",

I want to leave, but I have a week left before I go back to my mom's house. She's an enabler and constantly gives me weed, which is my drug of choice. For the last couple days I've been abusing alcohol because I don't have anymore marijuana. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSocially it's hard because drug use is social in my circles. I'll be going to a dry retreat towards the end of the month but I have a good few weeks between then and now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel bored and triggered just by essence of being where I am right now.

Ive kept all my other problems and addictions at bay for such a long time now and I just want to stop drinking now.\n\nI worry that if I have to wait another week or so for home detox meds it will be too long for me. Rehab is also out of the question as its expensive and the NHS one is an even longer wait, would take like 9 weeks to get in one.",

I was abusing GHB the last couple of weeks and it's just gotten out of hand. I want to be healthy again. My arms and legs have a few meth scabs on them and I feel absolutely horrible. Also pretending to be clean when I'm not is exhausting/makes me feel like a shitty human.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother main factor is that I cannot afford to keep using ice and GHB daily. My savings account makes me want to cry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't have work until next Tuesday. My plan is to sleep tomorrow and over the weekend and recuperate at home with nutritious food. Next week Ill be using coffee and modafinal to help with tiredness at work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have Netflix, an amazing book to finish, and people I can call  for help if need be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny other tips?",

            "selftext": "A few months ago I reconnected with an old girlfriend of mine. Back when we had our fling she was in a failing, trustless, marrige and coping by using lots of pills. As one could imagine this didn't work out for any of us.\n\nIn the coming years she went on to date other men, one of which was a drug dealer and abused her a great deal. He used her addiction against her to keep her doing what he wanted and physically harmed her multiple times.\n\nNow, a few months ago, we met back up by absolute chance and hit it off as if we had never stopped talking. She had been through rehab. Clean for nearly half a year. Regularly attending meetings and doing great. I know that relationships are frowned upon in the program during someone's first year so I (and we both) have been very careful to keep it slow and casual for the time being. Just trying to offer her more support.\n\nAs I got to talk to her though it was clear that her demons were in her ear every waking second and she was struggling terribly every waking moment. Spending most of her clean time sleeping or trying to sleep the time oit of existence. Then the demons won.\n\nFirst someone offered her some dope and she took it. Then a bit of ice. Both her docs and absolute weakness.\n\nWe spent 2 weeks of me taking her to meetings and taking phone calls at 4am just to sing her back to sleep and spend the night worrying if she was going to succumb to the drugs or worse physically harm herself.\n\nShe spent almost 2 weeks getting herself back on track but clearly struggling worse than I had ever seen her with the drugs fresh in her mind and presence. I tried everything from oversaturating kindness to sarcasm to tough love but eventually she ended up with ice in her hands.\n\nThis was last Saturday. I was working and received a picture of the white crystals in a dollar bill. For 2 days she was in and out of contact until finally she asked me to come spend time with her Monday morning when I got out of work (my 2nd job is overnight).\n\nWe spent the morning together but after a few hours she decided to break out the drugs and try to entice me. I refused. She instead did them right in front of me. Then again this repeated a few hours later.\n\nIt was then that the true helplessness of my situation really kicked in. Not even me being present in the room and refusing the subject could stop her from doing it. Then I begin to ask myself is there anything at all that I could do that would do any good?\n\nAs of this afternoon she was up for 5 days using crystal and hasn't responded to me for hours. The hole in my gut feels like rotting wood.\n\nBoth this woman and my sister (also a recovering addict with over 3 years clean now, so very proud of her) have read me the riot act about how it's more difficult to date an addict than to be one and have told me about how good and bad times will come and go and she won't be able to identify with the fact that she's doing things that are hurting me until after they've happened.\n\nMy problem being that regardless if I continue to be in a romantic relationship with this woman I still love her as a person. I've known her for over half a decade it's not like we just met and I could turn around and forget her. I'd still be constantly worried if not more because if I told her we can't continue romantically she will most likely isolate herself.\n\n\nTl;dr I've put myself in a difficult position and need some help helping the woman I love. \n\n\nAnyone else have a similar experience? Any advice? Maybe just anyone who is reading this that wants to talk about anything at all? Are you struggling with an addict or are you an addict yourself that needs someone to talk to? The nights are lonely wondering where she is and if she's okay.\n\nThe things we do for love.\n\nStay strong everyone. There is a life worth living out there somewhere.",

I gave her my terms of either going to rehab or packing her shit and leaving, she went and got help now she is in our closest mental institution (she has also been wanting to self harm as well found that out today also)so that way she can have the assessment done as well.\n\nShe keeps blaming it on the person that told me that they are just trying to start shit but i think she is just trying to find someone else to put the blame on. she called me a few hours ago and said that she hates me and says that she thinks this is a little extreme for what she did, at the time I didnt care I was so angry and hurt that I didnt, but now all I can hear in my head is her saying that she hates me...\n\n  \n\n\nDid I go to far??",

            "selftext": "I have not done Xans for quite some time before this probably almost a whole year (I don't remember the exact day) since I quit. Regardless I was losing everything I loved in life mainly my girl friend.  She had had enough of my BS and I couldn't blame her.  She flushed my stash and I have been clean since. (Thanks to her!!!) I still smoke weed but no more pills at all and she is okay with this.  Recently I came across some Blue Bars the 2mg actual bars.  I have always seen yellow, green, white but never blue so I was already intrigued as horrible as that sounds.  My weed-man had some and I ended up caving and getting 3 bars on the front.  This is where it spirals out of control.  I ended up getting in debt 60 bucks for xans over 2 days and to cover my debt I lied to my girl friend and told her I needed 60 bucks to pay my car insurance.  Keep in mind we have a perfect relationship and we always have talked about our issues and she is aware of my addiction issues and she is a great women and only wants the best for me.  She is the best thing that has ever happened to me and I always ruin shit in these ways.  Anyways 2 days into my bender on these bars she goes through my phone because lets face it when your Z'd out you can tell..... What made her look was I had gotten an email about my car insurance NOT being paid.  She woke me up from my Xan coma and confronted me and I came clean.  I am so crushed that I broke her trust.  I am since clean for 2 days now and back to somewhat a normal head on my shoulders.  I have tons of reasons I could blame for caving because I am going through a lot but that is no excuse for my actions. In reality I need to man up and cherish what I have.  The worst part is the way I treated her when she confronted me.  I was mean and verbally abusive and acting like it was all her fault like a spoiled brat.  I am ashamed of myself and I know I am better than this and I can beat this addiction.  Especially with the love and support of my girl friend......  I needed to get this off my chest Thanks for whoever is reading.  I have also found a new weed-man as well.",

Then i decide to go cold turkey and the next two weeks-month are a mix of hell and happiness. Today is day two of going sober again and the anxiety is killing me. Over the years ive had two seizures because of drinking. i cant seem to get myself to go to a meeting or see a doctor. my mental health has deteriorated quite a bit over the last year. depression and anxiety fucking suck. my girlfriends bday party was the cause of this last one. just need to get this off my chest 15 min before i leave for work as a bartender (great right?) in hopes this will ease the pain. this sub reddit has helped me before so why not try again. im fucking desperate",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI have been clean from alcohol and drugs for about 7 months now, but the sex addiction that was lurking in the background has now taken over from where the drugs left off. \n\nI tried to get clean a few weeks ago, but have been failing miserably. Every day I spend a few hours surfing for porn and masturbating. I masturbate 4 times in a row usually and am never satisfied. I have sex and am never satisfied. Thankfully I haven't cheated on my partner and every girl that I know I could have sex or am tempted to have sex with is no longer a part of my life. Unfortunately it has led to the loss of some friendships, but if that is what I have to do for my recovery then it is what is best in the moment. I can always repair them when I am clean.\n\nThe problem I am having is that my sexual thoughts never stop and I have become obsessed with sex to an extreme degree. Every girl that I see I fantasize about. I just can't stop the feelings. They don't pass. They float through my mind until I can't take it anymore. I fantasize about asking girls to spend time with me in situations in which I know I can make a move on them and know they will be interested. I am by no means a smooth person, but I have never had a problem finding partners who are willing to binge on sex with. I am not disinterested in having sex with my partner, but the sex we have is getting more and more extreme in order for me to get off.\n\nPerhaps the biggest problem I have is my instincts to want to be dominated by men. As I have covered before I am not gay or bi (trust me I have explored this over and over again), but find myself just craving sex with men over and over. I have gone so far as to cruise for gay sex and even found men to be with, but ultimately backed out. I just dream of being used as a \"sissy\" and I think this is a direct result of sexual trauma.\n\nMy question is do these thoughts ever stop once you enter recovery? Can I find a way that my trauma will no longer dominate me? Will I ever be able to walk through life without obsessing over sex? What is your experience with this?",

They own my life, make me feel terrible when I buy them and after I smoke them. \n\nI'm on to their game and it still doesn't feel better, but I need to do this the hard way so that I don't ease back into it, like every other time in my 20 plus years.

            "selftext": "Long story short; when I was 17 my GP started prescribing me klonopin and ambien. I was on them and abusing them heavily for 6 years. It took me a hydrocodone prescription on top of it all to do some really dumb shit and ended up in prison, full on adult prison for just shy of a year to realize I needed to stay off those meds. \n\nIt was easy. Prison wouldn't allow those types of meds so I had an easy 10 months of sobriety.  I never even thought about going back to my doctor. I'm almost 27 now and today I had a craving like I haven't had for the last 3 years. Ambien was my favorite. I only took it at night in my home but I loved the feeling. Fighting to stay awake while tripping. \nIdk why but I loved it. \n\nYesterday i went in for an upper endoscopy for some stomach related issues. I went it nervous as hell. They got me all set up with the iv and stuff and the doctor comes in and says \" ok I'm giving you the first part of the sedative to help you relax. When it hit me it was like a damn exploding open. I don't know exactly what it was but all I remember thinking was \"holy shit, holy shit I want my ambien back\" and I have a vague thought of going to my doctor claiming sleep issues again. \n\nAfter I left and all that stuff faded out yesterday I felt okay. The desire to run to my doctor long faded and even more so now. After all I went through because of those pills it would take a lot to get me to run back to them. \n\nHonestly it was just a scary thing. I haven't had thoughts about any of my old medication in a long time. having that powerful reminder of what I use to feel scared the shit out of me.",

            "selftext": "** Any advice is greatly appreciated. Just please no harsh words if you think I\u2019m being dumb etc. I may be, but I\u2019m also struggling right now so please keep any negative comments to yourself if you can help it... thank you.**\n\nMy dad has had substance problems for as long as I can remember. (I\u2019m 22 now.) He\u2019s never not been addicted to something. At first it was just alcohol, and now it\u2019s opioids too as well as any other pills he can get his hands on. He steals my mother\u2019s blood pressure meds. She had a stroke last week. I\u2019m almost positive it\u2019s due to her blood pressure spiking and having no meds. She was on pain pills too for rheumatoid arthritis, and as you can imagine she never got any herself. She always tested having none in her system, so they got taken away. He has stolen my medicine (pain pills when I had back surgery and my stimulants I take for narcolepsy). He gets prescription oxycodone (30mg), and he takes them all in like 3 days. I don\u2019t know how he\u2019s alive. Twice he has had seizures from I assume withdrawal (or mixing so many things, I\u2019m unsure) where he stayed unconscious for hours. Somehow doctors didn\u2019t act like they knew the real reason... and this was while I was still trying desperately to keep it a secret so I didn\u2019t dare say anything. Dumb, I know. If he can find it, he also abuses ambien, muscle relaxers, and chugs codeine cough syrup. \n\nMy mom gets upset at the things he does (for example, when I came home because one of our dogs died, he threw a metal flashlight at me and \u201cjokingly\u201d lunged at my throat. Our other dog thought it was real (as did I) and tried to defend me, so he threatened to kill her), but mom always demands I don\u2019t get any outside intervention. However, due to the stroke causing partial paralysis, my mom is at a rehab center. I hate to use this to my advantage, but I feel this is the best opportunity for me to do something. \n\nHe was so fucked up today that he let that same dog get out. Mom freaked out and called me so I called him to make him prove he found her and got her back in house as I really didn\u2019t believe him. (Surprisingly, she was inside). But anyway by the end of the ordeal I literally thought I was having a heart attack. The stims I take for narcolepsy I think must be raising my bp a bit anyway and now it\u2019s easier for freaking out to make my chest hurt. (Plus my dog just died and my mom had a stroke in the same week, so I\u2019m just fragile I guess) \n\nI refuse this anymore. I\u2019m so tired. I\u2019m juggling school (well, was..), two jobs, and helping my mom (I pulled a muscle helping her get to bathroom \u2014 got a muscle relaxer script and just didn\u2019t even get it because I\u2019m afraid one he would steal them and two that I\u2019m prone to addiction too due to him). And on top of that I literally like I said have narcolepsy and also psoriatic arthritis which also causes fatigue so my energy is just wasting away. I had to drop classes this semester because I got so behind. That means I lost financial aid and had to cover rent myself for the rest of the school year. I\u2019m not trying to get pity I\u2019m just trying to properly convey that dealing with his bullshit literally is not an option for me anymore. Without mom home, he\u2019s going ballistic. I\u2019m getting calls from neighbors saying he\u2019s doing this or that, he drunk called our towns sherif and vet telling them they suck basically so I got calls about that.. people who see him nodding off in random places will call me and ask if he\u2019s okay and that I need to come get him.. and I have to explain that I\u2019m 3 hours away at school (still in town working even though I dropped classes \u2014 if I\u2019m paying rent I figured I may as well live in a regular home as long as possible.) and that mom cannot drive now. \n\nI know I\u2019m an adult and I should be able to handle all of this better, but I feel deep down I\u2019m not going to make it if something doesn\u2019t change. Either something medically happens or he does something to me. He\u2019s never punched me or anything but I\u2019ve definitely been scared for my life before. Sometimes he doesn\u2019t recognize me and once he pointed a gun at me asking who the hell I was in his house. \n\nHe says he will kill himself if doctor takes away his pain pill prescription, and he says he will just shoot at cops if anyone tries to come for him. (Sadly, probably true as he\u2019s been arrested for shooting the car of his drug dealer before...) \n\nIf anyone has ANY advice, please please let me know. I\u2019m sorry for writing a whole novel, and I\u2019m sorry if this isn\u2019t even what\u2019s supposed to be asked here, but I am at my wit\u2019s end. \n\nAlso, for context, he has no insurance and we definitely don\u2019t have the money for a rehab place. I\u2019m having to help out for mom\u2019s stroke rehab, so I don\u2019t have the means to contribute. His dad and brother aren\u2019t alive, and his mom doesn\u2019t have enough to help out and their relationship is hot and cold anyway. He isn\u2019t on good terms with any other family, and his lifestyle has led all friends to distance themselves... \n\nAt the end of the day, he\u2019s still my dad. And surprisingly he does have some days where he is good to me, so I don\u2019t want anything bad to happen to him, but this is the second medical issue caused by this (while fighting another time my mom\u2019s heart valve popped a hole and she needed immediate heart surgery...) and as you can imagine I suffered years of emotional abuse from a violent drunk and a looped out dad who went from being asleep for pretty much days at a time to being angry and throwing things. I never knew what each day would hold. I was never allowed to bring people over, and the only places he ever took me were dealers houses. College allowed me enough distance to see how fucked up my life was, and I finally want to make a move. Perhaps the only option is to abandon my hometown altogether, but that seems cruel too. I just don\u2019t know. \n\nIf you made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read such a long post. I\u2019m hoping someone has advice or has been in a similar situation, but even just words of encouragement would be appreciated.",

Now I'm using in my dreams, and even then in the dreams I know what I'm doing is wrong and don't even want to use, so I wake up in a panic and feeling very emotional. I haven't been able to get to a meeting lately so I thought sharing here might help. I have no cravings whatsoever and haven't faced any triggers; has anyone experienced this before? I have no desire at all to use even after having these dreams so I believe it might be my subconscious \"testing me\". I'm in a very happy place in my life right now so these dreams make me sad when I wake up, it's like my addiction is torturing me because I'm happy and not interested in drugs. \n\nIt just goes to show that the monkey on our back will always try to hang on with its claws in us, but I refuse to let it dig any deeper in me, no matter what tactics my addiction might use--I will never let it win again.

            "selftext": "Hello, all,\n\nI've never posted here before and I hope this is the right place to do it. I have a dependency on alcohol and marijuana and have decided to quit drinking on weekdays, and have only smoked once (this past Saturday, in a social situation) in two weeks. I know self-monitoring can be risky, but so far, I have been successful this week. But as of Sunday (the day I began), I have felt sluggish, confused, out-of-sorts, and fatigued. I also have a slight headache.\n\n I can't tell if I'm struggling with sugar withdrawal, alcohol withdrawal, or marijuana withdrawal based on my symptoms. I don't think I eat a lot of sugar, because I am not particularly fond of sweet foods and candies when sober, but last night I had vivid dreams about bakeries and cakes. I used to eat a fair amount of sweets when I had the munchies, but always preferred savory foods. I also tend to favor clear alcohols, like gin and vodka, usually mixed with flavored seltzers, which has low sugar content overall. When I drank other alcohols, I did prefer sweeter ones, like persecco and ros\u00e9 and sour beers.\n\nI just ate about a third of a pomegranate and a few slices of cake, and feel better than I have for the past two days. I wish I had bought more fruit in particular (I'm out of pomegranate) because it made me feel a lot better. I'm just confused, because even with the amount I was eating when smoking weed, I still didn't eat a huge amount of sugar, and I almost always drank clear alcohols, like gin and vodka. Has anyone else experienced this with alcohol? Does anyone have any idea what type of withdrawal I am having, and how best to treat it? I looked up alcohol withdrawal symptoms, and my strongest symptoms are confusion, fatigue, and headache, which seem to be more common with sugar withdrawals rather than alcohol, since other, larger symptoms of alcohol withdrawal are not present. Or are they not present because it has only been three days? Has anyone else been in a similar situation? If so, what happened? Did you manage to treat it, and if you did, how so?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!!!",

I disagree, because I've seen people in worse states (I've obviously never said this to him). Fred drinks a reasonable amount of beer, mostly kills a 12 pack of Natty Ice in two days or so. \n\nRecently, he's decided to quit cold turkey. For many reasons, I'm worried about this. First and foremost, he's doing it completely on his own. No therapy, no groups, no nothing. He also suffers from a crippling social anxiety which makes discussing this with him VERY difficult. \n\nI have a couple questions, as I don't personally consider myself any kind of addict. \n\nFirst off, should I be concerned for his mortality given this cold turkey quitting? Will he be okay?\n\nSecondly, is there anything I can do to help?\n\nFinally, I'm considering telling his family. At worst, I'm considering telling a hospital. I feel like he needs to ween off in a steady and safe environment, and his bedroom is neither of those.\n\nWill he hate me for it if I tell them? Will he eventually forgive me? Should I tell his parents, or intervene otherwise with his isolated attempt?\n\nThank you very much in advance for reading and contributing. I'm very concerned...",

And this one was... well, it really opened my eyes.\n\nGuys, I get the beauty and the fun and the thrill and the fascination and the obsession and the addiction that most of us have with drugs. I get it as much as anyone, trust me. I've spent the past few years honestly probably more often fucked up than I spent sober. I. Get. It.\n\nBut sometimes, and not everyone is ready to hear this or admit it or face it and that's okay, but one day we all (well, most of us here, I'm assuming) need to either get it together or else... what? What's that phrase from AA/NA? We're all destined for either jails, institutions, or death if we continue along this path that is substance abuse/drug addiction? Something like that, but you get my point.\n\nToday is the day I'm finally going to start taking my recovery seriously. Well, I guess tomorrow will be the first day, since I didn't start today off with this mindset (not in the slightest, actually, but I'll get to that later). And as someone who has spent years basically worshipping the ground stims walk on, I can tell you that this time, this time I'm actually serious. I'm ready.\n\nThe whole \"journey\" (if you will) of substance abuse and drug addiction is obviously different for everyone who goes through it, but I can at least generalize a little bit and say that there are different stages in the \"journey.\" I'm sure you have at least a vague idea of what I mean, if you're here. Y'know, the very beginning, when you do your first \"real\" drug, whatever that means to you, and you feel like \"yes, wow, I totally get how people can get addicted to this stuff cause it feels damn good. But, I mean, not me. This is just a one time thing for ***ME***. ***I'M*** strong. ***I*** won't go down the path of a trashy drug-addicted junkie. It's not... ***THAT*** good.\"\n\n...until you come down. Until you don't have it anymore. Until you're shining your phone flashlight into the fucking crevices and seams of your shitty old dirty carpet, searching for just a little something, *anything*.\n\nNow, I'm not a huge fan (as I don't believe anyone really is) of scare tactics and fear mongering and the like, and I'm aware that this post may be giving some people that kinda vibe. And honestly, if you're susceptible to the whole scare tactics thing and reading a bunch of terrifying, graphic posts about painful, excruciating overdoses ending in death is what it takes to get you, personally, to quit... then that's a good thing in my book. If you think that might work, go try it. Hell, even if you don't think it'll work, still: I dare you to google a few case studies of people overdosing on your drug of choice if you've never done it before. I think it's just a part of the aforementioned \"journey\" that all of us here are on.\n\nAnyway, my point is, I'm not trying to make the point of this post just \"drugs are bad. and scary. and they will hurt you and kill you and make ur mom sad when u die.\" Because tbh there are already plenty of those out there on the internet and I don't feel the need to add another just basically repeating the same thing everyone else says.\n\n&gt;**(TL;DR? Kinda?):**\n\nBut, what I ***AM*** trying to say, is that I took about 1/3 of the amount of vyvanse (you can substitute the word \"vyvanse\" here with your particular drug of choice, if it helps at all) I'd typically think to take to get high and just like, get focused and stuff. I didn't need to do any work or write an essay or anything, it was just for fun, like I usually do. I do stims pretty regularly, but not quite daily, if anyone's curious about that aspect of the whole thing. Anyway, I took way less than usual, and a couple hours after dosing (orally), I very suddenly just felt... bad. Pain. Heart beating waywayway too fast, breathing was difficult and I had fluid in my lungs which didn't help, extreme nausea, bloating, and stomach pain, feeling faint, dizziness, and just... panic. Like, if any of you have ever had a near-death experience... you know. You ***KNOW*** that feeling when it's like, \"wow, I am really on the brink of death right now and if I just gave up all my willpower right in this moment I would be gone. Forever. And my mom would cry every night for the rest of my life and my partner would be devastated and omg my grandma...\" You know, the works.\n\nSo, yeah, I felt like... that. And for a few seconds I just waited, to see if it was just like a quick, temporary thing. But no, it kept getting worse so I called my mom and she came and \"babysat\" me if you will as I proceeded to experience all of the symptoms I just listed as well as extreme muscle weakness, fatigue, confusion, amnesia, just like all the bad, near-death sort of symptoms you'd expect to feel if you were about to fucking die. I endured that, unable to do anything at all except make a significant effort just to make myself breathe (or really, wheeze, rather). This whole ordeal started around 2:30pm today, at the latest, if I remember correctly. I only just started feeling better, and it's now 9pm.\n\nHowever, I am grateful. I am grateful for this experience because I was given another chance. Another chance at life and you know what? I'm going to fucking take it and not let myself get that goddamn stupid close to dying ever a-fucking-gain - and yes, that means I'm going to stop abusing drugs. I'm still going to take my prescription medications (antidepressants and suboxone, as prescribed. just not the vyvanse anymore at all, but I talked to my doctor about that and we good). But it's just not worth it to me anymore. The terror I felt for those hours of weakness and pain and fear was honestly just exactly what ***I*** needed in order to convince myself to... to just fucking stop. For good this time. Not half-ass quitting, where you just do it somewhat less often and eventually build back up to right where you were before. But forreal, this time I am so serious. I can do it. I have a good support system. I have the resources. And, now, finally, after way too fucking long, I also have the motivation and willpower to actually fucking follow through.\n\nSo, like, wish me luck, guys. I've really enjoyed being a part of this community, but I genuinely hope you understand when I say that I hope I never fucking come back here (except to read and respond to any comments or messages, of course \u263a\ufe0e). Sorry for the giant wall of text, forgive me, but I'm not asking anyone to read this entire thing. It's for me. To come back to later if I need it. The only reason I'm actually posting it is because who knows, maybe, just maybe someone will benefit from it. And that makes it all worthwhile. Love you guys. I genuinely hope the best for each and every one of you here. &lt;3",

She hasn\u2019t been doing well (sleeping all day and up all night, suicidal) so she asked me to take my two nephews until she could get her life sorted. \n\nWell a couple days ago she tells me she\u2019s been doing cocaine but now using crack because \u201cher nose needs a break\u201d. I\u2019m starting to truly worry that this is going to become a serious issue. I mean obviously it already is but I\u2019m concerned she\u2019s going to have a difficult time quitting. \n\nShe says she\u2019s going to quit in 3 weeks while she goes out east to visit our family. Is this something the average person can do? Just go on holiday and quit cold turkey? She thinks being there will replace the crack adrenaline with adrenaline from being happy to see our family. \n\nRight now she says she spends about $200-$300 a day on crack/cocaine. When she crashes she sleeps for days and doesn\u2019t eat for days. Today she came over for dinner and to visit the kids and she went to do a line of coke outside. It was obvious she couldn\u2019t even spend an hour with the children without needing it. I\u2019ve never seen her so distant from them emotionally. \n\nI\u2019m very concerned as it not only is affecting just her but the children are the biggest focus. I want her to get clean and have them reunited. I tried suggesting addictions programs, drop in meetings, counselling etc but she has said she enjoys it right now.\n\nIs there anything I can do? Anything I should do to make it easier on my nephews? I feel very frustrated and exhausted by this and lost.",

She\u2019s now over a month clean, healthy and herself. \n\nI want to be as supportive as I can without being over bearing and cause triggers or relapse. I plan on calling her once a week or every other week. And try to visit at least once a month or every other month. Money is a little tight and she knows. \n\nWhen I go up, I want to bring some book, and maybe a journal so she can write her feelings in it or whatever it may be, and a shit load of snacks and treats. I\u2019ll have to call them beforehand of course to see what I can and cannot bring just so it doesn\u2019t get confiscated.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve offered her a place in my home for her to get a fresh new start. \n\nMy question to those whose been to rehab, regarding outside support, what helped you get through it? \n\nAnd for those who have/had friends or family member in rehab, what did or do you do to show your support?\n\nAny feedback is appreciated.

            "selftext": "So, I've been taking, on average, 2MG of kilonopin for the past 3 or so years. They are prescribed; however, I have an addictive personality and simply started taking them daily. Two 1MG tablets each morning. It may not sound like a lot for some but I'm definitely physically and psychologically addicted. I've realized that I can't function without them and it has affected many things in my life. Anyway, it is time to stop.\n\nI am aware that going \"cold turkey\" can be dangerous. I plan to taper off to about a half a tablet by this coming Saturday or Sunday. Today is Thursday, April 30th. I have taken vacation for next week so that while I go through withdrawal it will not affect work.\n\nAbout 2 years ago I did this and remember the few days of withdrawal vividly. I was sweating profusely, experienced insomnia, and had significant sensations like an electric shock running through my nerves that would cause an arm or leg to \"jump\" or occasionally it would cause my whole body to \"jump\".\n\nSoooooo, I'm going to taper down over the next 5 days. I'm well aware the next week will suck but it is just something I have to do. I've done it before, I know i can do it again. I've had problems with alcohol in the past so I am definitely going to make a routine of hitting AA meetings once the significant withdrawal symptoms have subsided. I know I'll need a support system. \n\nI'll update if any of you happen to read this. I'll definitely be using a number of subs on reddit when my mind won't go to sleep, I feel the cravings, etc.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated from those who have been there. I sense this will be a more extreme withdrawal experience for me. Nobody in my life knows I have this dependency so I'll be on here for support etc. I'm not asking for support from you fine folks, I'll just keep on reading threads to confirm my decision when my mind is telling me otherwise. \n\nThat's all for today. It feels good to put this in writing. It is a form of noting my decision instead of it being a fleeting thought I suppose. \n\nHave a wonderful day / week etc all.\n\nI don't post on reddit much but I'll cross post this to one other specific sub simply so I can get additional feedback. I don't know what the mods will do about it but I'll surely find out.\n\nIf you have made it this far, thank you very much for reading!",

            "selftext": "Not sure how to even start a message like this so, I will just be quick and too the point.\n\nMy mother-in-law(71yrs old) was prescribed way too many benzos and Tramadol. Her primary care was prescribing her klonopin 1mg 3x per day and Lunesta 2mg before bed. She also went to a pain clinic who prescribed her 200mg Tramadol 3x per day and 1mg Xanax 3x per day.\n\nAs someone who has dealt with depression and anxiety in the past, I am more than aware how high of doses these are when combined. I confronted both of her Drs (with my wife) and they were, somehow, unaware of the other writing the scripts. Sounds crazy to me... You'd think the pharmacy would have said something but, what ever.\n\nWhere we are at right now is, she's addicted. badly, of course. She was on this concoction for about 7 months. Once her tolerance built and neither Dr would up her dose, she turned to alcohol. This is when *certain things* took place and we were made aware of true nature of the situation and intervened. \n\nWe have worked with both Drs and it didn't turn out too pretty. Her primary basically dropped her as a patient. He pushed her off to one of the other Drs and the pain clinic has basically done the same.... I understand these choices as she was certainly in the wrong and neither Dr want to continue feeding her addiction and they have no trust relationship any longer. \n\nHowever, we are stuck trying to figure out how to get her treatment. Her insurance does not cover any of the treatment centers around. We looked into charities and places like alcohol anonymous and there are some folks who will talk to her and be someone to lean on. However, none can give her a full detox program. \n\nWorst of all, her new Dr kicked her down to .5mg of xanax 3x a day and nothing else. No tapering or anything. So, she is currently dealing with withdrawals from Lunesta, Tramadol, AND benzos. She snuck out of the house and walked almost 4 miles just to get beer at a gas station last night. She's doing this at 71 years old.. It is bad and not something we are capable of dealing with. We have 2 young children and she is out of control (She currently staying with us because of these issues)... But, this is my wife's mom. We can't just kick her out and let her die from these withdrawals (benzo withdrawals are nasty and I am seeming the first hand).\n\nI guess my question is simple. Since we are not rich and can't afford the $3,000 45 day detox programs of the places around, what are our options? Can we just take her to the ER and have them detox her? (I know they will stabilize her but, I am not sure if they will actually give her the care she needs or just send her home after they load her up enough to stop the withdrawals).. My wife and I have never dealt with anything like that and are really lost.",

I have beaten alcohol addiction (4 years sober July 6th) but it was because I truly wanted to.\n\nI have no idea how to quit smoking weed when I don't really want to. I have my own money I usually spend on it so it's not a matter of someone not letting me... also I suffer from an array of mental health problems and my psychiatrist says I qualify for a medical marijuana card.

            "selftext": "I'm worried that my friend is going to die. He's had interventions in the past. He is highly pessimistic about programs. He does not have the money to go to a treatment center. He has historically been using some pretty hard substances off and on (the worst of it was heroin, which he is clean from going on a couple of years. Adderall and alcohol are the issue now). \n\nI have sort of a small favor to ask, if anyone would be willing to help me out. I'd like to compile and share some anonymous addiction/recovery stories with him. I'm going to start mailing them to him with no return address. He doesn\u2019t really know what\u2019s out there in terms of resources/feels like he doesn\u2019t really have anyone to relate to/is dealing with some serious mental health issues on top of it all. Obviously, I don\u2019t expect that your situation and his situation should be at all alike, but I think he could really benefit from hearing some totally anonymous peoples' stories right now. Something about that sense that someone he\u2019ll likely never even meet was willing to take a second out of their day to share something relatable from their life. \n\nHe\u2019s worked hard to get clean in the past but he is seriously lacking the motivation and self-confidence-- doesn\u2019t feel like he\u2019s worthy of sobriety or even fundamental happiness, etc. His parents were drug addicted when he was younger, and were pretty abusive in a whole host of ways. His relative moments of clarity are fewer and further between. If you'd like to contribute anything, message me or feel free to post below. I'll take it all into account. Thank you, in advance, for your kindness--",

I was away at school and experienced a lot of trauma in a very short amount of time, so after the school year, I went home to get my shit together. Well cut to a year later and I'm still here, working, and spending all the money I make on weed. I've had weed in my system pretty much non stop for months, I've become reclusive and rarely hang out with friends anymore. My space is always a mess, and the constant smoking makes it easier for me to end up eating like shit and feeling even worse. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n The thing is, I\u2019m very much against the \u201cweed is evil\u201d mentality, as I think it can be extremely helpful to people with all sorts of ailments. I've always had a lot of great experience with it, both with friends, going on adventures and laughing, and being alone, feeling creative and inspired. Because there have been positives in it for me, and because it's not as cut and dry/objectively bad for you, like heroin or meth, it's really hard for me to know how to feel/what to do. I can see that it's only prolonged things, and helped me avoid facing my reality and taking steps for my future. But it's become so ingrained within me and such a habit, and because it's something that is so common now, I don't think anyone would understand being addicted to it. I want things to change. I'm not content and there is a lot I want to accomplish. But I feel helpless at this point. Also, the idea that once you\u2019re an addict, you\u2019re always an addict, really scares me. I'm just feeling lost. any feedback would be greatly appreciated. thank you",

I\u2019m talking only 3 light meals a day if you would even call them meals.  \nIn the AM before school i\u2019d eat 2 eggs \nAt lunch i\u2019d drink a protein shake and granola bar\nAnd at dinner i\u2019d eat a tuna sandwich and that was it for a few months. \nI lost like 80 pounds in like 4-5 months and didn\u2019t gain much for awhile. I\u2019d also like to add that i was working out for like 2 hours everyday at my local gym (Usually biked from my house to the gym) \nI started smoking weed everday a few months later and gained a little weight back due to the munchies and kinda stayed stagnant at a certain weight. Fast forward about 2 years to today i\u2019ve been trying to lose weight again and get back to where i was when i lost 80 pounds. Now i\u2019m not as big as i was when i first started but i don\u2019t want to get close. \nThere\u2019s times when i stop eating for a few days and basically starve myself to try and lose weight and it usually works. That\u2019s until i start eating again. \n\nNowadays it\u2019s been a problem. \nI work overnight shifts and once i get out of work i\u2019m usually hungry as hell. I go home and BINGE on all types of snacks (Bowl of cereal, Goldfish, Candy, pretzels) and then fall asleep after. It\u2019s like a drug addiction because i get bad cravings for junk food randomly throughout the day. \nToday for instance i decided i wanted to stop eating bad shit and eat healthier. I woke up after binge eating last night and only had 2 bananas and an apple throughout the entire day and once i got home i Binged on a bag of chips and ice cream cake. Idk why i justify it to be OK and start eating bad again. I hate it so much but i don\u2019t think i can stop. \n\nDoes anyone relate to this by any chance and have any tips on how to stop and switch my mindset for the better? I hate starving myself because i always end up eating bad  at some point and Gain it all back. It\u2019s been like this for awhile",

            "selftext": "When my boyfriend and I first started talking and thinking about getting into a relationship, he was fully addicted to coke, going out every night and using. His best friend at the time was a big drug dealer so he was getting it for free. After a few months of a lot of tears he finally became sober, and he changed a lot.  But his brother was in the system and he would talk to me about how he\u2019s afraid when he gets out because he knows he can\u2019t say no to him and he doesn\u2019t want to get addicted again. Well, that came true. My boyfriend and I were having lots of issues and things weren\u2019t working out, so we broke up for about two weeks, I texted him one night and he told me he just bought coke and was in the middle of doing lines, I still got back together with him thinking he would want to become sober again, and I was wrong. Ever since it\u2019s been a constant back and forth of me not wanting him to do it to him not understanding why I\u2019m so against it. He tells me he\u2019s not going to let it get out of control, but I feel like it already is. So with that there\u2019s been a lot of fighting and I felt hopeless so I gave him an ultimatum, it\u2019s me or cocaine. But it didn\u2019t last because I was so afraid that he was going to choose coke over me. He\u2019s not going out every night and using like he was but he\u2019s definitely turning back into the addict that I know isn\u2019t him. Last night we got into a huge fight because his brother wanted him to go out and get coke and stay up all night with their friends when he has drug treatment counseling today. He told me that he didn\u2019t really want to go out either but I personally would have to bring it up to his brother about it. So, I did, and his brother said that he\u2019s not going to argue with be but this isn\u2019t what \u201cthey want\u201d. So I asked him what did his brother mean by that and he said that he doesn\u2019t like me telling him what to do. I got livid over that because he\u2019s the one who told me he didn\u2019t want to go out but since he can\u2019t say no to his brother I did it for him and then he gets mad at me about it. I guess I\u2019m hurt that he doesn\u2019t know why his addiction effects me. And I\u2019d really appreciate some feedback or someone to talk to about it because I just don\u2019t know what to do. I just want my baby back.",

            "selftext": "We have been together for a year, and we live together. He is usually kind, considerate and treats me very well (although he is not thoughtful or romantic, but he does look after me e.g. cooking, cleaning, making me cups of tea etc). A couple of months ago I would have happily married him; we were like best friends as well as lovers and he was supportive and made me laugh (or this used to be the case). \n\nHe used to smoke copious amounts of cannabis very regularly before we got together, and a few years ago developed cannabinoid hyperemesis. (Google this if you are unsure what it means - he was hospitalised several times and had severe kidney problems, and lost several stone). It took him a couple of years of being ill on/off before he realised that the weed caused it. \n\nHe didnt smoke it at all almost when we got together. It was a very casual thing, perhaps once a month or so (not enough to make him ill), and he gave it up completely for around 3 months from Sept-Jan. I did not smoke any cannabis for around 7 years prior to this. \n\nThen, after my SO stated that he would enjoy it if I got stoned with him once, I had some (around Feb time). He then developed the taste for it again. He has started smoking it almost every day, and his personality has changed. He is acting as though he doesn't care about anything except getting stoned again. \n\nI spoke to him numerous times, begged him to cut down, explained I was becoming unhappy and I was worried he would get ill again, and that I could see his mental health declining. He promised multiple times to cut down, then actually needed up taking time off work with sickness and using the time to get stoned. \n\nUntil today - when things got much worse. He is ill again with Cannabinoid Hyperemesis, and we both havent slept all night because of it (being sick/heaving up bile every 20 minutes and constantly having to get in the bath). \n\nHe has done this to himself and I have no sympathy, but it is hurting me to see that he has done this to himself too. It is horrible to see someone you care about retching their guts up all night and shivering constantly. \n\nBut guess what? He just came downstairs at 5am and ROLLED HIMSELF A JOINT!\n\nI must admit, I got so angry about this, and threw his grinder into the pebbles in the back yard. I couldn't believe how ridiculously stupid he had been! (The only thing that stops the illness is cutting out weed) \n\nI'm afraid he will lose his job because of this - he already took 2 weeks off to get stoned and now he is too ill to go back to work on Tuesday. \n\nTalking to him any more about it at this point seems futile. \n\nTl;dr- Boyfriend has made himself ill (cannabinoids hyperemesis) by smoking weed again after quitting. Has completely changed. Has ignored my pleas for him to stop and is now very ill again. The relationship has suffered because of this. He knows it is the weed making him ill and still he is smoking it.",

Also, my partner and I are planning on trying for a baby next month :) I have already been to my doctor to take some blood tests and everything seems ok except minor lack in vitamin (makes sense when I was eating maybe 1 meal a day for a long time, even less..). \n\nNext step for me is to stop drinking altogether. I've not quit because I knew that it would be too much for me to handle but I feel ready now and want to prepare my body for what's to come.  \nMy life has turned around and I can not thank this sub enough. I've tried so many different things before to get me motivated to stop destroying myself and those who love me. \n\nTHIS. This is what made me take the first step.

Honestly a part of me is like eh, just do it for your b-day and be done with it. It will be 45 days sober by the time my bday comes around and this is all so new.

For most it sounds banal but I struggle with caffeine (uppers) addiction. \n\nI\u2019ve no problem cutting all stims, I\u2019ve quit weed and tabac in the past years.\n\nI know my stuff when it comes to quitting. \n\nGotta fill the void with something positive and maintain a positive and healthy lifestyle etc. I\u2019ve used a lot of drugs but the best time I had in my life was when i was sober, working, eating healthy, working out, it was the best feeling ever, that natural energy that you feel when you are in balance with yourself and shit, cant have that with drugs. or at least is doesnt feel authentic.\n\nAnyway, there is one drug, and if you dont see it as a drug then you are ignorant, i simply cannot quit, its caffeine. I am not the same when i drink coffee, is just a roboterish duplicate of me, after all, its a stimulant. In my eyes its the one drug that keeps the world running but also a hideous one, because its so subtle and so innocent. I believe most of the problems in the world come from drugs and people not beeing sober, not themselves. \n\nI want to quit. But its simply everywhere. On every corner you can buy a quick espresso shot. My favorite drink is filled with it and its so fucking delicious even when I go one day without it i keep buying it the next day becaus its so freaking good. Usually I overdose everyday of caffeine, often i drink so much till i cannot sleep half the night. Once i start drinking i could drink all day fucking coffee. Same with all other drugs. But those i can handle. I quit everything. but this fucking rush. its so good. i hate myself for not getting over it. it changes me, when i drink caffeine i am not me anymore, i am colder to my wife, my sentiments are weak, my hands are not sensitive anymore, my touch feels not sensitive. i am there but i am not there.\n\ni want this to end and have my sober mind back ffs",

But there are a handful of people who were ride or die... people I had strong deep connections with... people I cared about deeply and would even go as far as saying that I loved some of them.

Some of the darkest times... some of the best times... some of the most embarrassing times... and they never turned their backs on me or me on them. \nUntil I got clean.\nI knew I couldn't be around these people and stay clean. \nAnd having to stop communicating with them absolutely broke me. I knew it was for the best for my own sobriety... and the most of them understand that and support me. \nBut it still hurts. \nI still miss them.\nI still love them.\nAnd i still can't help but feeling like I've betrayed them by focusing on myself. \nThese are people who were there for me at my darkest times... and now that I'm doing my best to live my best life they're not apart of it and I hate it... because i wish they could get sober and live it with me. But they're not ready. It's my hope that someday they'll come around but until then in order to stay sober I've had to force myself to cut them out. \nI know its what's best for me... but will this guilt and loneliness ever go away?

            "selftext": "Hello redittors, this is my first post here on reditt and am writing this after going through countless posts and not finding what i wanted :(\nI am a 22yr old male studying engineering(mech), i was under the illusion that i was a smart student, my family members used to tell my cousins who scored low to study like me..whereas i clearly didnt study anything and things happend that i could grasp the subject easily,  i have started bunking, riding to different places in search of adventures, i smoke a lot of pot, have tried some Acid, M and X and the only thing am addicted to is pot, the past 4 years of my graduation life have gone like nothing happend..i do not have any real skills nor do i have good grades (5.8/10), and because of all this, college i had to repeat a year during my first year after which i cleared all those backlogs and currently am in 3rd year with 9 backlogs. If i continue like this, am sure ill have to repeat my third year once more. I have lost total control over my life.. i neither care about parents or myself and these years have taken a huge toll on me, so much that when i see back, all i see is the old self that was energetic, studious and well disciplined. I have no problems regarding money, family or any as such. I need some advice from my fellow friends here who might have gone through a phase like mine.\n  PS: not a native english speaker hence please excuse me for mistakes.",

But my concern is when speaking to him now he\u2019ll refer back to saying some of the things he thought while he was heavily using. Even though everything he thought is untrue. He stopped using kinda cold turkey as he got locked up because of an altercation with his parents. He has no health insurance and hasn\u2019t seeked any help for the same reason. I get the current mood swings as he goes from extremely happy to sad to extremely agitated. Any help and advice of how I could help him try and overcome this a bit more.

There\u2019s no residue on it.\n\nGiven that I know next to nothing about drugs and his drug of choice has always been cocaine Im  not sure what to make of this.\n\nDo you know any drugs (esp stimulants) that may be stored/sold in balloons or am I reading too much into this?",

It takes will and courage to yet through it and it's hard to do alone. When I was looking for help I looked to reddit and someone responded and said \" you don't know when you hit rock bottom man, you just have to stop and start looking up.\" 6 months later I was sober. It's been three years now and I haven't taken a single pill. I still have my vices. But I'm no longer diggin a hole. I stop, rest, enjoy the moment and continue to climb up.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\"I was at the bottom. But I just didn't realize it. It wasn't almost completely dark and I hard time finding my way. I had enough light to crawl towards. I made my way out. Slowly. If I moved too fast I would slip. If I moved too slow I would stop and crawl back down. But I kept trying. Determined to find the right place. And I found it. I'm not completely there but I am at a good resting place. Enjoy where I'm at. I came a long way and I'm proud of that. Sometimes I get tired here and question whether or not I should just move forward or climb back down. I cant go back down I've worked too hard to get to this point, I have to move forward. I will move forward. One step at a time.\"",

I\u2019ve been on massive doses of opiates, from heroin to being brought to a hospital, blue, because of a 980mg/day methadone habit. The gentleman got shut down, FYI   IAC.\n\nI had a relapse, I was clean for 7 years. I\u2019ve been in and out of detox 6 times in less than a year. I can\u2019t hit that 30 day mark. I\u2019ve never had problems stringing a year before. Is addiction really that much harder the older and more you\u2019ve used?\n\nQuestion: I figure at this point the things I\u2019m doing clearly are t working. I\u2019m in my \u201cinsanity\u201d phase. I decided I would go out of the US, to Thailand, to \u201clock\u201d myself up in a \u201ccomfortable\u201d prison. The obvious things like: \u201cYou could leave and go get heroin easily in Thailand\u201d aside. If I have my doctor write me a 1 week subutex taper, and get on a plane , I feel like my chances after 30days would be much higher. I\u2019m currently on Kratom and was on a massive 150-200 pill a day Kratom binge a few weeks ago. \n\n(The Cabin and DARA were the two places. I\u2019m not sure what country outside of the US has equal or superior care?)\n\nThoughts? \n\nAlso if anyone knows: What is the best Detox and or Rehab (money not being a factor, or geological location) you\u2019ve ever heard of? Success rate / level of care type deal. I\u2019m not the type of person to lock myself up in a Buddhist monastery puking for days. (As far as success rates... it\u2019s the highest I\u2019ve heard of, however there would be no care for some ADHD+Bi Polar+High function autism issues).\n\nAppreciate anyone who has read this far. \nHave a wonderful day!",

            "selftext": "Today is the first hard day of my sobriety,\n\n\nI was your typical weekend warrior - cocaine, alcohol and in the end, research chemicals. I have a good career that uses a lot of my efforts to maintain and nourish... to grow I needed the mental clarity that my addiction kept me from. Today, I am 2 months sober, and in that time I have really begun to succeed at my job - the money is coming in, my confidence is at an all time high, my loving girlfriend is by my side... but, alas.. today is a hard day. There are multiple tools I was using to keep myself from falling back into the same hazardous rhythms my life was cycling around in.. the number 1 tool was anger.. anger at myself, anger at life, anger at wasted time, money and health. I have been skeptical about having that as such a strong resource for my sobriety, because I know I couldn\u2019t and can\u2019t keep that feeling up. It would and will run dry. My second resource for sobriety was my career.. which again, I was cautious about. What about those days I just won\u2019t care? What about those Friday nights after a tough week trying to prove to everyone you can do your job better than even you thought you could? My third resource for my sobriety has been the love and connection with my beautiful partner. She\u2019s caring and kind, but stern and jaded when it comes to my degenerate and hedonistic behaviours. I don\u2019t blame her - the lies must have hurt. It\u2019s not only myself that can feel the changes sobriety has given to me, but her as well. The laughter, the goofing around -  the energy. I am alive. We are alive. Writing this, I reflect on all the joys and positivity my severance upon my chemical captors has given me.. so I ask myself \u201cwhy is today such a hard day?\u201d. I have very little answers.. all I can hope for is that I make the right decision for the longevity of my happiness and what little time I have on this earth.",

            "selftext": "The FDA recently approved a nasal-spray form of Ketamine under the  condition that it be used only in clinics.  The supposed reason: there  is a small possibility that a user could become addicted to the spray.  \n \n\nThis, however, is sheer hypocrisy on the part of the FDA.  As I type  this, tens of millions of Americans are addicted to SSRIs, which the FDA  allows them to take at home like they were so much candy. Of course,  one could quibble and say that the SSRIs cause \"chemical dependency\"  rather than addiction but the result for the end user is the same: the  daily need for the drug in question. Far from despising chemical  dependency, however, the FDA actually requires it for those who wish to  use Spravato.  Those of us who are not long-term users of SSRIs are not  even allowed to use the nasal spray.  \n \n\nThis begs the question: what is the FDA's REAL motive in refusing to  allow for the home use of Spravato? Why will they allow us to almost OD  on SSRIs at home yet take not so much as a sniff of Spravato while  there?  If there is any substantive reason for this hypocrisy (apart  from the financial interests of Big Pharma), it can only be that the FDA  has a puritan dislike for patients experiencing true relief at home.   In other words, they share the Drug Warriors aversion to folks getting  \u201chigh\u201d (which, according to the dour theology of the Drug Warrior, is  the pejorative term par excellence) and so they want to \u201cscientize\u201d this  unseemly process to the extent possible by surrounding it by lab coats  and white walls \u2013 thereby requiring \u201cpatients\u201d to \u201cget happy\u201d in an  environment totally unsuited for that purpose: namely, a cheerless  mental health clinic, under the watchful but superfluous eye of a  materialist psychiatrist.",

I relapsed 2 months ago. I am so disappointed in myself. I failed my drug test so my PO violated me and judge just issued a warrant. So I have just thrown everything that I was blessed to be able to get back plus extra. Wtf is wrong with me? I have a great job and Brand New jeep and am loving living by myself. So why would I do this? I thought it was to long to relapse and let my guard down maybe... IDK",

Because this takes place at an unconscious level of processing, we have zero control over the way our brains interpret and prioritize these experiences. For some reason, certain people\u2019s brains are more inclined to form false associations in this part of the brain between particular drugs and the goal of survival. When these people take these drugs(whether medicinally, recreationally or otherwise), their brains tag these experiences with an elevated survival value even though the drugs are not vital.    \nRationality and choice take place in a more recently-evolved part of the brain which can function effectively *only* when receiving accurate information from lower levels of processing. In the case of the addict, his choice over drugs is confounded by the reward circuit\u2019s insistence that the drug is needed for survival. Because this signal is unconscious, he doesn\u2019t actually perceive the drug as being vital to life - but he does experience the result of this association: an elusive, unyielding compulsion to seek out and use the drug, despite his better intentions and judgement.    \nHe is without choice.",

So I had helped this person a few a days prior when they made a post saying they were suffering xanax withdrawals from 4 days of use.\n\nAnyway I knew it's not likely that short peroid of use would make anyone withdraw also her symptoms she was listing weren't consistent with benzo withdraws.\n\nI was the only person that said, \"Doesn't sound like withdrawals to me, you're just getting manic. Go see a doc and get Seroquel.\"\n\nMan, everyone hopped on my case, saying that she's withdrawing and I don't know what I'm talking about. Anyway I moved on forgot about it.\n\nThen yesterday I was scrolling back through posts I've replied to because sometimes I say funny shit. Then when I got back to that one, for some reason checked the profile of that person.\n\nThey had made a post 3 days earlier talking about her 30mg in 4 days. I read through the whole thing and saw right through it all. This post had no replies though, she made the fake withdraw story because no one paid any attention to her first post. So I made a reply to the one no one responded to in hopes to reach out. Enjoy! [the save](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/bf3kuq/sometimes_life_gets_fucked_up_so_i_took_30mg_of/)",

Because this takes place at an unconscious level of processing, we have zero control over the way our brains interpret and prioritize these experiences. For some reason, certain people\u2019s brains are more inclined to form false associations in this part of the brain between particular drugs and the goal of survival. When these people take these drugs(whether medicinally, recreationally or otherwise), their brains tag these experiences with an elevated survival value even though the drugs are not vital.    \nRationality and choice take place in a more recently-evolved part of the brain which can function effectively *only* when receiving accurate information from lower levels of processing. In the case of the addict, his choice over drugs is confounded by the reward circuit\u2019s insistence that the drug is needed for survival. Because this signal is unconscious, he doesn\u2019t actually perceive the drug as being vital to life - but he does experience the result of this association: an elusive, unyielding compulsion to seek out and use the drug, despite his better intentions and judgement.    \nHe is without choice.",

            "selftext": " Hey everyone, \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I have been struggling with some illnesses this past year or so and also had some difficult family times. A couple of months ago when I was at rock bottom I was doing cocaine almost daily. Just staying up all night on my own doing lines, meaningless shit. In addition to this, now every time I go out to drink I get an extremely strong urge to buy coke. Usually results in me buying it as well, almost always to be honest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am fully aware that these are early signs of cocaine addiction and that turning to it during tough times is a bad BAD idea. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's extremely difficult for me, because I have been struggling with this illness for like a year now, the only time I really tend to feel better is when I'm on drugs, especially coke. I do not want to get addicted! Luckily during that bad phase, I ran out of money (student here) and just accepted I would have to go without. If I had the money though, I would have kept on blowing it on gear and likely be in a much worse position than Im in now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, I have refused to go out for the past 3 months (in drinking/party environments) to avoid getting on it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to post this somewhere and maybe get some advice, wise words or guidance from people that are in recovery. As previously mentioned, it's difficult as I used to use exercise to keep myself on a positive track and keep balance in my life, but for now at least and the foreseeable future, exercise is not an option. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I said I do not want to become a drug addict (who does lol) so yeah please get in touch, any words I would appreciate. Unless you call me a dickhead for no reason, that I wouldn't appreciate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance guys :)",
