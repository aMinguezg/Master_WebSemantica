I have two or three drinks on light days and ten to fifteen on heavy days.  It's not the worst I've ever seen but it's still a real problem if it keeps going like this. \n\nSo, now I'm trying to put my money where my mouth is and start. I'm two days sober now. Not impressive, I know.  \n\nNow to my real question:\n I like kombucha, and fizzy beverages in general, but I'm also fat and don't need any needless calories.  So for the past few days it's been strictly seltzer.  I'm wondering about the idea of still drinking kombucha.  The probiotics, the flavor, the fizz are all attractive to me but I also know it's the tiny alcoholic in my head saying \"a little won't kill you.\" \n\nLooking for any advice from people like me who thought their problem \"wasn't that bad.\"",

Hold a steady job, for all intents and purposes I am getting by, but I am a full on alcoholic trying to get the nerve to quit and believe I may be having physical symptoms. I spoke w/ my doctor about them and all he could really say was, \"it's possible...you need to stop.\" I have been drinking about a pint of vodka plus a beer or two every night for the last 4-5 years. I may skip one night once every two or three weeks but in general, it is every night. I am fully aware this is terrible for me, I'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced why I am lately...Pain and weakness in my legs. It's pretty bad. For example, if I bend at the knees, only a few inches, my legs begin trembling and shaking. They also seem to be getting weaker, sore and tiring out very easy. Again, I know I need to quit and I am not asking for medical advice, I'm just simply wondering if anyone else experienced anything like this. I know people who have drank like this (family members) for ten years and it didn't happen to them. It's just hard for me to believe that could be the cause of it. Thanks for your time in advance.",

            "selftext": "I hope this is okay to post here.\n\nMy partner and his family have really been struggling for the past year.  Maybe longer, but that's how long I've been aware of it.  A yearish ago his dad was forced to retire early due to a dui he didn't want to report to work.  He literally lost his job due to his drinking.  Since then there's been many other 'incidents' as I'll call them.  I'm sure many of you can relate to the living on edge.  You never know what's going to happen or when.  Always stressed and wondering what he's up to, that kind of thing.\n\nIt's really hard from my perspective looking into the situation because I'm not you know.... directly in there.  I'm not one of the kids and I'm not his wife, we're not married yet.  So it's hard for me to really have any input in what to do about it or anything.  And he's an adult so like, as my partner says, we can't force him to get help or do anything.  True.  But their family, as I've pointed out to my partner, is really not very good at communication.  Even in best of times their communication style is just very superficial.  They never really get emotional or open up about stuff.  I feel like for the past year no one has really been direct with the dad about how this is MAJORLY affecting any of them; dropped any hammers or said hey, there's this huge elephant in the room..... can we talk about this please??????  \n\nThere's sooooo much whispering, texting, worrying, phone calls, canceling plans to babysit him, hoping he'll cancel his own plans (he has a two month solo trip coming up that everyone is really worried about), a family wedding coming up that everyone's stressed about, just so so much on the horizon and like..... I am sitting here in my point of view feeling just as anxious feeling like not enough is being said.  I know it might not necessarily accomplish much more than is already happening and it still might not lead him to getting help, but isn't it worth doing?  \n\nMy partner really insists from his position that taking it one day at a time is what he needs to do, and that alcholism is a disease (and I do know that and I'm glad he keeps reminding me bc it's really easy for me to keep being so angry about this and everything) but at the same time I'm chronically ill and I just feel like damn, I'm getting help for my illnesses and I wish I could easily more or less quit having my health problems and when someone gets lung cancer people don't just let them keep smoking and not go to chemo...... I'm so sorry this is probably so insensitive :( \n\nI just really needed to talk to someone and I feel like my partner and his family don't want to hear it and I need an outlet and I'm just as stressed as they are and I'm needing to be open and talk about it and they aren't doing that...... can someone help me with this?  What can I do to help and also to help my mindset?  I want to help the situation, my partner and my own stress and anxiety.  It's been a really stressful year and this is not close to a resolution.  I know this takes a long time.  I just want to help.  My partner and I also both have really stressful jobs so that probably doesn't help :( \n\nThanks so much for reading this!!! I really appreciate it &lt;3",

            "selftext": "My Name is Emilia, I am soon turning 15, and live in Germany. My Mother is an Alcoholic, and I do not know what to do anymore.\n\nMy parents divorced end of 2016.\nBack then, my Dad used to drink, but he stopped by himself which to this day I am extremely proud of. After they divorced, I moved to my dads new place since stuff had been happening and I believed him more. In one conversation we had, he revealed that both of them had been smoking cannabis for a long time. I was shocked, but assured him I would be fine. About a year later, My mom had fallen off a stool while watering a hanging plant, and broke her wrist. She had to go to hospital to get surgery and I stayed at my dads for that time. Naturally, We hadnt been to my moms place until she got back. When she opened her mail from the last few days it was revealed i had a serious autoimmune illness that required me to go to hospital for 2 weeks and take medication (still to this day.) While my stay there, my dad found out she had been drinking. She had also had sexdates (he said she told him it even happened on MY bed once.) I was furious, worried and disappointed. It got to a point where her sexdates would want to try and get in contact with me. I admit, in the past my dad, being drunk, put up cameras around our place for other men i didnt know to see us whenever they wanted. I am kinda scared he still does that. Cut to now - we have help that runs out in july. We moved, prentend things are fine but she is still drinking. I also saw her texting with someone she'd told me she broke contact with because he stalked us. I dont know that to do anymore and it affects my health and grades greatly.",

By himself or with me, he just goes to the odd craft beer place, it's his biggest hobby and within limits I can deal with that. But once he goes over a certain level, he won't stop without turning very, very defensive and disrespectful.\n\nKnowing that he's loves being compared to his father who's a pretty bad, but funny alcoholic (means everyone loves him regardless and alcoholism is suddenly not perceived as that bad), that worries also me. His tendencies of never knowing when to stop once he started properly aren't great, either.\n\nHe just started at a new place and there's a group of early 20s lads who like to go on the beers every Friday. I know that's my boyfriend's (30) downfall. He has an important class every Saturday 10am, so he can't get too drunk on Fridays. Yet here we are.\n\n6pm: Just had two or three beers, will be home soon.\n\n7pm: Yeah, sorry, they are so funny, can't go yet.\n\n8pm: On my way to the bus\n\n9pm: Don't know when I'm coming home (first drunken video calls to him and his new mates)\n\n10pm: Don't wait for meeee (argument on the phone, I get in the car to pick him up)\n\n10:30pm: Arrive, refuses to leave building\n\n11pm: Successfully transport him under protest to the car with help of lads, nice guys, they are not even drunk really, he's basically unconscious at this stage\n\n11:30pm: Arrive home, he barely makes his way to the house before the puking starts\n\n12am: I undress him, shower him, brush his teeth, all while being puked at constantly, and tug him into our bed\n\n12:30am: Listening to his snoring. Hoping these lads will stay away, not because it's their fault, but because they saw what state he's in and that he's not good to be drunkenly around. Wishful thinking.

            "selftext": "I had a friend I was very close with who was an alcoholic. Drinking at work, not coming home from the bar at night and crashing at a stranger's place, almost ending the relationship with the love of his life. He cut me off completely last fall and basically told me that I'm dead to him. His partner and I are good friends and she wasn't \"allowed\" to have drinks with me or stay overnight at my house anymore nor was I welcome in their home. Just recently he decided I was allowed in his girlfriend's car when he was in it too. Anyway, we started talking and it was like no time had passed at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe invited me over a few days later to hang out. I accepted only to fix something of mine with his help, not to hang out, and made that clear. I stayed for 2 hours. It was a lot of fun. He apologized to me for how he acted and told me he's in therapy now. He 100% doesn't drink anymore and hasn't for a month. I know my emotions are my responsibility, not his, so I just thanked him for the apology and went home. But the thing is, I was devastated when he cut me off like that, and as much as I want to be friends with him again, I don't think I can be. I'm posting this here because I wanted advice from others who struggle with alcoholism. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs this just part of recovery? Should I just maintain a polite but firm distance? I don't want to do anything that would - and I'm choosing my words very carefully here because I KNOW I'm not responsible for his feelings or his drinking - make it more likely for him to relapse. I don't think it's in my best interest to let him be my friend again and my SO is of the same opinion. In fact my SO, who also struggles with drinking, is of the opinion that I shouldn't speak to this ex-friend of mine until he apologizes. Which he has, but it was a half-assed \"btw, sorry I was so shitty to you\" as I was on my way out the door. It felt sincere but not good enough, considering how much he hurt me. I thought we were very close and I guess I was wrong.",

            "selftext": "I currently work at a doctors office as a medical assistant. It\u2019s a small practice so me and my coworkers are a pretty tight knit group. There are two doctors in our office, one of them being the owner( I\u2019ll call him Dr. O). The non-owner (ill call him Dr. A), is an obvious alcoholic. \n\nAs someone who has had drinking issues in the past, I noticed right away when I started working there about 6 months ago. He constantly reeks of alcohol, is very shaky, is constantly sweating, and just looks like total crap in general. \n\nAfter about a month of me working there, I became pretty comfortable with my coworkers and asked them if they ever smelled alcohol on Dr. A. They all said something along the lines of \u201coh yeah he\u2019s a raging alcoholic and drinks all day, blah blah blah\u201d. The flood gates opened and it seemed like everyone just knew but didn\u2019t really care. They all seemed to have numerous stories about him drinking at work, etc.\n\nIt seems like everyone in the practice knows about Dr. A\u2019s alcohol issue, except for Dr. O. Dr. O seems totally oblivious and unaware. \n\nMy husband is urging me to reach out to him and extend a helping hand as someone who has struggled in the past, but I feel like it\u2019s not my place to interfere. First, as someone who has struggled, I don\u2019t think I would have appreciated being approached in an unsolicited manner. Second, my position as his subordinate puts my job at risk.  On the other hand, I feel an obligation to do something as a fellow medical professional (even as a low-level MA) because I feel like he is putting patients at risk. Even though he is just an eye doctor, he does perform surgeries on a weekly basis. \n\nI feel like if I approach him or his boss Dr. O, I could really mess his life up, on the other hand, I\u2019m afraid he is risking messing other people\u2019s lives up due to treating patients while intoxicated.\n\nAny help/insight would be much appreciated.",

I remember agreeing to having a random hookup \u201cfinish\u201d inside of me, hell I was fucked up on a bender. Why wouldn\u2019t I let someone do the deed? Well, it\u2019s been a month and a missed period since then and I spent the day in a free woman\u2019s health clinic taking the first round of my abortion pills. I know I can\u2019t drink for the next 14 days after I take the second round of meds because they can cause serious internal bleeding. So here I am.... drinking my last drink and am going to use this as a serious life changer.

            "selftext": "Hi everyone! I want to share my story with you. Mostly because alcoholism of my dad sort of shaped me. Made me who I am today. But instead of talking about my life, im just curious if anyone every happened to deal with something similar or has any advice. Im gonna turn 18 in 5 days, and in about 2 years move from my home to a different country so i already gave up on my dad but if any of you dealt with something like this/can provide advice, i would gladly read it. Let's get to my story.   \n\n\nIm after 7 years of depression proven my psychiatrist. Demons of the past, still haunt me sometimes but with time i learnt to deal with them. My dad is an alcoholic, he's a profesional soldier. He's a colonel in my country and is just one step under, the  Ministry of National Defense. So yea, he earns quite a lot, wouldn't call him rich, but he definietely lives better than an average person.   \nHe enjoys cheep bears and vodka, also the most expensive cigarretes avaliable in local superemarkets. One i calculated how much money, he's wasting... well a lot. To put it into perspective, without giving any specific numbers (theese things everywhere cost different amounts), he smokes over 1 package of cigarettes a day, and also drinks enough beer that when i was younger the money from selling cans to the local junkyard was enough to satisfy my needs.   \n\n\nI rememmber him as a ridicolously intelligent person, he worked hard, was sort of a workoholic. He's also a perfectionist. I loved him, he was still drinking when i was younger but not that much. I can quite confidentially say that he's has alcoholic genes. Eveyrone in his family drunk a lot. For example, his brother drunk himself to death and his other one, is on a good way to do so, his sister thoe is clean. Im sometimes scared that i will become an alcoholic like him too, especially because my future choice of job is crazy stressfull. Im always '' the sober one'' on parties.   \n\n\nHe's not really, aggresive. I mean he was, he once even hit my mother, and destroyed her plants with an axe but when we were away from home. Right now im big enough ( im taller and i weight more) that i can easly put him down. I once had to, i hit him really hard in the head. He fell over on the grass (it happened outside). Then the next day, he said that I failed him, becasue he never hit his father. I have to be honest i was kinda stunned when he said that. He was the aggresive one. He especially enjoys saying that my mother is ''the dumb one'' (that's the best way that i can translate it).   \n\n\nHe's also ill. He's pancreas is on the verge of shutting down but he doesn't stop. Also im 100% sure that he has lung cancer, the way he always caughs like he's close to puking almost, is so characteristic. My mother says that his father also coughed like that (he died of a lung cancer). At the same time, he gets mad when someone prepares something heavy or with a decent amount of fat in it, and says that he won't eat it becuase he's pancreas is in bad condition. When i was 12 we had to live in another house, because he was too aggresive to deal with. After that he stopped. Usually when he starts drinking he's totally drunk and stays like that for about a week. Then, the first day of ''soberness'' is always the worst for him, he's angry, and likes to point out everything to the point of dellusion, when he just starts making up things on the go.   \n\n\nHe also in 2002 got put in military jail for dirnking too much. Stayed in it for about 4 months. That was the momment when something snapped in him. He changed, of course he made quite a career, but he's drinking problem started to strengthen every day. He had been drinking since he was 15, but just more than average. Nothing too big, just that kind of a person everyone said. They were wrong.   \n\n\nI feel sad for that poor idiot. I watched him, everyday he became more and more stupid. I sometimes like to joke that when he drinks if you be quiet enough you can hear he's grey cells dying. He's a shadow of former himslef. To give you an example how big of a drinker he is. Im 2 cm taller than him, and i weight more (around 80kg), and i wear S clothes. He's smaller and 6 kg lighter, but wears clothes XXL. He kinda looks like a skeleton with swollen liver.   \n\n\nHe also, has a sad story. He's father died when i was around 1 year old (2002 after the mission in Irac). He promised my mother that he won't do the same. He's on a good way to repeat his father mistakes. It is also hard for my mother. I support her as much as i can but she also snapped. There is something wrong with her mind, i won't go for the details i just want to let you know about it.   \n\n\nTo close this chaotic essay. I just feel sad for him. I want to help him, not because he's my father but becuase he was once a wonderful man, able to work really hard, wise, and brilliant. He refuses any treatment. He says that ''is it wrong that i want to drink from time to time?''. He just doesn't see the problem. Even after i came back from the asylum because i was really close to suicide i never even heard him talking about it. We can't just leave him. My mom stubbornly it's not possible. He's alone, everyone left him becuase he's sainter and smarter than Pope and Einstein combined (in is opponion).  \n\n\nShould i give up or try this one last time?   \n\n\nThank you for reading this chaotic mess, i was never good at expressing my emotions in a organized manner. Maybe im just chaotic by nature. If this made it harder to understand to you, i'm sorry.",

Like, I don't crave booze when I don't have it. I can go months, and not even think about it. But once I'm given one drink I just can't stop at one. I have to drink it all or at least until I get sick. Liquour usually triples or more with a bit of mix.\n\nI hate it for the fact I become very unpredictable (Like shopping online spending stupidly or messaging an ex after 4 years)\n\nI just never thought of having a problem in the sense of an addiction because I don't crave it, I don't go out of my way for it, but once I start I can't stop. I have to just pound them back.\n\nFor the record my dad is an alcoholic and his father was before him (they both sobered up, my dad is sober for like 6 years now)\n\nJust would like someones honest thoughts.

I got some great advice and after searching we found a wonderful treatment center for my mom to go to. She did six months of outpatient treatment and didn\u2019t have a drop from the day she started. I just wanted to come here and thank all of you. For sharing your struggles and successes. For all the support you\u2019ve shown to one another that indirectly helped me. I got my mom back! I hope and pray that all of you or your family members achieve your goals. You can do it!! Thank you, thank you, thank you. From the bottom of my heart.",

            "selftext": "I'm writing this post as a 28 year old daughter of an alcoholic. He's struggled for most of his life with this but for the most part has been tolerable to us children and my mom. My parents have been married for 26 years as of today.\n\nHe was doing okay when I graduated high school in 2009. At that point I moved out of state. I visited in 2014 and during those few months my dad was arrested for DUI and spent the night in jail. He lost his license and for the next 6 months my mom and two little brothers had to adjust their lives to help drive him to work and whatnot. There were clearly other things that happened that escalated this into being more serious. That was the last major thing until I moved back to my home state in 2017.\n\nI don't live with them or visit enough to know the daily occurrences but my first Christmas home my mom and brothers pulled me aside and said we needed to have an intervention for my dad. He had turned into an angry person and was also smoking marijuana more and the relationship between all of them was very strained. We were planning the intervention for the following month however my older brother then got into some legal troubles and that had to be our priority.\n\nBy the time everything cool down enough we started to try to plan it a second time and right on cue my older brother got into legal trouble for the second time and this resulted in my niece and nephew living with my parents temporarily. These circumstances made it very difficult to try to plan or have an intervention for my dad. \n\nI woke up this morning to messages from my mom saying that this is the third night in a row she's had to pick up my Dad drunk and this time he was falling down and could barely walk was slurring his speech terribly and ended up pissing himself. My mom had just learned about the death of an employee and had a lot of phone calls to make and really needed his support. She is breaking down, and I can see it happening.\n\nShe told me that she's not sure what she will do when my younger brother's move out in the next year or two  and that the only option she sees is to divorce him  before things get worse. I can see all 3 of them living with him struggling and it's breaking my heart.\n\nObviously no child wants their parents to get a divorce  though I do understand that sometimes it's necessary. I told her that maybe now is the time that we have to make his intervention a priority to see if there is a chance at repairing their relationships. \n\nMy question is this: is there anything family members can say or do that will show that this is truly the last straw and he needs to change? Or is this 100% his decision? If we have an intervention, I just want to be sure it's effective. I've done research, but maybe someone who has actually held one, or had one for themselves can help answer?",

Is having a couple drinks of hard liquor before bed every night something to be worried about? I'm in college which certainly doesn't help, and my friends and I usually get drunk at least twice a week.\n\nI have trouble sleeping and alcohol usually helps for some reason, but I feel off if I try to sleep without it. Then again, I feel the same way if I don't take melatonin. Alcoholism does somewhat run in my family, not extreme, but my uncle was reaaalllyyyy bad and my half brother had some issues a while back.\n\nI never drink during the day, nor do I desire to, but once I'm in my room before I go to sleep, I just want to drink at least a little. My tolerance is also really high, which I hate. One time I finished a fifth of whiskey in 2 hours without even realizing it.\n\nSorry for the long post, but what are your opinions?",

I want help, and was initially intrigued by ACA. \n\nUntil I learned it was a 12-step program. I hate 12-step programs. I hate their non-scientific, non-medical approach to treating addiction. I hate their propaganda about addiction being outside of your control. I hate their forcing religion on you.\n\nI\u2019m just not open to their methods. The problem is, any research I do about resources for children of alcoholics always leads back to there. Have any of you encountered programs targeted toward children of alcoholics that DO NOT utilize the 12 steps? I\u2019m looking for a good CBT therapist in my area but I\u2019m also interested in something specifically targeted at people like me. \n\nThanks.",

One thing that keeps getting me is a crazy sense of anxiety when I'm not drinking.  That with some bad insomnia.  I've read that being active/exercising help with quitting.   However between the anxiety and insomnia I've struggled with maintaining or even starting an exercise  schedule.  My weight has gotten out of control and I'm so... so tired all the time.  While I've been a long time drinker over the passed year my drinking has been daily(morning,noon night....).  Has anyone else experienced these symptoms when trying to quit? Is there a secret to overcoming them.  Or is this just one of these 'suck it up' moments in life ?",

In the past 6 months however it has gone completely off the rails as some PTSD has resurfaced and alcohol was my choice to eliminate the shame and self hatred of the incident. I have an amazing girlfriend of 19, who had been living with me for about 6 months, and who has supported me through all my mental health issues- even actively researching medications etc. A few months ago she found me hiding a bit of vodka. And then ALOT of vodka. This went on for a few months until I couldn\u2019t stand lying to her anymore and I was obviously not functioning/suicidal so I checked myself into detox. Today I was released from detox excited to come home and hug and kiss her and tell her how excited I was about our future when I found our room empty. I know she had been planning to move out for some time and we are still very much together. But I had just thought she would be there when I got home. I cried for awhile and then felt very triggered to go and get a drink to to wash away the pain even after all the hard work I had done. I think she is still committed. We\u2019ve both been there together for a long time. And she\u2019s taught me a lesson before when she found me hiding alcohol. It just seemed like a strange time to treat me a lesson when I had just gone through something rather harrowing. I\u2019m writing this through tears so I apologize for the incoherence. All the best to recovering people out there and any advice or conversation would mean the absolute world &lt;3",

Barely and damage to it, but they want a new fence so it's gonna run me $1000 for the spool, not including paying someone to do it. They're not pressing charges so I'm not gonna argue about just fixing the fence. I got cited for public intoxication.\n\nAnyways, this happened 3 nights ago. Decided my best bet is to cut alcohol out of my life. I was doing 8-13 shots every night for the last 54 days. How dangerous is this gonna be for me to to cold turkey? I went cold turkey off 5 Xanax a day for a month a little over a year ago and ended up having a seizure which led to me having 2 compression fractures in my spine. Need help because I definitely don't want that, or possible something worse to happen. I take kratom daily for back pain, not sure if that would assist with alcohol withdrawals.",

I start to forget how I am not in charge of myself around alcohol.\n\nThese 2 periods of sobriety were the best periods of my life. It's clear sobriety is the best thing since sliced bread.\n\nLately I've started drinking too much again. I am a binge drinker, so I drink 2x a week for 12+ hours and nothing is open anymore.

The only thing that convinced every fibre of my body that alcohol is a bad idea, is a horrible situation(suicide attempts, social exclusion, etc). \n\nWhat are recommendex strategies to deal with it before it gets to a crisis situation?

Can\u2019t seem to quit those. I have waves of wanting to quit and have quit before but lately it just doesn\u2019t feel like a priority to me. I even went to the doctors and got prescribed to Chantix and have yet to start taking it. \n\nI have terrible sleep anytime I don\u2019t drink enough. I know they say alcohol messes with your sleep but I can\u2019t sleep well without it. I can usually fall asleep after a while but end up waking up several times a night I don\u2019t and just lie awake not able to fall asleep unless I drink. It\u2019s not healthy and I am fully aware that I need to make changes to my life. \n\nI can\u2019t fully quit drinking. It\u2019s too socially acceptable to go out and my bf likes to drink too but definitely is more in control of his drinking. He\u2019ll go out and we\u2019ll drink but there\u2019s nights I want to drink a lot and he\u2019ll be fine with just drinking one or two drinks. \n\nHow do I get my shit together?\n\nTLDR; been drinking too much and in excess every time.

I rarely drink, other than a bit of wine here and there. My boyfriend drinks every single night and gets agitated if he can't. He refuses to prove to me that he could actually go a month without drinking, further signifying he is dependent on it. \n\nHe drinks 4-7 beers on average a night, which I know isn't that much and says I am ignorant and everyone is ignorant when trying to discuss my concerns and the general guidelines that are set by people who research and have qualifications regarding this sort of stuff. I'm ignorant, scientists and doctors are ignorant, and he has it under control...\n\nIs it possible to develop health issues earlier in life or is it most common after 40 or 50 years old? I worry so much about him. That I'm just gonna find him in an alcohol induced coma one day. He already seems to be developing symptoms similar to arthritis and he is only 26! People think he is in his 30's or 40's because he has aged so much in the last few years. \n\nI feel like I had a coworker tell me once that her friend died from liver disease due to alcohol consumption in his early 30's but I would think the level of consumption would have had to be insane, right?",

            "selftext": "I just feel like putting this out there, somewhere, wherever this is. I don't know where this is going, but here goes.\n\nLaying in bed after \"studying\" for my Respiratory Therapy test. Wife is working night shift, she's an RN. My birthday is coming up, June 18. I'll be 31. I have been married for 6 years now.  I have a 5 year old and 2 year old. Both daughters. Both amazing. All this great stuff, yet I have drank heavily for all 6 of these years married to my wife. Mostly beer, but some days I'll get a small thing of liquor, or dip into my wife's vodka she sometimes buys. A lot of this she doesn't know about. She doesn't know every day, on my way home from work or school I stop by the old reliable gas station and get 3 25 oz Natty Daddy's. She does know I have an issue, though because the alcohol that is in the house -that she's aware of- won't stay here more than a day or two. Or NyQuil, or if one of us gets sick, the Codeine cough syrup. I take my wife's Adderall to study with now, too. Have been for years. About 6 years. There might be a pattern here. I started school before I even met her, 10 years ago. Procrastinating, always changing majors... 6 years ago I started trying to pursue nursing school. I'd do awesome in my prerequisite courses. All A's. I'm a great bullshitter in community college, but when it came time to take the entrance exam for the program I flubbed it. 2 years in a row. I switched to Respiratory, a year later I'm in. Fifteen people in my 2020 class. I'm waiting for them and my teacher to find out I'm a fraud. I feel like a fraud. I can't actually imagine graduating and getting my boards. I have so much riding on this, years and years of loans, amassing credit card debt, bleeding my wife of her money, medication, and time. She's starting to look older, stress settling in on her. She supports us all. She conquered so much, a crippling disease when she was younger, Guillan-Barre, multiple surgeries, she walked with a walker when she was a child and still wears a brace to this day to walk with. Yet she hardly complains (even though I see her limp and wince and trip). She could have a handicap sticker, she denies it. She could have a medication problem, nope. She is a bonified hero, always taking care of all of us and marching on, brace and all. My girls are blossoming, and they both have their own little personality. My five year old it's so sweet and caring she was awarded the unjudging friendship award at her Pre-K graduation ceremony. My two year old is feisty, yet she learns from my five year old and her mom and is just as caring when she needs to be. I have all these things. \n\nwhile I was studying for a very hard test tomorrow, I have drank a six pack of Natty Ice. Earlier this morning I got out of school early and had 3 tall Natty Daddy's, slept in my car for an hour, came home and piddled/studied. 6 years ago I was 160 lbs at 5'6\". A year ago at the height of my drinking problem, I was 215. I stopped drinking for about a month, then started back. but I've tried to change my eating habits and the adderal helps me not eat from time to time. I'm about 190 now. Yet I look in the mirror and see someone I don't know. Sometimes I have bouts of hypochondria and think my liver is failing, I'll get anxious and get on Google for the rest of the night. While I am drinking. It's a weird downward spiral where I punish myself, that I haven't figured out how to get out of. I got baptized a couple months ago. For my wife but also for myself. I thought it would help. Couple days later my wife was let down again, thinking she hit the adderal good enough, and then noticed the ice in the vodka that was in the freezer. I tried to hide the fact that I drank 3/4 of it the night before, after she put the kids to bed and went to bed herself. I don't know what I'm doing on here, I just know I need to do something. I have no time, nor the patience I feel like, for an AA meeting. I feel like I'm ranting and it's not going to make sense when I'm done, but oh well. I just want to be normal, to be better.\n\nI want to stop. I want to relish in this life that is here for me, be able to be with my kids sober, to impress my wonderful wife. I want to look back from the future thinking I've beat it. I don't want to do this anymore. But I keep doing it regardless. I'm so depressed. I'm such a fuck up. I'm a thief. I'm an asshole, a bad father, husband, son. I'm a coward. I'm a drunk. \n\nI hate to self loathe in front of people. I usually hide this well. But I feel like I needed to get this out of my own head, journaling feels too artificial, and I feel like I'm being fake to myself in a journal. I don't know. \n\nIf anyone actually made it this far in this pathetic post, thanks for reading. I'll try not to drink tomorrow.",

            "selftext": "I\u2019m sorry this is long but I need to get this off my chest.\n\nMy boyfriend [M25] and I [F24] have been dating for nearly 8 years, since we were both 17. We have been through a lot together, and I have learned a lot about myself since we\u2019ve started dating. I\u2019m not very close with my family and neither is he, so we found comfort in eachother. Overall, we\u2019ve always managed to adapt and to grow together, and I know him very very well. For the past 2 1/2 years though, my boyfriend has suffered with alcoholism. I\u2019m not sure how much more adapting I can do. \n\nAt first, it was him just constantly being angry, loud and obnoxious. I kept having to defend him to my family, his family, our friends. \u201cOh he\u2019s just having fun\u201d Then, after a while, he became violent, would punch walls and counters, would shove me around, would hit himself in the face. I found myself cleaning up mess after mess of his, one time coming home to see his tooth knocked out; another time I had to track him down on find my iPhone to a church parking lot to find him passed out in his work van. Later, on our 7th anniversary no less, he got picked up by a Detox unit and spent the evening in detox. It kept culminating and he kept ignoring the signs. I got him therapy and paid for it, kept encouraging him to be honest with himself about his alcoholism, but it was all ignored until it all came to head and he ended up getting a DUI. I helped him through that. We had to move in with his parents so that he could have the money to pay for his DUI, and that hasn\u2019t helped, due to most of his problems being with his parents. \n\nI know I make him sound terrible, but he\u2019s actually a really sweet man. He has always been very kindhearted, funny, smart, artistic and gentle. The alcoholism does not suit him. He is a completely opposite person when he is drunk verses when he is sober. He is a good guy, he has problems, but he generally is a good person.  He just is a sad person. He wants to be in the music business but his band didn\u2019t work out and he hasn\u2019t tried again, which is what started his alcoholism (at least that\u2019s what he blames) \n\nHe knows how terrible he is when he drinks, yet nothing has changed. I tell him that I genuinely hate who he is when he drinks, I tell him\nI can\u2019t handle it and don\u2019t want to, I tell him the mental strain it puts on me is unbearable. He looks me in the eyes and believes me, acknowledges my pain, promises he won\u2019t do it again, and every single time, it seems to truthful and like he really means it. But then he drinks again. He goes to AA and still drinks every other day. He couldn\u2019t handle calling his sponsor 3 times a week, so he bailed on him. Couldn\u2019t handle his sponsors advice of doing a 12 step program, only goes to AA at most twice a week.\n\nI\u2019m not asking \u201cshould I leave?\u201d Because honestly ......I know I should. Im often miserable, I\u2019m constantly questioning him, even when he\u2019s sober, and that\u2019s not healthy. I really deeply love him though. He\u2019s my high school sweetheart, the man I planned to start a family with. When I look at him I feel bad for him, for the potential wasted. For the last nearly 3 years of our life together, wasted. \n\nI\u2019m not so stupid to think that we have to last or I will never find someone else. I just feel a responsibility towards him; like \u201cfor better and for worse\u201d almost, like he needs one friend that won\u2019t give up on him because at this point, I\u2019m one of the only ones left, one of the only bridges he hasn\u2019t burned. I would feel terrible if I left him and he killed himself or attempted to. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t take his recovery seriously. I really want him to but don\u2019t want to get my hopes up. What should I do? I would prefer kindness in your responses but understand that this *is* the Internet",

            "selftext": "Hey Reddit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a bit lost with my boyfriend. I don't know if I would even call him an alcoholic? He drinks kind of heavily one to two times a week, but it always seems like it's an accident, he never means to get that drunk. He gets home, driving tipsy, or sometimes black out drunk, and I can always tell he had too much to drink. I can see it in his walk, his eyes, and even his breathing. He always takes a three hour long nap, and I always cry because we usually had plans that evening and he just... forgets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's usually because he gets caught up with friends or coworkers after work and talks to them, and drinks while he's still at work (clocked out, he works at a brewery though). I'm to the point where I have massive anxiety attacks if he isn't home in the evening. I'm always afraid he'll come home and stumble into the bedroom, and not talk to me. Because he's so drunk that he can't. He says he's getting better, but I don't feel that way. Says he drinks low alcohol percentage beer, and doesn't get black out drunk anymore so, it's okay if he comes home tipsy, he thinks.  \n\n\nI'm tired of worrying about him being out with friends, and being worried at him at any social events with drinking. Worried about him getting pulled over when he drives home, worried about him pissing in my bed in his sleep. It's hard, he's not violent or abusive to me. Most things that I have read on spouses regarding alcoholism seems to center about abuse, and I don't have that. Because of this, I almost doubt that's he an alcoholic? I've listed this all out, sometimes I feel crazy and that it's so obvious. I figured I would post here, because I'm so unsure.   \n\n\nWill this just get worse, even when he wants to get better? Are there any good resources for coping with a spouse who is probably an alcoholic, but who is also not violent or abusive?  \n\n\nThank you.",

            "selftext": "I've been an alcoholic for about 2 years and a drug user for 5. I drink roughly 4 times a week and usually have 1-2 beers on the days that I'm not drinking. Last weekend I had a particularly heavy drinking session from Thursday to Sunday, where I was drinking from Saturday evening to Sunday late afternoon with no breaks. \n\nI woke up Sunday around 10pm, and as I lay in bed in the dark later around 3/4am to try to get more sleep, I started hallucinating (I'm not sure if this is the right term). I was completely sober by this point. I saw some stuff that looked like threads floating right above my head and felt like ants were crawling all over my legs. I figured it was just due to drinking way too heavily over the last few days and as these hallucinations were rather mild I didn't think much of it. I also got a bit of sleep paralysis with no hallucinations (so I was basically just paralysed in bed for a while).\n\nMonday afternoon I was getting the sweats - I'm not sure if this is a symptom of alcoholism but I drank one beer and felt a lot better. At night (was completely sober by this point), my hallucinations were a lot worse and much more vivid than Sunday. It felt like I was dreaming although I knew I was still awake and my eyes were open but I couldn't move at all. I was seeing my room in the dark and hallucinating several people I didn't recognize talking to me about random things (and everyone was drinking in my hallucinations). I was basically floating in and out of these hallucinations as I realized that looking directly at any of them (took a lot of effort as I was paralysed) would cause them to sort of fade away and I'd snap out of it and I could move again. But every time I felt myself drifting off to sleep, I'd just start hallucinating again. The entire time, I was well aware that I was still awake (as I could see my room) and just hallucinating. The last hallucination, as I looked directly at the man speaking to me, he lunged for my face but faded away before he could make \"contact\". Obviously this scared me but my friend suggested I play some music and I was able to fall asleep no problem once I did that.\n\nI figure this is just a symptom of alcohol withdrawals as the amount I drank on Sat-Sun was definitely way too much. Has anyone else experienced this? Is it permanent? I know of someone who has alcohol-induced psychosis and I'm just wondering if this could be it. Will this happen every time I drink and will it get worse if I continue to drink? Should I see a doctor about it or will it be okay if I just limit the amount I drink?\n\nThanks for reading and I'm sorry if my post is difficult to understand, I don't really know how to explain these hallucinations as I've never experienced anything like it before.",

            "selftext": " \n\nHi,\n\n35 year old male here. I have been an addict for 15 years, first marijuana and progressively alcohol.\n\nI had \"good\" periods during which I only drank during social events, but always binging and needing to go full drunk. I also had very bad periods, drinking myself to bed 1 day out of 2. Overall, I have always known there was something wrong with my drinking. In my entourage, my mom had a bad drinking period and is now almost completely sober, and seems to have it under control. My friends around me are all party goers like me, even if with time it tends to be less and less.\n\nThis year, I am getting married with my girlfriend, I love her very much ! We don't live together and plan to move in a place together very soon. She wasn't aware of my problem and I told her what was up 2 weeks ago, because I didn't want to trap her into it, and also because I know that I will need support.\n\nI do not drink daily, but have a weekly or bi-weekly urge to get hammered. During the past year, I did it more and more by myself, in the end almost exclusively. This lead me to a very rough patch last october, as the drinking obviously triggered an anxiety and strong fatigue disorder. I didn't get treatment for it and the symptoms disappeared in a month or so. I was a zombie. At the time, I realized I had to do something about my lifestyle, started meditating (still does, helps me a lot). In a very unclever move, I decided that I could also get back to partying and drinking.\n\n10 days ago, the same anxiety and fatigue episode started after I got drunk 2 evenings in a row. It's a vicious circle : I don't sleep well, my brain just wakes up after 4 hours of bad sleep and I half sleep with nightmares until the day sets. This leads to extreme fatigue and mixes with social anxiety, something I have always managed to deal with, but not when I am very tired. I have decided to take sleeping pills in order to kill the cycle, which works in a way but is a temporary fix. I also decided that this time I had to do something about my drinking, I went to a doctor I know, and told him about my addiction. He referred me to a psychologist I will start to see soon, and prescribed me antidepressants in order to get through the anxiety phase.\n\nI'm feeling scared about the perspective to decide to cut definitely drinking. I see my drinking as something that is a part of me and my drunkness state something my friends appreciate. I think this is a common feeling for addicts. My girlfriend is very supportive but I am aware that I need to do it by myself and not rely on her too much. I hesitate to start the antidepressant treatment (Prozac) until I see the psychologist, because I don't like to take medications. He told me there were close to no side effects, no addiction and that it was a ok way to deal with the anxiety peak. Any thoughts about this ?\n\nThanks in advance for the opinions !\n\nH.",

Recently though he started his marijuana use again and I know at all rehab centers that\u2019s grounds for readmission. He does have a marijuana card but I know that the rehab centers still would readmit for a positive THC test. \n\nMy question is, if he started marijuana again should I expect a relapse soon?",

            "selftext": "I definitely get that if I have to ask then the answer is probably yes... but I still feel like I need to ask. \n\nSo I started heavily drinking with my friends as a teenager and it continued into my early teens. Then by the time I was in my mid twenties I was drinking almost a full bottle of vodka a day and blacking our most nights. \n\nI went to the doctors one day since I was feeling terrible. It turned out i was going through withdrawals. I had really high count of toxins in my liver and high blood pressure. \n\nSo I stopped drinking so much since I was scared for my health. I\u2019ve since now been cleared by the same doctor. My liver is back to normal and my high bp is gone. \n\nWell I haven\u2019t 100% abstained from alcohol. I still go out with friends ever couple months and we\u2019ll have 4 or 5 drinks. 2-3 weekends out of the month I\u2019ll have a 2-3 glasses of wine or a couple beers. Every so often like once or twice a month I\u2019ll have a couple drinks mid week. \n\nBut I\u2019m no longer drinking till I black out. I drink a few and then stop and don\u2019t feel the want or need to drink more. \n\nWell my husband today told me that he still thinks I\u2019m an alcoholic and how much I drink is bad and that \u201calcoholics like me\u201d can\u2019t drink in moderation and eventually I\u2019m just going to start drinking till I black out again. \n\nI personally don\u2019t feel like I ever want to do that again and that I\u2019m over that type of relationship with alcohol. I personally like to keep away from spirits now because I don\u2019t like how hard they hit me now. \n\nSo yea..... \n\nTell the truth. Was I an alcoholic? Am I still one?",

My mom started drinking when I was beginning 7th grade, a wine cooler or two every night with dinner. Then it progressed, and my step-dad helped her receive the helped she needed. Since then, she has relapsed around 6 times (i think), and ive now just completed 10th grade. Tonight, my brother (he's 14) found my mom drinking alcohol that's clear and in a square bottle. She tried to explain to him, but he walked out and just went to his room. From, there he texted me (didn't wanna come in my room and risk my mom hearing). I have been through this with her before so im a little more level headed than other times, but i still need advice. My step dad doesnt know, and I've suspected it for a while but was too afraid to say anything. I was thinking that maybe I should wait till it's late tonight (or she goes outside to smoke), and take the alcohol and hide it in my room. Shes does not get violent when tipsy, drunk, or sober so I don't have to worry about that. From there, I wait till it's late, pour it outside in the corner of our backyard, and hide the bottle in my room. I know she's gonna find out I took it, but im not too concerned about it. Then I give her a day, see if she's told my step-dad, and if she hasn't I'll bring it up to her and convince her to tell him. I have no clue if this is a good idea, but all I know is that im scared because i know she's gonna be sent to the hospital again for a week or two, and she hallucinates/has delusions really bad when detoxing and it's gonna hurt her alot.",

            "selftext": "First a little back story. My friend is 28. Our group is probably partying or drinking since we are 16 almost every week. Myself and others don\u2019t do it that regularly anymore. But alcohol once (not only one drink) a week is pretty normal. Most of us are still students so I would guess that\u2019s normal. \n\nOver the last year I\u2019m getting more and more worried about this friend. Many of us moved away or for other life circumstances we don\u2019t see us that often anymore. So his group and activities also changed. \nBut every activity is connected to drinking. He became part of the fire department (in Germany a lot of the fire fighters are volunteers)  after each exercises there is drinking. Not a problem per se but he will get smashed even if he needs to work the next day. He started visiting pubs on Thursday and has more than 5 beers. He started driving when he had a few beers. \n\nLast weekend we and another old friend went out to the Biergarten. He was still a bit tipsy from his night out.  But other than that his drinking seemed normal. \nFor the next day we were getting together to have a barbecue. Well guess what: He already had three beers when we arrived. No one else was drinking alcohol, but he still had 5 until we left. \n\nHis brother was also there and told us that yesterday he needed to help  him open the door. He was too drunk to open it. Well considering that and other things we basically told him that he is acting like an alcoholic. He did stuff like lying about the numbers of drinks he had. \n\nThis was the devastating part. He was not openly denying it, but damn he seems to be in his own world. For example we told him it\u2019s to much  ( no problem to drink a beer //yes but not three days a row more than 5), driving under influence is dangerous ( if you drive with sandals that is also dangerous), ...\nHis answers are in brackets. \n\nIt\u2019s so hard to see such a close friend like this. He also used to be quite good informed in politics, economics and other stuff. But this changed as well. Now he has a few narrow-minded opinions. Even in soccer he is not interested in details anymore. \n\nIt\u2019s hard for me to see and I am really worried. Because where would that end? \nI want to help him, but I\u2019m not sure how. We also planned to go to an exotic restaurant in the near future. I really want to go but I\u2019m worried that this activity will make him drink. Which would make me feel bad. (Not for the reason that he is drunk, but because I see what is happening to him). Should I do it? At this point I have absolutely no clue how to help him, so I hope someone has an advices for me.",

            "selftext": "I've been  active here and in the 'stopdrinking' subred\" over the weekend while trying to sober up. I've been failing miserably.  \"stopdrinking\" gave me a temp ban for breaking the rules (I apologized).  My wife has giving me some 'tough love' to help motivate me but that's not what I need and I know I've been needy as hell lately.  An old friend and roommate who understands drinking gave me good advice but he lives on the other side of the country now.  I feel great about the idea of finding some clinic I can turn myself too.  But everything I've learned theirs a several day 'detoxing' period and I just cant miss that much work. I've been sober before during my 15+ years a drinking.  Over the passed year I've switched from \"nights only\" to a daily pattern that involves morning and lunch alcohol.  Since then cutting back is tough.  There is a part of me that feels I can't handle it after trying the last three days.  I don't know what to do at this point.  There's been a 'just put it down\" response I've been getting.  Just typing those words give me anxiety.  I made an attempt to go to an AA office near my work today.  Funny story - its in the same building as the college I went to/occupied the space and a source of a lot of my anxiety that has come with me trying to quit.  I know I can do it If I can just get passed these first couple of days.  Any support is appreciated. Thank you!",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone. I am trying to figure out if I should have a talk with my dad about his drinking habits.\n\nMy dad works a fairly stressful job though its a lot easier now that he's working slightly less hours. His kids including myself are grown and don't really need the financial support but he is at the point in his life where he worked pretty much his life's entirety so he has no other identity other than work. One way he would cope with the stress is by drinking and its a habit that has also stuck with him.\n\nThe sad thing is even when my dad has days off, he knows no other way of relaxing other than drinking. So even when he's not even particularly stressed or in a relaxed mood he STILL drinks. Sometimes even more.\n\nMy dad turned 65 recently but that has not changed the amount of drinks he has daily. He can go up to 5 drinks on any given day. And he drinks everyday without fail.\n\nHe does not exhibit any behavior problems when he drinks though. No belligerence or poor conduct at work or home. He usually drinks either in the middle of a day off or at night after work. On any given week, I would say he drinks the equivalent of 15 drinks a week.\n\nSo despite the fact that my dad doesn't have any behavioral problems or misconduct from drinking would you say he has some dependency on alcohol? And if so how do I have a conversation with him about how he can cut down his drinking? I really worry about his health and the fact that he really has nothing else but work and drinking in his daily routine.\n\n\nThank you very much everyone. :)",

            "selftext": "I have a good relationship with my boss. We've known each other a  along time before he was my boss.  We've drank many times together.  However our \"personal\" relationship has changed to a professional one over the years. My drinking got out of hand this passed winter/spring.  He bought it to my attention and I've been taking steps to quit drinking.  I've been seeing a doctor and am hoping to start therapy soon.   While trying to quit drinking I've been dealing with insomnia issues.  Several times I've used my buildings lounge to to help catch up on sleep after confirming my job responsibilities are in good standing.  This was my situation on Friday and I was accused of drinking after spending time on the lounge.  While I've struggled with not drinking I believe I've made progress and this passed friday I wasn't drinking when I choose to use the lounge as a break from my insomnia (I show up an hour early and was \"addressed\" of my  situation just before my shift started). I was told to go home.  Feeling I was fired I packed my desk up and chugged a beer we keep in our office.   After the fact I learned I'm currently employed but will need to explain myself tomorrow.   I don't know what to do.  My drinking has improved but my insomnia has been a hurdle in recovery that does sometimes lead me to drinking in \"unusual hours\". Think drinking between 2am and 4 am... Sometimes 5am when I'm weak.  I need be honest and address this when I have a meeting tomorrow. I've made progress. But any issue I run into now are \"he must be drinking again\" Any advice?",

            "selftext": "So I just got out of the hospital from which I was committed. I did a week of detox and am  still suffering some withdrawal symptoms such as tremors and profuse sweating but I feel better than I have in years. I've tried several times over the years to do it myself but the withdrawals were just too overwhelming especially knowing the dangers. Up until last Saturday I was drinking a handle of whiskey a day. Waking up dry heaving, shaking uncontrollably until I had my morning whiskey. I was a very high functioning alcoholic as in holding the same job for the past 10 years without anyone knowing except close friends. I called my dying father drunk Sunday morning and he I promised I would get treatment but he convinced me to do it right then, so I did, and I'm ever so thankful I did. I'm also thankful to the nurses and staff at the hospital that made sure I was as comfortable as could be in that situation. I really couldn't have done it without them and I am forever greatful. If you feel like it's time to quit, don't  wait, do it now. It's not that simple for some, I understand but the longer you wait the less simple it will get. I feel very fortunate and would love all the support I can get in the days ahead as the struggle isn't over yet, but I'm optimistic.",

Got to 30 days and decided I could just have beer and wine if I promised no liquour. Lasted about 2 days. Once I got the bottles going I was off and running on my bender. Don't remember much. I do remember the last night trying to drink mouhtwash and vomiting. I also remember finding expired Oxys from an old surgery and deciding it would be a good ide to take those for sleep. I literally have never had interest in pills and this is probably what I'm most ashamed of all said and done. \n\nI was lucky to wake up. I went to the ER with my dad later the following night with intense withdrawal symptoms. Been here for 4 nights with 1 left. The nurses and doctors have been wonderful. Probably will check into an in-patient place for a few days after this. God I hope this is the wake up call I need. Not going to keep getting chances.",

            "selftext": "Well my drinking has officially cost me everything. I have not had one day sober in 13 years. I\u2019m 33 now. Over the years my drinking has caused me to progressively have worse and worse behavior towards friends and family and my girlfriend. Till the point of where I have broken things in the house said the Most downright worst things I could ever say to a woman I love. For the past 4 years with her alcohol has transformed me into a monster. It\u2019s has affected my employment because I can\u2019t get up and get to work after drinking everyday. let\u2019s fast forward to Thursday. She informs me she has had enough of my drinking and being verbally abusive while I\u2019m drunk. So wants me to take my name off the lease. This hurt me. So what do I do. Start drinking very heavily. I pass out but not before more verbal abuse. She gets up Friday morning goes to work. Around 12 she arrives at home to get the form to remove my name from the lease. I had already been drinking heavily by that time and just plain refused followed by more verbal abuse. I leave with my brother continue drinking more. She then informs me that she doesn\u2019t want me there and stay at my brothers. I continue drinking and drinking at my brothers. Around 3am I ubered home. I know real bright idea. I was heavily intoxocated and decided I want to go home and I would just sleep in the other bedroom. I stumble in grab my cell phone from our bedroom and pass out. Now mind you earlier this day I was so intoxicated I had a Hallucination where I thought she had some guy come in and take the phone from my hand. I was livid and drunk. So I decide I\u2019m gonna take all of her clothes and place them in the trunk of my car bright idea. So this morning she livid once she sees this. Things don\u2019t escalate as much this morning. She states she is leaving to go to the office for a bit. I\u2019m still intoxicated from the night prior because it\u2019s very early in the morning. So I get the bright idea of I\u2019m gonna use my key to her car and just move it to the other side of the parking lot. Not stealing just doing something petty and dumb. This was it for her she contacted the police and I never wanted it to get to that point. I ended up taking my name off. After sobering up I took a long look at my life and the situations involving alcohol. I can honestly say. Every single time it\u2019s ended fucked up. I have a dui. My first marriage failed because of it. And every other relationship after. I have had enough. My girlfriend was kind enough to allow me to stay here till I get into rehab Monday. I love her but drunk me is a real evil person.  Today I have not had one sip of alcohol I know it\u2019s small. But I honestly don\u2019t want nothing to do with this drug ever again. I love my girlfriend but I can\u2019t blame her for not wanting me. I have to learn to love myself before I can love anyone else. Today marks my first step toward sobriety.",

I would only drink heavy during these social events. Until recently drinking heavy started to make my anger issues ten times worst. I would explode and try to start fights. Until I finally landed to jail it made me realize my drinking and anger problems. It\u2019s hard being around family parties, or with friends and there is always alcohol or someone always asking me what I want to drink. Part of me always tells myself one drink, or I can handle.... it\u2019s been 20 days but I feel like I can still handle one drink and it won\u2019t affect me. Sometimes I feel like it\u2019s not necessary this whole sober life because I dont see myself as an alcoholic... it\u2019s hard to even compare myself or recognize myself as one... that\u2019s why I question if this is necessary",

I\u2019ve been drinking tonight, well because tonight\u2019s a different story. I honestly do t even k ow if I have a problem. My drunk to most people is a slight buzz. No matter how much I drink I\u2019ll always remain a light weight. 4 or 5 shot pretty close to each other will do it for me. And tonight I figured why the hell not. I\u2019ve found a lot of fear and worrisome in this sub reddit. I\u2019ve wanted to stop following and reading it too many times to count. That\u2019s how I know everyone in here is a real legitimate and carrying individual. I\u2019ve  been dealing with alcoholism for some time. I take 4 to 5 shot to go to sleep, because I\u2019m a insomniac, but I\u2019ve recently broken that pattern and made a change. But now... tonight I\u2019m drinking. If anyone is still reading at this point, my girlfriend may be pregnant..which is of course not what I want at this moment. I\u2019m fucking 22! I really can\u2019t deal with this shit. I just starting things out, you know? I\u2019ve been working I accounting since I was 16, and now I\u2019ve finally started my own successful business. Out of all things I thought alcohol would fuck it up for me, not a kid. I do t know what to do, and I know this all doesn\u2019t portray to this sub reddit, but if anyone feel like loading up my ear, go for it.",

I spend so much time time \"thinking sober\" that I neglect other aspects of my life.  My apartment is getting super messy for instance.

            "selftext": "My father Is 50 years old, he\u2019s always been an alcoholic. He started drinking at 7, he used to sneak out and drink directly from wine bottles, later in life it got worse and worse til were we are now.  He has a complicated life story, promiscuous dad that had problems with rage and honestly I think he was abused as a child but I\u2019m not sure.  He had my sister at 21 and me at 23 and he never gave up the partying and the alcohol, It\u2019s been a difficult life for us, his alcohol problem has led to him punching my mom on multiple occasions, sexual harassment of his employees, even a gun chase at some point because he was so drunk he started fighting with people on a bar that were armed. It\u2019s been really hard on us, it\u2019s hard discerning between his rol as a dad and his actions. \n\nThe thing is that he\u2019s very successful despite everything, so he\u2019s never really struggled because of alcohol. They\u2019ve detained him and spent 36 hours in jail because he was driving drunk, he\u2019s crashed, he\u2019s been in fights etc but never hit rock bottom, at least not in his mind. He thinks of drunks as homeless people sleeping on the streets and he\u2019s never going to get to that place. \n\nRight now he\u2019s starting to suffer some natural consequences though . He gets panic attacks the day after drinking and doctors have told him he has a fatty liver. The panic attacks really scare him but he denies it has anything to do with alcohol even though they always happen after a night of heavy drinking (which is almost everyday) he completely denies he has a problem and gets incredibly mad if you even suggest it. \n\nToday it\u2019s currently 4 am and I woke up to him coughing super hard, so I went downstairs and saw him sleeping on the floor with cockroaches running beside him. My heart sunk, it was the saddest thing I\u2019ve seen. I touched him and told him to go upstairs to sleep but he couldn\u2019t even talk. \n\nWhat im asking is, is there any hope for him to realize his problem and get help if he never hits rock bottom? If this life of drinking is all he\u2019s known? \n\nIm not trying to save him (my mom is though) I know there\u2019s nothing I can do and honestly I\u2019m resentful of all the things he\u2019s put us through, so I\u2019m even reluctant to have a relationship with him at all. But now seeing these consequences I was wondering if we should abandon all hope of him admitting his problem and getting help. \n\nTLTR : \nDads 50, started drinking at 7, it\u2019s gotten him in a lot of shit but never seems to hit rock bottom and doesn\u2019t even want to think about admitting to himself he has a problem even though he\u2019s getting panic attack\u2019s after drinking and many other things  like gun chases, domestic violence, sexual abuse etc \nIs there hope?",

A couple days ago I stopped by urgent care and the doctor said this swelling of the liver can happen after drinking and it will return to normal after a few days, and it is not a serious problem, but searching on the internet I haven't found anything to support this - everything I find seems to imply that the swelling means there is a bigger issue to worry about.  \nI'm probably just being overly paranoid considering the amount of drinking I've done is nothing compared to most people who get serious liver issues.  \nHas anyone else experienced this, is the doc right that it's probably nothing and will just recover in time?",

            "selftext": "So I (22) just graduated college a month ago, and I told myself I was going to slow down with my drinking. I always studied during the week and times on the weekend, but I\u2019d be heavily drinking Thursday-Sunday\u2019s. Drinking never really affected my studies. It was always a social thing, but most of the time we\u2019d always drink to the point of passing out. \n\nLike I said, I wanted to slow down all together when I graduated and I\u2019ve been pretty successful, but for the past few weeks I\u2019ve had this haziness throughout my head. I can go through everyday activities (working out, work, socializing, etc.) perfectly fine, but there\u2019s just this obnoxious fog over my head that makes me lightheaded. Driving long distance does make the feeling worse. I thought for the longest time it was allergies because of dogs and pollen (which I have to take medicine for). That changed once I visited my girlfriend for the weekend and we got drunk together and the haziness feeling went away. \n\nI didn\u2019t know if this was normal after someone slows down with drinking, and if it gets better with time. I was tempted to visit an ENT, but still not sure. I really just want peace of mind more than anything.",

I had tried and given up on AA ( X 2) in the past three years. In any case, I was feeling pretty good lately, hadn\u2019t had the old cravings and able to suppress any remnant urges. Made me question why I didn\u2019t get my act together sooner.\n\nThen I had a day where I was able to unexpectedly work from home. I didn\u2019t drink, but I did have two separate, hour long porn viewing sessions and also called a phone sex line. Toward the end of the day after a nice long nap where I remember looking forward to not thinking, I took four sleeping pills and ended up smoking weed with a friend because I was so worried about not being able to sleep that night once I realized the pills weren\u2019t immediately knocking me out.\n\nI had a moment of clarity at the end of the day (while high on the amalgam of chemicals)and realized that wasn\u2019t the day of a normal, sober person and had a better insight into what the dry drunk could be all about.\n\nI realized that my porn/\u201clegal\u201d/\u201csemi-legal\u201d substance use had sneakily escalated the last several weeks and I was not so subtly replacing the escapism provided by alcohol with other activities.\n\nNot sure what to do.

Cops knocked, tried to give me a DUI, I argued, recognized one as a former local nazi skinhead and ran my mouth.  They ended up throwing 80 years of bogus felonies on me, claiming I went Rambo or John Wick on them.  Truth is I was beat up.  I begged my conservative religious family for a lawyer, I had money for one, had never abused them or stole from them.  They convinced the rest of my family not to help because their Al-Anon friend told them I needed to hit rock bottom.  I lost my job, car, place, possessions, my pets died the bad way.   After four months I was finally exonerated at a preliminary hearing, and forced to spend two more months inside on a single charge of obstructing arrest.  I have slowly built my life back into a nice paying job again, but my career aspirations are fucked.  I was to start a new job with McKinsey. My dreams are ruined.",

I\u2019m 19, dropped out of college (I went to a commuter school so it\u2019s not like it was an orchard for friendships). My roommate only wants to hang out like once every two weeks or so.

We talk on the phone for at least an hour most days, but it\u2019s just... different. It\u2019s like \u201cwhy the fuck should I take care of myself if I don\u2019t have anyone in my life?\u201d I would rather be fucked up by substances for an evening than fucked up by my own brain. At least I won\u2019t really remember the first option the next day. It feels like whether I drink or whether I make good decisions in an evening, the result is the same! I\u2019m still gonna feel alone, I\u2019m still gonna be sad, I\u2019m still gonna wake up tomorrow and do this same fucking bullshit all over! I KNOW drinking is not a good decision, especially long term for me, and especially cuz of medications but like... it really doesn\u2019t feel any better than not drinking.\nSorry, this probably is incoherent, I just needed it all out",

My most recent therapist has said that I could even perhaps be depressed, although I consider this situational as I recently lost my job, my friends have slowly dwindled and disappeared and I have struggled to get a new job without having a Uni degree. Alcoholism definitely runs in my family, while both my parents are responsible with drinking, my Maternal uncle, grandfather, grandaunts/uncles and my mothers cousins are/were all major alcoholics and are suffering from the health problems attached. I know I drink too much, I don't really get wasted. Sometimes but not often. But I currently cave in every day to having a drink or three at the end of the day despite saying I wouldn't. I don't get withdrawal and have managed to do \"dry January\" for two years successfully so far.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI suppose what I am asking is, do I sound like an alcoholic? and if not/so what should I look out for?",

I reached out to friends and family, again receiving no help. \nI\u2019ve spent more time sober the past few weeks than I have in years and I now know that I can do it, even if my journey is alone. \nBut dear god, the dreams. They\u2019re so incredibly wretched. \nLast night I dreamt that I was at a family gathering and for some reason my dad left early. The father of my child drove me home, but he hit what he thought was an animal on the way. I was drunk and didn\u2019t realise exactly, just that there was a bang, but I told him to pull over to check. He didn\u2019t, but stashed his car in some kind of wharf. The next few days, my mum and sister started to come around to my house which was pretty well empty apart from myself and a few broken bits of furniture. They were asking where dad was, and it was like the fog started to lift. I started to cry, and asked them to all come around. I thought I had some news, but couldn\u2019t tell out of fear that I was wrong, and because I didn\u2019t want the driver to find out. My mum and sister went to gather the rest of the family, but while they were gone, the driver showed up. He asked what was wrong and I told him my dad didn\u2019t come home the night we\u2019d hit something. I asked him to take me to his car. He seemed oblivious and agreed. We walked through docks, passing massive, white ships to a secluded part. He\u2019d hidden his car under some scrap metal and when he pulled it away, I could see a massive, human sized dent on the bonnet. It was where my father had hit. All at once, all I could see was my father being in the middle of the road, then the horrible thud, and his body being thrown from the car. \nIt was so vivid and I feel sick because I can\u2019t put it out of my mind. \nThis isn\u2019t the first bad dream, they\u2019ve been coming to me every night that I don\u2019t drink, but this is by far the worst. \nI really don\u2019t want to drink, but the dreams just keep getting worse and worse and holy fuck I\u2019m not sure that I can take more than that. \n\nPlease, please tell me they go away",

            "selftext": "I'm recently graduated, 23 years old, and about to start my career in a couple weeks. In terms of my family history, I feel a bit like the scene in the movie \"My Cousin Vinny\": my mother is a heavy alcoholic; my grandfather died at 42 from issues relating to alcoholism; I have 3 uncles and an aunt that are current alcoholics; and another 2 aunts that are recovered alcoholics. Due to this, I feel I have a genetic disposition towards addiction and instant gratification that manifests in many of my actions.\n\nAs it relates to alcohol, I've always been the clich\u00e9 person who can't limit myself to, or sees the point in, only having a couple drinks when I go out--I have a couple drinks, and unstoppable wheels are set into motion until I'm drunk. This has never been a problem before because, with school and work, I've always been to busy to engage in this type of behavior more than once or twice a week. However, over the last month I've been unemployed (I graduated in early May and my job doesn't start until mid June), and I've been getting drunk far more. In fact, I've engaged in excess drinking for the last 6 days, which is why I'm writing this now.\n\nIt's just so difficult to avoid drinking, especially living in Wisconsin; it is engrained in so many aspects of life. The bar or club is usually what friends want to do on weekends. Even other, seemingly unrelated, things (barbecues, sporting events, concerts, going to a friend's house, etc.) usually end up involving drinking to some capacity.\n\nA part of me wants to just quit it all together, but I know this would be a major blow to my social life. Another part thinks forcing myself to stop after only a couple drinks is the most reasonable option; however, I have ultimately failed at this after a few successful nights when I have tried this in the past.\n\nI feel somewhat trapped. Seeing how dangerous this stuff is with my Mom, I dread the thought of me becoming an alcoholic, but I also enjoy alcohol a lot and have so many great times with it with friends and family. I want to believe that willpower in limiting myself is the way to go, but I'm also starting to believe that due to genetics and other factors, I may not be someone who can do that. I know starting my job, and the 40+ hours a week that entails, will prevent me from doing 6 day binges like I was on before today, but I believe I have a problem I know I need to address.\n\nAny advice is appreciated.",

I\u2019m still able to sleep well, just incredibly nervous.\n\nThe anxiety gets worse when I think of the severe WD symptoms, mainly seizures. I\u2019ve never had a seizure but the thought of it terrifies me.\n\nWould I normally have to experience serious WD symptoms prior to a seizure? Such as uncontrollable shaking/sweating/vomiting. \n\nI know everybody is different, but I\u2019m curious as to how others have felt prior to a seize.\n\nYes I\u2019d like to go sober eventually, but still working on fighting the urge Friday night.\n\nThanks",

With my family and very close friends all because of alcohol.\n\nI\u2019ve struggled with my addiction to alcohol since I was 15. The first time i experienced alcohol, I also got high(on weed).. I was with two friends, one female and one male. During that, I was raped by my male friend as my female \u201cbest\u201d friend convinced him too.  \n\nI am now 29 and getting married in one week. I have yet to ever share this with anyone, but I do secretly hide my addiction to alcohol because of this.  Ever since then, I have felt numb to anyone and everything. \n\nI currently drink, and have ruined so many things. Even my brothers wedding a month ago. I can\u2019t even go into it. Even at my brothers bachelor party, I told his friend I wanted to fuck him. But why? I honestly don\u2019t know for myself.  I\u2019m engaged and getting married. I\u2019m so happy when I\u2019m not drinking. But I still want to drink. I don\u2019t understand. \n\nI want to check myself into AA, but the young 15 year old girl in me feels defeated. He won. I don\u2019t drink everyday. But I do drink any day that\nHas an ounce of stress, or if I don\u2019t drink all week I look forward to the weekend to drink bc then it\u2019s acceptable? Right? That\u2019s what adults do. \n\nI\u2019m so scared to lose my family. My friends. And now I\u2019m getting married, and want a family. The only thing is I can\u2019t even imagine getting pregnant and not drinking for 9 months. I don\u2019t want to harm my child, but then again I don\u2019t want to let my fianc\u00e9 or family down.\n\nI\u2019m a 29 y/o girl with everything any female wants in life. A house, a car, a huge beautiful wedding in a week, a fianc\u00e9,  But the only thing holding me back is my alcoholism. \n\nWhy is this such a hard battle. I choose the booze over everyone. And even if I changed, no one will ever accept or look at me the same.  So why stop now?",

I toss and turn, sweat buckets, feel hot and cold at the same time, etc.  Not to mention the other withdrawal symptoms.\n\nSo I like I said I went back after the first 2 weeks of last month but managed to drink only every other day.  I'm trying again now but it's so miserable.  I drank a fifth on Sunday evening, slept ok, got up Monday morning and had 3 beers to try to taper down a bit, and those were my last drinks.  But again, haven't had solid sleep at all since then, and actually I'm having withdrawal symptoms I haven't ever had before.  I had bad shakes on Monday evening and all day Tuesday as well as a super racing heartbeat and sweats all day not just trying to sleep.  I've asked doctors for sleep assistance drugs but they are hesitant to prescribe because they know my drinking habits and addictive behaviors.",

However, I used to drink prior to my heroin addiction ( recovered) and am an active AA Member all the same. I no longer drink and haven't since my twenties. I'm 33, and 5 months sober from substances besides prescriptions. Any ideas or tips on easy operation.  The thing is DUMB. It goes off every 5 minutes and I have to suck and blow...\nSuck and blow. I can hardly ever breathe hard enough due to asthma and have trouble with it. How am I supposed to drive distracted and operate that thing? I dont even drink! My duis have nothing to do with it....DUMB. they expect us not to text and drive, but to do this?!?!?! I'm definitely writing letters. I live in Wisconsin. Im on prescriptions and the cops harass me cause I'm notorious around here for my addiction.  It gives you 10 seconds to blow or else the horn starts going off, lights flashing, etc.... any tips on operation? Someone suggested zip tying it to my steering wheel column so I just lean over and blow suck blow while driving....so unsafe, but I see no other way! Please help me. How do I not attract cops? My prescriptions don't impair me at all. I'm just being harassed and given duis cause it's in my BLOOD. STUPID. That was my third. That's how it went down. Hadn't even taken meds that day. What do I do?",

It's creeped up again and in the past I've always felt this voice inside thinking I'll drink again eventually down the line. This time I feel I want to be done for good.\n\nI have had some depression issues that no doubt have been made worse by drinking. I started working out again as a means to give me some type of stability and routine as my job is night time oriented which opens up opportunities to drink.\n\nAll I wanted to get across is that I want to stick with it. I've read some advice on other's posts but if you have anything you can recommend or say please feel free to do so.\n\nI started by throwing about 50 old bottles 750ML I had accrued over a long period of time.

            "selftext": "Every time we get into a fight, my boyfriend gets really mad and tells me that when I get upset, my memory goes to shit. He says I twist things and exaggerate and make things up to fit the version of the story that I want, to help me win the argument and make him think he is wrong. He says he doesn\u2019t think I do it intentionally, but the fact that I do it at all is unsettling and the biggest flaw about me. It\u2019s the one thing preventing him from seeing a future with me. \n\nMy boyfriend has drank heavily every day for the past 4-5 years. There was a period of time when he would black out around 3 days a week, if not more.\n\nIs memory impairment like what he accuses me of a symptom of alcoholism? There\u2019s no way I\u2019m always wrong, right? There\u2019s no way my memory is always the one that fails? Does prolonged alcohol abuse do this to a person and affect them when they are sober as well?\n\nI\u2019m not saying my memory is infallible. I know I must be wrong at least some of the time. Maybe even most of the time. But it can\u2019t be all the time. Or maybe it can? He\u2019s actually cut back on his drinking a lot in the past couple months. I can\u2019t remember when the last time he\u2019s blacked out is, and he actually goes a day or two without drinking at all sometimes. But it seems like in that time, his temper has gotten worse. When he gets mad, he seems to hold so much contempt for me. He\u2019s actually said before (while mad) that he doesn\u2019t/can\u2019t give a shit about my feelings in the moment because he\u2019s so mad at me. \n\nI know I\u2019ve been a lot to deal with in the past, and I\u2019ve put him through a lot too. I can\u2019t help but feel like I did this to him. Maybe I did with my period of emotional instability. I know I have faults too, and I know I must contribute to our problems too. \n\nI have very clear memories of certain things that happened while we were fighting or he was mad. I have clear memories of him screaming at me and saying certain hurtful things and reacting in certain ways. And again, I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m never mistaken or that my memory is perfect. But there\u2019s no way I\u2019m misremembering every single thing that I think happened. There\u2019s no way every fight is my fault, is there? I mean he also has very clear memories of what happened, and he\u2019s not always drunk anymore when we fight. So maybe he\u2019s right and I\u2019m just crazy and manipulative and I need some intense therapy to help with my memory when I\u2019m feeling emotional. But please someone tell me alcohol abuse can do this to a person. Because if not, I have to come to terms with the fact that I may be quite literally crazy. And I really don\u2019t think that I am, but I\u2019m really doubting myself.",

            "selftext": "So I had my last group session today.\n\nThere were 11 people and no new faces.\n\nIt started with handing in our drink diaries and talking about our progress over the last week. As usual there were some tears and one guy had just lost his job.\n\nThe focus of this week was trying to bring together all the lessons from the previous weeks. We started off by discussing feelings which lead to drinking. We focused on three areas positive (where we start to think about what we desire from alcohol in that moment), permissive (where we think about justifications which allow us to drink) and finally uncontrollable thoughts (such as 'ive started so I may as well carry on').\n\nThen we did a group exercise where we were asked which of those categories a particular example fit into.\n\nAfter a break we went back over all the previous weeks, which I won't write about again here since my previous posts cover it in more detail.\n\nThe group facilitators handed out some certificates for the people leaving the group including me, and we got a round of applause.\n\nI had a sit down with my key worker directly afterwards to discuss my progress and next steps. We discussed how much I was drinking, and while it's still a lot it's a lot less. We discussed detox and said she would be discussing my referral on Monday, so it seems like she wants me to go. However, one of the things we talked about during past sessions is how to cope once you get out of detox. I don't think I have a good enough plan for this at the moment and was honest with her about that. Detox has been a big motivator for me throughout these sessions but I don't think I'm ready to go yet, I'll just get out experience the same triggers and relapse. She's going to refer me to another service and I'm also going to try mindfulness sessions at the centre, and I'll talk to my doctor about it next week as well.\n\nThe weight of that has been getting to me, and I was so stressed I went and got a drink immediately after I left and held it in my hands for a minute, before leaving to go to an outdoor gym for a little exercise instead. I'm not better yet, but I'm getting better.",

            "selftext": "My SO has, in the last few days, started telling me that he's having nightmares again. This coincides with him completely changing the way he communicates with me. It used to be that we texted CONSTANTLY and now he won't text me at all. Not once. Then he'll talk to me about whatever I texted to him when we get home at night. But he's ALWAYS on his phone playing a phone game and chatting on Discord - plus I noticed a text pop up from a new number that has no name assigned, which is strange for him too. I trust him completely, and I'm not worried about unfaithfulness, but I do think it has something to do with the drinking. He has been sober for a month, which isn't long in the longest ever, but it's a start. He went from like 8 beers every night to none. He's also not coming home on time. He gets off work around 3pm but is never home before 5pm. He says he goes for walks. I did check and I didn't find any AA meeting times that match this time. What should I do? He's intensely independent and doesn't take well to me prying. He tells me in his own time. The not texting thing is starting to upset me though. We only ever talk in the evenings now, and a good portion of that time is spent with him on his phone or us watching a movie. Not talking.",

            "selftext": "Not sure where to begin, I just want to speak my mind on the past year of drinking. I have only been to the ER twice in my life and the first time was for a broken arm. The second was this past weekend after what I only feel was more horrific than the thought of death. \n\nAbout a year ago I experienced the most agonizing feeling of dread and anxiety after a 3 day bender. I woke up in the middle of the night with a \"strange\" hangover. My entire body felt numb and my head was foggy (way more than normal). I felt a panic overcome me, so some dumb logic in my head said to \"drink water and run a mile\". I did this, got off the treadmill, and walked to the shower. Every step felt as if I was distant in my mind  controlling my own legs. This caused more panic. I sat in the shower, water running, and began shaking. \n\nI started drinking water by the gallon. I felt massive hopelessness, like I was out of my own body. I was confused and my mind felt as if it was melting. I had my SO take me to the nearest ER, but didn't go in. We waited outside, the symptoms of whatever I went through lessened, then we went home.\n\nOver the next few days, I stayed sober. However, there were aftershocks. My confusion felt strong for weeks after, the brain fog stayed heavy, and anxiety worsened. I moderated my drinking several days after, and was \"fine\" up until this weekend, where I went overboard like a year ago. I woke up Sunday morning to that same hell I experienced almost a year ago. This time however, I made it all the way into the ER. \n\nAfter Ativan and a IV bag, I began to feel better. The semi norm returned and my conciousness pulled closer from the void back into my head. This was decidedly the day I will truly go sober. I have made many disappointing and terrible decisions during this alcoholic life I've lead over several years. But sitting here, typing this out, and starting my new and true story with give me the faith and hope I need to regain my life, as well as the motivation to make everyday a challenge that is winnable. \n\nI pray that I can regain my cognitive faculties, a clear mind free of this \"fog\", lessened anxiety.",

I found out the guy I was seeing at the time was seeing two of my friends as well and we all had no idea of each other. It was traumatizing. An overall terrible event. That\u2019s what started my drinking of wine. \n\nThere have been a couple days here and there that I have stopped drinking throughout the years and could stop drinking for a week here and there, but it\u2019s now 2019 and I\u2019ve been drinking wine not to feel for a long time now. \n\nYesterday I woke up with really sore muscles in my hands and my thumbs were tremoring like I have Parkinson\u2019s. It\u2019s like both of my thumbs were really tired. My wrists were sore, muscles around my thumbs are sore, and I\u2019m up to two bottles of wine a night these days. That has only been going on since recently, and maybe for only two weeks or so that I\u2019ve been up to two bottles of red wine a night. \n\nI\u2019m 27, petit, 145. It hasn\u2019t affected my life to anyone on the outside yet. I drink because of my anxiety but I think the drinking is making me anxious and depressed now. I\u2019ve never drank this much up till this point, like two weeks or so. And I already know mentally I\u2019m drinking for the wrong reasons. \n\nI guess what I\u2019m asking for is support, because I\u2019m just scared and haven\u2019t wanted to admit that maybe alcohol is my problem in life these days, but mostly I just want to know, if I were to be an alcoholic, am I going to have DT\u2019s since I\u2019ve been drinking since 2016? It\u2019s never been more than wine, but I have a huge tolerance now. I just don\u2019t know if my heavy drinking has been going on long enough for me to have DT\u2019s. Reason I\u2019m asking is because I\u2019m ready to stop. The hand tremors scared the hell out of me and I don\u2019t want to lose my life. I\u2019m just afraid if I stop I will have DT\u2019s, and I don\u2019t have health insurance because I was recently laid off. So I just want to know that I\u2019m safe to stop",

I will feel much better if I feel like I\u2019m not in this alone, because that is how I feel right now. I also don\u2019t want to quit alcohol, I just wanna be able to be a responsible drinker, like a normal human. Not an alcoholic. I don\u2019t want to go to AA or rehab because then my secret will become public, and I will fall into a greater depression and probably lose some loved ones because this has been an on going thing, and has been a problem for some time (and they don\u2019t even know how bad it is) please help me",

            "selftext": "# Supplements for People Who Are Stopping or Significantly Reducing their Alcohol Consumption\n\nThese are to help you feel better, faster.\n\nFor men who have consumed more than 14 standard drinks per week for more than 6 weeks in a year, and for women who have consumed more than 7 standard drinks per week for more than 6 weeks in a year.\n\n## Supplements for frequent alcohol users and past frequent alcohol users\n\n**General deficiencies induced by alcohol use over time**\n\n- B-complex (for first month after reducing alcohol intake). Benefits: memory, mood enhancement, energy. [1](https://academic.oup.com/alcalc/article/33/4/317/129640)\n\n- Thiamine aka Vitamin B1 (for first month after reducing alcohol intake). Benefits: concentration, energy, muscle functioning. 100mg 3x/day or 300mg once per day. Benfotiamine preferred instead of Thiamine Hcl due to greater absorption. [1](https://rebelem.com/should-you-prescribe-oral-thiamine-for-chronic-alcoholics/), [2](https://academic.oup.com/alcalc/article/31/4/421/145739), [3](https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh27-2/134-142.htm), [4](https://examine.com/supplements/vitamin-b1/)\n\n- Folic acid (for first month after reducing alcohol intake). Benefits: Memory, avoiding sleep disruption, avoiding muscle pain. \"When supplementing folate, use up to 400 DFE (400 mcg folate)\nWhen supplementing folic acid, use up to 400 DFE (200 mcg is taken on an empty stomach, 240 mcg if taken with a meal)\" [1](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM197109232851301), [2](https://examine.com/supplements/folic-acid/)\n\n**If you get Insomnia after reducing alcohol intake**\n\n- Melatonin (0.5mg per night, 30 min before bed). Benefits: sleep. [1](https://examine.com/supplements/melatonin/)\n\n**Strengthening your liver**\n\n- NAC \"750 \u2013 1,000 mg, once a day.\" Benefits: Liver health. [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4728225/), [2](https://examine.com/supplements/n-acetylcysteine/)\n\n- Milk Thistle take 150mg \"twice a day, for a total daily dose of 300 mg.\" Benefits: Liver health. Important: Don't take milk thistle before drinking. Take it before sleep if you're sober, otherwise wait until the morning, and if you can't control your timing, avoid consuming milk thistle. [1](https://journals.lww.com/jcge/Abstract/2003/10000/Silymarin_Retards_the_Progression_of.13.aspx), [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3959115/), [3](https://examine.com/supplements/milk-thistle/)\n\n**Reviewed and not recommended**\n\n- Magnesium\n- Emoxypine (http://photos.imageevent.com/diydefense/awakebrain/MexidolPaper.pdf)\n- Ashwaghanda (useful dosage likely too large)\n- Vitamin C\n- Agmatine (Promising but more research needed. Also, don't take at the same time as alcohol) 250mg once per day. Benefits: reducing cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Don't take Agmatine before drinking. Take it before sleep if you're sober, otherwise wait until the morning. If you can't control your timing, avoid consuming agmatine. [1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166432899001278), [2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009130570700233X), [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10809167)\n- Piracetam or Noopept. Beneficial but best to wait until alcohol consumption is close to zero due to the potential for interaction with alcohol. Noopept may be preferred. If noopept \"take 10 \u2013 30 mg, once a day\" for 30-50 days after stopping alcohol intake.

I was arrested after throwing a out 3/4 of it down real fast. I guess in hindsight it was a suicide attempt and it may have been successful if I wasn\u2019t arrested. I got bailed yesterday with a no drinking condition but here I am in the morning on my third pint, less than 100m from the police station. Haven\u2019t slept in days. Don\u2019t let yourself get to this situation. If you are drinking too much get help before it\u2019s too late. Also open up to your partners before they leave you and those close to you. Yes it will take work but the rewards are there. If your partner leaves you because you are in denial and being an abusive drunk it\u2019s a very slippery slope.",

            "selftext": "Last Saturday my husband had been drinking all day at the pool so he is shit faced..again! We go home with our 2 kids(6 girl/7 boy)and my niece(4girl). The girls are asleep on the couch and my son is in his room. My husband is in the garage which is right off the livingroom where the girls are. \n\nAround 10pm i hear another mans voice in the garage and he is being belligerent. Im in the kitchen when the garage door opens and the man comes in with his loud voice. I turned to them and said get out of here now, they just stood there so I said..get the fuck out of here NOW! They both go back in the garage. I text my husband that he needs to get rid of his friend. An hour later my husband and this friends climb in his truck and leave. We have a location app on our phones and he turned his phone off when he left. Around 2am, i hear commotion in the garage again. I listen at the door and hear a womans voice this time. I open the door and see the man with a woman and my husband standing in my garage. At this point, i see red! I walk out and tell them both to get off my property. The woman asks if i recognize her from the 7-11. I do and she says she was at the bar for a drink and noticed my husband and could see that neither of them could drive home. Fine, nice and all, but she wasn't sober either. She drove the mans truck to my home and needed to get back to her car. \nAt this point, the man keeps coming at me asking what he did, whats the problem...I said DO NOT EVER come to my home drunk. He wanted to argue. I did not. I said you have 5 minutes to get off my property. At this point he says..you remind me of my fucking cunt wife. Now I dont know this man, only met him once before. He is from my husbands new month old job. I laughed and told him the words from the mouth of a drunk 50 year old man mean nothing to me. Then i said you have 3 minutes. My husband is standing right there, trashed bobbing back and fourth. Now the man is calling me a fucking bitch blah blah..i just keep counting down. At one point he wanted to come at me, and being a bigger gal, ill take a punch in the face to throw some trash in jail. He does nothing but ends up getting in his car at 30secs. left, and drives away. Now this woman, is standing in my garage, she gets an uber and I ask her to wait on the endge of my property for them. I am done with drunks.\n\nSo that was that...i had one job that night and it was to keep those babies inside safe. Kids are never safe around drunks!\n\nNext day, husband is disgusted in himself..blah blah..so i ask why he just stood there when a 50 year old man called his wife, and mother of his children a fucking cunt and bitch, he said he was too drunk and would have just started a fight.\n\nThing is, I cant get over the fact that he still goes and works with the man and shoots the shit. He said they both agreed they shouldnt have been drunk like that at our home. But, when i go through everyone i know and exs being in that situation with me, they would have all said something and stood up for me. Im so disgusted that i feel like my husband wanted me to be talked to like that or that he is just such a coward he didnt stand up for me.. i just cant get past it..\n\nI said you know what would have changed the whole night...if you would have been sober!!\n\nMy last straw is here...we were doing the only drinking on weekends thing but now we are at no drinking at all..we all know how well that works!!\nWhat a pussy though..im a woman and wouldnt stand there and let a man talk to a woman like that!!",

I had to lower the price 50k to stay competitive because I literally cant afford to keep it any longer and there are almost 20 *buildings* that are getting finished in the next year in my already bubbly market. Mine was priced at 49 on the 100 and all the other units were 15-48. I cant even make rent this month in my new place and it looks like i got blacklisted from my on call job because I asked for 10 days off(and they agreed) to finish the final push with cleaning/organizing/renovating. Its been like a year and a half since i quit with two relapses and if i had any money i probably would have relapsed last night. Im going to call my psychiatrist and see if i can get an  emergency supply of diazapam to stop me from drinking but its not like thats easy given my addictions lable. I know its first world problemsy but taking a 20% hit on your worth overnight sucks if you are worth $10 or 10million and having all those units open up at the same time took my take home from 250k to 200k or less. Every time i see a real estate add my pulse  jumps.",

By heavy drinking I mean almost everyday, and typically 4 shots pretty close to each other.  Some night varied (like if I went out or was at a party). I started recently reading into health risks with alcohol, and I\u2019ve kinda made myself panic. I don\u2019t have any strong symptoms of anything, but I did notice a couple weeks ago that the bottoms and corners of my eyeballs had a little bit of yellow. I\u2019ve never really had super bright vibrant eyes, they\u2019ve always been kinda dull and dingy, but I never payed close attention to see if this is something new. I also have really bad allergies and such so not sure if that could cause anything. I think they\u2019ve started to clear up a bit. I\u2019m just overall curious about what others think. Could I have harmed my liver in this one year to a point of no return? \nAny thoughts are appreciated, thanks!",

I\u2019m not sure if I would consider myself an alcoholic because I really haven\u2019t drank all that often, but the five+ or so times I have have been alone, to extreme excess, and with the express purpose of getting crazy fucked up/passing out. This is over the course of about two or three months. I certainly could easily fall deep into it and already see concerning thought patterns relating to it. It\u2019s something I\u2019m working on and improving with.\nHowever, even though I\u2019m getting better at beating back urges, I still have found myself getting into my car to go pick up some alcohol. Usually, by the time I\u2019m actually in the store and getting it, the urge has mostly passed and I\u2019m able to think more logically. For some reason though, I still get it, go home, and drink. Even though by this point, especially by the point of being home, I\u2019m able to think much clearer, I still can\u2019t seem to actually act on it. It feels like I\u2019m in autopilot, and I don\u2019t know how to stop it. Is it just a matter of willpower? Why am I doing this? Does anyone have feedback/strategies/etc?",

            "selftext": "This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons. Nobody knows that I have alcohol depency. Not even my husband. I'm f23 and somehow I became a pro at keeping secrets. Until now. TLDR at bottom.\n\nIt started with a glass of wine after long work days. This was never a big deal in my family. My parents are wine snobs. A glass turned into two or three. Which turned into a bottle a night. Then I realized it was great for anxiety and socializing too. So I started taking shots before events. Even the ones that didn't make me anxious. Eventually I just started taking shots in the morning on empty stomachs to 'get through the day'. Not eating all day then coming home to a bottle of wine. I even started adding vodka to my waters to drink at work. I have been drinking from dawn to dusk for about 3 months now. Wine and any kind of hard liqueur you can think of.\n\nMy eye opener was nearly losing my job two days ago. I was really early to work. Wasn't paying attention to the clock. I had a bit of time to kill. I went to the supermarket down the road and picked up a small-mid size bottle of flavored vodka. Poured it into a travel coffee mug and got started. I was out late the night before with a relative who recently ended her marriage, I told myself it was just hair of the dog. Work was enjoyable and I helped many customers. My coworkers let me take first lunch. Mistake. Grabbed my mug, went to my car, then I started hitting it hard just cause. I even refilled my mug. This is straight vodka we're talking. \n\nLunch was up and I clocked back in. I was really feeling it. But I didn't feel that I was acting any differently. In fact I felt more productive. About an hour after I had returned from lunch, I was called into the office. The floor supervisor said there was a customer complaint and that I was being sent home for the remainder of my shift. I had had enough that the alcohol wasn't even my first assumption. I spent the drive home crying and wondering what I did. Hindsight: that's how fucked up I was.\n\nIt was the weekend so my husband was at home when I returned. I just collapsed into the stairs crying hysterically and told him how I was sent home and they wouldn't tell me why. He comforted me the best he could although he was concerned. He said it wasn't that great of a job anyway and I could always find another if they let me go. I was grateful for his comfort but secretly started to wonder if it could be my drinking. \n\nI had to pull myself together quickly though as I had my other job to get to. Photography. I had a family shoot in the park. Put my makeup back on, got changed, and headed out. Mug was still in my car, and this time I said, I need it because I'm scared and had a bad day. Kept drinking. We exchange hellos and get started shooting as soon as they pulled up. I barely even remember the shoot. I was lucky that my camera settings were on point because I never even bothered to change them for the duration of the session. The alcohol worked in my favor for one thing only. The kids. They were giving me high fives and full of energy and I was able to run with it. What was going to be a half hour shoot turned into an hour and a half. I didn't notice and they were going with it. I thanked them for the shoot, they paid me, we left. \n\nThe drive home I was scared. I saw that I had managed to take great pictures, but I was having difficulty driving. My head was spinning. I called my husband since I missed a call from him. He said that he wanted to go for a drive by the apartments we were moving to in a few weeks. I made it to the house and got in his car. A few minutes in, I blacked/passed out. I was so tired from the drinking and crying. He knew I'd had a long day so it wasn't strange to him that I fell asleep in the car. I vaguely remember driving by the complex. On the way back I was feeling sick. I don't remember saying anything I just remember him asking if I was going to puke and I shook my head yes. He pulled over and I hurled relentlessly. Straight acid. He asked if I had eaten and I said no. We went home and he brought me dinner. I devoured it. And passed out again. He assumed it was stress and fatigue.\n\nThe next day was my reckoning. At this point I knew what I was going to be in trouble for but I hoped it wasn't. Sure as shit, the floor supervisor had smelled the alcohol on my breath after lunch and called the manager. Not a customer complaint at all. I lied and said that I hadn't been drinking on the job but he must have smelled it from the night before. She accepted it saying that he had mentioned that, and I got a write up for policies sake and given that I'm an excellent employee. I almost lost my job though and I'm pretty sure my coworkers didn't buy the story, though it was a half truth. Now I'm the elephant in the room when I go into work. \n\nAs for my husband, I gave him the same story. I said it was hair of the dog. He was really disappointed that I would risk it at all. And he was concerned for my health but he encouraged me to move forward from this and learn. Without him I know I would never have the strength to quit. He's too important.\n\nI just can't believe I let it get this out of hand. Getting drunk at work, risking relations with my own clients, my own husband. I need help. I'm lucky they didn't just fire me on the spot or call the police. I am determined though to quit. Today will be day one. It has to be.\n\nTLDR- Vodka is destroying me. I got drunk at work. Got sent home. And risked my relations with my photography clients. I even risked my life and others. I almost lost my job but they love me as an employee so I got lucky. I have to quit.",

            "selftext": "When I\u2019m (f/22) with my friends or on my own in my apartment I tend to fuck up, maybe 2x per week on average I accidentally get fucking obliterated and make a fool of myself.  I\u2019ve passed out on a street corner alone in my own vomit and then woken up across town in my apartment unsure how I got back.  Like I\u2019ve never started drinking with the goal to black out and be a nuisance, but also I don\u2019t need to drink every day.  When I\u2019m in a group and everyone is drinking I find it really difficult to abstain even if I consciously do not want to drink that day.  I get confused though because when I\u2019m staying at my parents\u2019 house or I\u2019m somewhere where I can\u2019t get alcohol (like when I spent 2 weeks in a Muslim country), I don\u2019t crave it and am typically fine not drinking.  But especially after prolonged breaks, when I then have an opportunity to binge, it\u2019s bad.  I just don\u2019t really understand my tendencies, since if I\u2019m with my parents I can have a drink or two and stop and am in control, or if drinks are expensive I can stop myself but if I\u2019m in my house with a bottle, I usually finish the bottle.  Not always, but usually.  I get in this zone when I start binging where it doesn\u2019t feel like enough ever, but I don\u2019t always get to that place.  I guess I just am not sure how valid my problem is compared to others and if it would make sense to seek help.  I\u2019ve posted here before in a post binge guilt fueled manner, but still am kind of on the fence.  I guess I just don\u2019t have a lot of experience with this sort of thing and am looking for input.  Thanks.",

None of my friends knew me to be a drinker and all of a sudden I was acting like this hardened and experienced drunkard, which felt awkward so I guess shame kept me doing it mostly alone. \n\nThen a bunch of other personal things happened that gave me more excuses to drown myself in a bottle... and I haven\u2019t stopped.\n\nFast forward to the fact that almost every night I will drink a 1/5 of rum (it\u2019s made in my city and extremely cheap).... if I buy the small bottle to try to control myself I will just go get the bigger one later and then have drank both. \n\nI\u2019ve always been healthy.

I also cant even hold a conversation anymore without a drink because I lose focus. Most of my time sober now I spend alone in bed thinking of all my regrets and mistakes. Ironically, I feel anxious and depressed about embarrassing things I've done while wasted, which is largely why I keep drinking.\n\nI was just wondering if any fellow musicians dealt with the same thing. Got any tips on dealing with alcoholism why being an active musician? It feels like half the scene are alcoholics and/or drug addicts themselves which doesnt make it easy. I feel like Ive gone beyond many of my friends though, since my drinkings frequently excessive and daily. Its having a huge negative impact on my mental health.

It got me thinking as I begin to navigate this with my boyfriend (maybe?)... what are ways that your family helped you become sober? Helped you realize what was going on? \n\nWhat are some things they did that definitely didn't help??  \n\n\nI'm trying to identify some of my codependent habits that affect my relationships in and out of alcoholism, and I was just curious your perspective. \n\nThank you.",

            "selftext": "I made a throwaway account for this.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m starting to resent my sister. We\u2019ve never exactly got along since we are completely opposite people. I\u2019m (15f) more shy and reserved and she\u2019s (18f) more outgoing and loud. She\u2019s recently started to get more into alcohol. Its always bothered me that she does those kind of things, but it\u2019s her life so I can\u2019t say much about it. \n\nRecently, it\u2019s gotten really bad. A week ago she came home super drunk and threw up all over the place. My parents had to take care of her and clean up the mess. The day that happened my parents and I had plans to go to someplace nice. Obviously, we couldn\u2019t leave her alone for very long so our plans got cut short. That made me upset, but I know I can spend time with my parents some other time so I got over that quickly.\n\nHowever, when my sister sobered up I couldn\u2019t look at her the same. I know this sort of thing has happened before with her but I had never actually seen it till then. It was really bad. She was yelling and screaming at our parents, throwing up, and just being a hysterical mess. Words cannot describe how awful it was to see. \n\nThis incident completely changed my view of her and in turn our relationship. And the worst part is that she doesn\u2019t even remember it. She knows that it happened but doesn\u2019t remember the full extent of it. \n\nI had a talk with her after, but it left me more frustrated than I was to begin with. The talk consisted of her not talking responsibility for her actions and justifying her wrongdoings. She apologized but it didn\u2019t mean anything to me. She only felt sorry because I was mad at her. \n\nNow I know I should \u201cbe supportive\u201d of her since she has an issue with substance abuse. But I don\u2019t think I have it in me anymore. All I\u2019ve ever done is be supportive of her. And has she ever been supportive of me? No. I can\u2019t even home a conversation with her without it turning into an argument. She tries to convince me that I\u2019m the problem. I get along with everyone else, and she gets along with no one. So in my mind it\u2019s clear who the problem is. \n\nAnyway, any advice on how to fix my relationship with (or if it\u2019s even worth fixing) would be very appreciated.\n\nTL;DR: My (15f) older sister (18f) has an issue with alcohol. After seeing her be a violent mess while drunk I cant look at her the same. Wondering how to fix our relationship (or if it\u2019s even worth fixing).",

Although this would play into my hands to allow me to keep drinking, I think there comes a point where I need to admit what my wife can\u2019t in that I have a drinking problem.

No matter what we say or do she refuses to talk to us about it when shes sober, and yells and locks herself in her room/passes out when shes drunk. She'll start to drink the moment she wakes up some days, drinking all throughout the day no matter what happens. I've had to cancel plans with friends too many times because of this. Occasionally she'll drink while she works from home too. I'm tired of throwing this under the rug. The moment shes finally sober, we all act like nothing ever happened and I'm sick of it.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I understand that she's been through a hell of a lot, and because of recent personal events, old feelings have resurfaced. I painfully understand that if she doesn't want help, then she won't get it. There's no arguing with an addict. But enough is enough.\n\nI'm tired and sad and I want to go to sleep without wondering which mother I'm going to wake up to; wondering if today is finally the day that the empty promises of the night before might be full, real, true promises. That I might be able to hear 'I love you' without thinking of it as an apology and an excuse. I want to be able to cry again. I want this numbness to go away.\n\nI used to talk to my friends about this (not super comfortable talking about this kind of thing with my dad, and obviously not my mom) but due to unfortunate events that involved my mom getting drunk in front of my friends, I cant do that anymore without feeling immense guilt and sorrow. It's been six months since then, and they have no idea that she continues to drink. I can't get in contact with my therapist any time soon. I feel empty and numb and so alone. I want to be able to walk out of my room and socialize with my own family without my anxiety clinging to me.\n\nIs there any way that we can get through to her? We are desperate at this point and I want to be free of this burden. I don't want my brother growing up thinking that this is what a family is, that this is *okay.* It's probably already too late for that. Anything you can give to help is appreciated.",

Benzos were my main problem, but the alcohol was still a major issue.  \n\n\nNow I'm slightly lost with what I should say to people. When people ask me how long I've been sober for, I have no idea what I'll say. I'm just lost about it. It seems pretty defeating to say I have only been sober for a few days, when I was sober for 140 days before it happened?   \n\n\nHow do people view this, what advice does anybody have?

            "selftext": " A commonly asked question here is what to actually *do* to stop drinking. This is a long post that gives a list of things we can do to help ourselves followed by an explanation of exactly how each of these helps. It is copied/pasted from my blog and the formatting might not paste successfully, in which case you can read it [here](https://lyingminds.sixboats.co.nz/2019/06/02/what-to-actually-do-and-why/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStopping drinking is hard. If you ever hear anyone say it isn\u2019t then they either don\u2019t understand the challenge or they\u2019re trying to sell you something. It is so hard because it is not actually alcohol we are fighting it is our own minds\u2026 so the challenge is essentially precisely as capable, creative, devious and persistent as we are. It is our own minds that create the cravings and the lies and it is our own minds that create our emotions and biased memories. Stopping drinking is difficult but it is not impossible; lots of people manage to do it. But while treatment programs tells us how important it is to stop and urge us onward they offer very little direct help on how to achieve this.\n\nWhat is compiled here is a list of things we can do to help break free of alcohol. These are things that have worked for me personally and things I have seen work for others. It is presented in two parts; first, what to do, and then, why it is effective.\n\n1.Don\u2019t have alcohol in the house. If you buy alcohol you will drink it\u2026 so don\u2019t buy it. Don\u2019t go into bars or restaurants that sell alcohol, don\u2019t go into liquor outlets or anywhere else you can buy alcohol, and especially don\u2019t go near the places you used to drink. Don\u2019t even pull into the car park of any of these places.\n\n2. DON\u2019T PICK UP THE FIRST DRINK. Do anything at all to stop yourself from picking up the first drink because the first drink dissolves all objections to having another. If I don\u2019t have the first drink, then I can\u2019t have 10! This is the new truth\u2026 \u201cOne is too many, ten is not enough\u201d.\n\n3. Get help. Go and see your Doctor and be honest about your problem. Take all help available, including craving medication.\n\n4. Prepare your defences along these 3 lines: delay, distract, deny. \u2013 Put off having that drink until later. -DO SOMETHING instead of sitting thinking about drinking (use the list of jobs). \u2013 Deny yourself the possibility of drinking even if your resolve has collapsed (e.g. give keys, cash, cards to someone else).\n\n5. Have lots of things prepared in advance that will occupy your mind and hands. Use them when the cravings come on hard. Simple books and puzzles probably won\u2019t cut it as at first as we can\u2019t maintain enough concentration through the roaring of our minds\u2026 physical \u201cdoing\u201d is good though. Make a list of jobs that need doing; tidy something, pack/unpack something, move stuff, dig, weed, sweep, clean the inside of the car\u2026 anything that keeps hands and mind occupied.\n\n6. Radically change your daily routine and most especially fill up the slack times when you used to drink. Plan to be doing something else somewhere else at these times. Make a commitment to them and turn up.\n\n7. If you are somewhere and you can see drinking and feel it pulling then leave immediately before it grows stronger. If you are going to somewhere where there will be drinking then be accompanied by someone who knows you\u2019re not drinking and prepare an exit route so that it\u2019s there if you need it.\n\n8. Have sweet things and snacks handy and have alcohol-free drinks handy.\n\n9. Be kind to yourself\u2026 you deserve treats and alcohol is not \u201ctreats\u201d. Alcohol is not a reward it is a punishment. Alcohol doesn\u2019t make things better. If alcohol was actually making bad things good then there wouldn\u2019t be a problem that needed fixing. Treats are rewards that your brain recognises, it will give you dopamine and serotonin as rewards and this will make you feels better.\n\n10. Take deliberate time to exercise every day. Do somethings that gets your heartbeat up for 10 mins or more. This releases endorphins and these lift our spirits. It doesn\u2019t matter at all what the exercise is so walk uphill, jog, use an exercise machine, go to a gym, use stairs\u2026 anything that gets your breathing hard.\n\n11. Keep the horizon close: \u201cforever!\u201d is self-sabotaging. The target is to not drink for the rest of the day\u2026 that\u2019s all. \u201cI\u2019m not drinking today\u201d Tomorrow and the days after haven\u2019t happened yet; they don\u2019t count. Today is the only day that matters. Now is the only moment that matters.\n\n12. Make yourself accountable by telling someone/other people you are doing this.\n\n13. Find and engage in some sort of recovery community, online or face-to-face. Other people have done this and can help you, but not if you don\u2019t connect with them. Here is good, so check in daily, face-to-face is more powerful but not necessarily available to everyone.\n\n14. Your head is going to tell you lies, so expect to be lied to. Recognise and call out the lies as them as they come. You are doing this \u201cbecause this is what has to happen\u201d. Stopping drinking is the only way to stop all the bad stuff happening.\n\n15. Plan a timetable to keep all of this up for 30 days because by then your brain will have significantly re-adjusted to life without alcohol. Both the problem and your ability to fight it will have changed by then.\n\nYou are still here and you are still kicking\u2026 so make the kicks count. Keep on finding out what works for you and what doesn\u2019t. Abandon things that don\u2019t help and keep looking for new things that do. Keep doing the things that work. You don\u2019t need some super-human super-power to be able to do this. Lots of people do this, and these people are not super-high-achievers, they are ordinary, normal folk. You can do this\u2026 the only thing preventing you is what\u2019s coming from your own brain. Take charge of that: recognise it, and correct it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat follows is why each of the points above is important to do and how they help.\n\n1.Don\u2019t have alcohol in the house\u2026\n\nAll of the things listed under this heading relate to the same issue: the intensity of cravings. There are two things that make a craving more intense. The first is drinking in response to a craving. This increases the intensity of the next craving to come from that trigger. The second is closeness. The closer we are to the circumstances of a trigger then the more powerful a craving it induces. A glass of wine immediately in front of us raises a far more powerful craving than one that we know is 1 hundred paces away, and that is more powerful than one we know is 1,000 paces away. The closer we are to the circumstances of a trigger the more powerfully it insists that we drink.\n\n2. Don\u2019t pick up the first drink\u2026\n\nThere are multiple reasons why taking one drink is disastrous. The first and obvious one is that as soon as we have taken a single drink then we have failed to meet our intention\u2026 to not drink at all. If we have already failed to meet that intention then there is no reason to not have another. Secondly if we have had a drink then we have put ourselves in a position where we are guaranteed to be triggered again, and powerfully triggered\u2026 we have placed ourselves where alcohol is close by (see 1). Thirdly, taking that drink altered our mood. On taking the first sip we got an immediate and powerful sense of relief wash through us (dopamine does this, not alcohol). Our minds immediately tells us \u201cthat was good, do it again\u201d. This is completely real and it is completely true. That drink DID make us feel better. We are more relaxed, happier, less alone and less anxious\u2026 so we should have another. Fourthly there is a mental process called \u201cdelay discounting\u201d. Essentially this says that we prefer a benefit now over a greater benefit later. In evolutionary terms the advantage this gives is this; if we see an apple in a tree we should take it now. Tomorrow, or the day after it will be bigger, juicier and riper, but someone or something else might have taken it before then\u2026 so take it while it is available. Closeness not only applies to distance, it applies to time. Being sober has its benefit tomorrow, not today. Delay discounting, like all other characteristics, is expressed more strongly in some people than in others and in addicts delay discounting is very strong. So in the face of two competing triggers; the benefit of drinking now vs the benefit of NOT drinking now, the benefit of drinking now is the stronger so it is the one that prevails.\n\n3. Get help.\n\nIf we could fix this problem using our own resources then we would have done so a long time ago. We have characteristics that favour addiction, but we also have characteristics that dis-favour recovery. Alcoholics are hugely self-reliant and favour our own opinions over authority. We also absolutely hate personal failure. These characteristics are complete barriers to us accepting help. We must fully accept that we do not know the answer to this problem. We have tried and tried, but we don\u2019t know how to beat it. Only when we accept that we have completely exhausted our own resources do we become open to ideas from elsewhere. We have to absolutely acknowledge that on this particular subject we are novices; we do not know the answers, and we do not have the solutions\u2026 if we did then we wouldn\u2019t be in this mess. Alone we lose! We have to make ourselves open to receiving help. Be bold, and step forward. We have to overcome our own hesitancy, prejudice and pride-of-self and acknowledge that this is a problem we don\u2019t know how to fix ourselves. We have to give up to win. We have to set pride aside and go and seek the answers from those that have them.\n\n4. Prepare your defences along these 3 lines: delay, distract, deny.\n\nThis is all to do with an essential feature of cravings\u2026 that they are not permanent. Cravings rise to a peak of intensity and then fade. The evolutionary basis for this is simple. If there is an apple in a tree then it will draw us more strongly than an apple in a far distant tree. But if that apple in the nearby tree is just beyond our reach then there is no point in continuing to demand that we seize it\u2026 otherwise we would stand under the tree and keep on jumping up to try and grab it until we collapse from exhaustion. If we can\u2019t actually gain the thing we are seeking then we should move on, that is the more successful behaviour. So cravings are evolved to have limited duration. When we know this we have some powerful information to work with.\n\na) Delay\n\nCravings have limited duration. If we can endure them then they will fade and disappear. This is the basis of the advice \u201cthis too shall pass\u201d, but as advice goes this one isn\u2019t the greatest. There\u2019s another psychology maxim that says \u201cwhat we resist persists\u201d, and it works like this:- while we are mentally fighting the craving we keep it present in our minds. When we sit thinking about alcohol we make the thought stay longer\u2026 we keep triggering ourselves. Sitting and enduring cravings is painful. It will work, because the craving will still come to an end at some point, but it is exhausting. There is a mindfulness technique called \u201curge-surfing\u201d which works by allowing the craving to flow without fighting it\u2026 you let the craving go past without concentrating on it, thus shortening its duration. It works if you do it, but won\u2019t if you don\u2019t\n\nb) Distract\n\nWe don\u2019t have to be physically in the presence of the circumstances of a trigger for it to fire; imagining a trigger will do exactly the same. The key piece of knowledge here is that our minds cannot distinguish between a trigger that is seen, smelled or heard, from a trigger that is imagined. To our subconscious mind everything is real and everything is now. Cravings have limited duration, but they also don\u2019t form nice orderly queues and we can experience more than one at once. Problems beget problems; that is how the mind works. If we dwell on about something then our minds find similar circumstances to see if they are related and can bring the issue to a conclusion. If we are sitting enduring a craving then we sit thinking about a drink. This brings in other thoughts about drinking and boom! \u2026 we launch more cravings. If we want to avoid all these additional cravings being launched then we need to prevent ourselves from dwelling on the first one, and a way to do this is to fully occupy our minds so that there is no spare capacity for our current drinking thought to expand into. Tasks that require physical movement as well as concentration work well so any manual task will work. The task only needs to last longer than the craving and distraction works really well at keeping the cravings short, but we need to be able to summon the presence of mind to be able to do it.\n\nc) Deny\n\nWe overcome cravings by repeatedly experiencing them, but then not drinking in response to them. Every time we resist a craving then the intensity of the next craving launched by that trigger is diminished. It doesn\u2019t matter how elegantly or otherwise we avoid drinking in response to the craving, what matters is that we experience the craving and then don\u2019t drink; that is how we make them lose their power. When delaying and distracting have failed there is still the possibility to deny. We can organise to deprive ourselves of the means to get alcohol even when resolve has collapsed. Like the other options this only has to work as long as the cravings last, after that we regain control once more. Every craving overcome is progress regardless of how it is achieved.\n\n5. Have lots of things prepared in advance.\n\nThis is to do with distracting ourselves during cravings, but we can make it achieve far more with a little thought and preparation. When we are hit with a huge craving (or group of cravings) then it is difficult to concentrate on organising a distraction. We can\u2019t focus sufficiently to work out what we could do, gather together what is required to achieve it, and then set about the task. But we can do all that thinking in advance. We can also do ourselves another favour\u2026 we can not only overcome a craving, we can improve the way we feel within ourselves. We all feel time-poor. We feel like there\u2019s not enough time to do all the jobs we need to get done. We have jobs that have been outstanding for days, weeks, months and years. These outstanding jobs nag at us, but when we finally complete one of them we get a sense of deep satisfaction. These are the things to list and prepare for. We need jobs that occupy our brain and hands, but they don\u2019t need to be sophisticated\u2026 all they have to do is seize our concentration. Jobs like; cleaning, tidying, mending, making, and organising are all good. We need to write a list and then have the things already in place that are needed to complete the job; materials, tools, utensils, equipment etc. This way, when a demanding craving comes on we can go straight to the job without needing further thought or preparation. When we do something that demands our concentration then we prevent cravings from building on themselves. If we make that activity something that is worthwhile then it will also give us a much needed bloom of self-worth.\n\n6. Radically change your daily routine\n\nThis is to do with cravings, but more importantly it is to do with resolve fatigue. Fighting off cravings is exhausting. The cravings are seemingly endless, but our ability to fend them off is not; resolve is finite\u2026 but it is ultimately all we have to fight cravings with so we need to manage how we draw down that limited resource. Ultimately we need to take the power out of our drinking triggers. We need to knock down the power of the cravings by overcoming them, but we can\u2019t beat them all at once. If we try we will exhaust our resolve and be overwhelmed. So we can deliberately reduce our exposure to them. The aim isn\u2019t to avoid cravings; we must confront them one day, the aim is to spread them out more. In the early days we are going to get triggered by almost every part of our daily routine, but there are parts of that routine that we can change. We can directly target the times of day/week that we most often used to drink as these times have now become vacant. We can deliberately plan to distract ourselves at those times. We can also choose those things to be activities that will make us feel good about ourselves; helping someone else, working on our health, completing worthwhile projects (knocking some jobs off the list in item 5) and so on. When we do this we lift how we feel about ourselves as well as reducing the toll taken by cravings\u2026 there will be enough of those as it is!\n\n7. If you are somewhere and you can see drinking\u2026\n\nIf we get close to alcohol then we will be triggered to drink. There is no way to avoid this it is an entirely automatic function of the brain. The long aim is to be able to move freely in a world awash with alcohol, but as we first set out we risk our effort being overwhelmed if we sit with alcohol directly in front of us. In time we will knock the power out of these cravings, but initially the single most powerful drinking trigger we have is being in the presence of alcohol. Being in a place where alcohol freely is available is our most powerful trigger, so it brings on the most intense cravings. Cravings are like waves; they rise to a peak and then subside. We make cravings lose their power by not drinking in response to them, but a craving doesn\u2019t have to reach its maximum before we deny it\u2026 we can short-circuit the problem. We know that the craving will pass, but we also know that the intensity of the craving is related to how close we are to the trigger. If we are in a situation where there is alcohol available and we feel it pulling hard then we can make the craving subside by moving away from it. If we have someone with us that knows we aren\u2019t drinking then we can give them the authority over us to intervene on our behalf if we leave it too long to take this action ourselves; they can steer us away. If we need to escape the intensity of the cravings then we need to be certain we can gain distance from it if we need to. This is why having and escape route prepared is also so important. If we cannot get away from the triggers then we risk exhausting our resolve and succumbing to the cravings.\n\n8. Have sweet things and snacks handy and have alcohol-free drinks handy\n\nYour brain requires that alcohol should be in your hand. If you have something else there then then there is no vacancy for the alcohol. It is that simple. Have a drink in your hand and no-one will offer you another\u2026 then that trigger will not be fired. \u201cHungry\u201d is perhaps unexpected, but it also a drinking trigger. One of the things that happens when we become alcohol tolerant is that our flight-or-fight response is cranked up, and our flight-or-fight response changes how we want to eat; it makes us seek food and drink that will give us a quick energy boost; surgery and fatty things. Alcoholic drinks are often high in sugar so these satisfy that urge but as they do they form a new drinking trigger\u2026 to drink when we are hungry. Being hungry launches cravings, so avoid it until you are able to fend it off. This is why having snacks available to immediately knock off hunger is important early on. But as with all craving-avoidance tricks this is only a temporary measure to spread out the number of cravings we encounter until the time comes that we can meet them head-on without depleting our resolve.\n\n9. Be kind to yourself\n\nDrinking gave us an artificially induced lift in our mood. At first it made us happy, and it made us more socially engaged. Then when we became alcohol-tolerant we felt unhappy and alone when sober and alcohol relieved those feelings. Sure, as our condition advanced we only got a lift from feeling \u201cmiserable\u201d to \u201cok\u201d but it was a lift nevertheless. But once we stop drinking we also stop receiving that artificial lift in our emotions and this leaves a gap in our lives. We need to do something about this, otherwise we will find ourselves constantly hearing \u201cit isn\u2019t worth it!\u201d and this is one of the ideas that will completely destroy our resolve; there\u2019s no point whatsoever in going through all the struggle of stopping drinking if it is going to leave us miserable for the rest of our lives! The mood lifting chemicals that alcohol causes to be released are dopamine and serotonin. These give us feelings of pleasure, contentment and sociability. If we are to fill the void left by alcohol then we need to work to deliberately do things that provide these three things\u2026. otherwise we will feel that we are missing out on life because of our abstinence. We have extra time in our lives when we stop drinking, so we can use that time to do things that make us feel better like these; listen to your favourite music and crank it up, eat a favourite food as a treat, have sex, just relax, have a designated chill-time, take a long bath, get into sunlight, get into nature, find places with distant horizons, meditate, use touch therapies like massage or a cold blast at the end of a shower, celebrate victories!\u2026 jump, dance, shout, recall happy occasions, do something with others (children, family, or pets), do things that make you smile and laugh, or smile just for yourself. All of these will cause a lift in dopamine and serotonin release.\n\nWhatever it is we do is up to us but it is important to deliberately do something every day that lift our mood. We do this to avoid alcohol leaving a gap that we long to go back to.\n\n10. Take deliberate time to exercise every day\n\nWe get far, far more from exercise that we expect. We can use exercise to deliberately occupy a time that we know will otherwise be triggering, or we can do it simply because it is good for us. Exercise raises dopamine and serotonin levels, and we know we need to raise these to fill the void left by alcohol, but it also releases endorphins; another of the brain\u2019s feel-good chemicals. Endorphins are the brain\u2019s natural stress relievers. If we exercise in a group (a team sport or a group class for example) then we not only get the lift from the endorphins but we also get a lift from social engagement. The last great benefit we get from exercise, whether we do it alone or with others, is that we feel good because we are doing something to help ourselves, and we need this quite badly. After prolonged drinking our self-image is appalling, and doing something that improves this gives us a great and enduring lift. If we exercise for no other reason then we should do it for this one: it makes us feel better about ourselves, and we desperately need that!\n\n11. Keep the horizon close.\n\nThere are three ideas that will completely collapse resolve. One has already been mentioned; \u201cit isn\u2019t worth it\u201d, and this item is about the second: \u201cIt is impossible!\u201d If we look into the future then we can\u2019t imagine not drinking on certain occasions; birthdays, Christmas, family celebrations and so on. We quite simply can\u2019t conceive being at them and not drinking, so we convince ourselves that we can\u2019t not drink. Keeping the horizon close limits the challenge to what we know we CAN achieve. We know that we can go a day without drinking\u2026 we\u2019ve done that plenty of times on the back of a horrific hangover or after doing something appalling. So we deliberately limit our thinking about drinking to the very near future, we do not allow ourselves to look at the distant future. If we catch ourselves in the future then we need to bring our minds back to the present. The challenge is only to not drink for the rest of the day. I don\u2019t have control over the future. The only moment I have control of is right now, and right now I don\u2019t drink.\n\n12. Make yourself accountable\n\nWe hate failure, so being accountable raises the pressure on us to achieve what we have said we will do. When everything else has fallen aside we still have our own pride and that might be the final thing which stops us from picking up that drink. We can make ourselves accountable in many ways; to those close to us, to a doctor or therapist, or to recovery groups (in-person or online). The loss of pride from having to acknowledge failure in front of these groups or individuals can sometimes be the thing that stops us picking up a drink but it can also be a terrible double-edged sword if we do drink. The other way that we can help ourselves with accountability is related to time that we spend alone. When we are out-and-about and alone we are entirely reliant on our own resources. This is time that we would easily slip a few drinks into. The challenge here is that \u201cno-one will know\u201d. But if we have a sober companion then we can make these potential drinking opportunities inaccessible. It is a way of denying ourselves opportunities to drink. We can tell someone where we will be at all times; how long we should be gone, where we are going, when we should be back etc, Tell them your phone will be turned on and invite them to call you.\n\n13. Find and engage in some sort of recovery community\n\nOvercoming addiction is a battle of attrition. The battle isn\u2019t fast, we have to gradually grind the enemy into submission, and the effort this requires is enormous. Ultimately whether we drink or don\u2019t drink is determined by our strength of will. We have to raise sufficient will to even want to try. We have to raise sufficient will to overcome the four challenges of cravings, a biased memory, mood, and lies coming from our minds. And when we have found sufficient will to overcome these we need to maintain that high level of determination for weeks before the challenges start to lose their power. We have to find sufficient resolve to overcome the challenges, and we have to to maintain that resolve for a long period. But there are three things that will completely destroy that resolve: if we doubt that it is necessary, if we doubt that it is worthwhile, or if we doubt that it is possible. We have to believe that it is possible, that it is worthwhile, and that it is necessary; these are the basis of our resolve. This is the foundation on which our recovery is built, and a failure of any one of these will bring down our effort. We need other people to help us build the resolve necessary to engage the challenge, and we need other people to keep our resolve sufficient to keep on fighting. This is what we get from being engaged in a recovery community. In a community we are directly presented with the evidence required to confirm the ideas that underpin our resolve; that stopping drinking is possible, worthwhile and necessary. In a community we can engage in dialogue and satisfy ourselves that the problems faced by those that have stopped were the same as ours. We can see that they have become well, and we can see that life has got better for them. Recovery communities hold the evidence we need to believe that recovery is possible, and worthwhile. Engaging with recovery communities builds the resolve needed to get going, and staying close to them maintains and replenishes that resolve. Recovery communities is where we get evidence that this is what we should be doing, evidence that it is worthwhile and possible, reassurance that our efforts are in the right direction and will yield results, guidance on what to do next, and encouragement to keep going.\n\n14. Your head is going to tell you lies\n\nOur brain seeks to make sense of the world and what we experience; to understand it. But cravings to drink come as only feelings and these are disassociated feelings that have no supporting rationale. Our minds require information to be orderly, so they create a rationale that validates the feelings: our minds automatically make explanations that make sense of the cravings. But the cravings are products of a mis-performing reward system; they are intense feelings that should not exist. The feelings are real, but they are incorrect; they should never have reached the intensity that they have, and they should have equally balancing drink-avoiding emotions like revulsion, disgust, disinterest etc. However, the false feelings come and our minds then create plausible explanations for them. But these explanations are for invalid feelings, so the explanations are invalid too. The explanations, justifications and excuses are all created in response to incorrectly generated feelings\u2026 they are misinformation. When we know this then we can acknowledge them as they come, and this works very powerfully for us. When we recognise the justification as misinformation then we do not need to argue with it, we can just dismiss it. This stops the false justification from lingering. When we anticipate the lies and dismiss them they lose their persuasiveness. If we keep dismissing the lies then after a while our brain recognises that we are rejecting these thoughts and it stops presenting them to us.\n\n15. Plan a timetable to keep all of this up for 30 days\n\nWe have to maintain a huge effort until the most commonly met cravings have fallen in intensity to no longer be debilitating, and we have to maintain our effort until the effects of becoming alcohol tolerant have significantly reversed themselves out. When these have happened then both the problem has diminished and our ability to fight it has increased. But to do this means that we have to maintain a huge effort for at least several weeks. We need to plan to get through this period without completely depleting our resolve or it will certainly fail us and we will drink again.\n\nThere is no silver bullet when it comes to addiction. The condition is complex and there is no simple fix; we need to meet challenges on many fronts and we need to keep our resolve intact so that we can keep fighting. It takes time but progress is steady and it is there if we will only look for it. The things listed here will all help, but one will help above all the others. That one is \u201cFind and engage in some sort of recovery community\u201d. This is where we will find the tools to help ourselves, and this is where we will find the resolve to keep going. But critically, if we fall then this is where we find the strength to get back up again.",

            "selftext": "I have been off of stimulants for 9 months, and off of alcohol for 7 months. My problem was an addiction to stimulants that I will never take again, but shortly after getting off stimulants, I also gave up alcohol and convinced myself was convinced I was an alcoholic. I did 90 AA meetings in 90 days and started working the steps. \n\nFast forward to today, AA has given me so much and really helped me be a better person, and realize I don\u2019t need stimulants to feel normal. My abstinence from alcohol helped me overcome social anxiety by going on dates, meeting new friends, speaking publicly, all without alcohol or stimulants.\n\nI also had a ton of extra time to get back into my hobbies and see a psychologist and a psychiatrist to work on therapy and medication (currently on anti depressant SSRI) .\n\nI am 26 and was having the hardest time going on dates, and just ordering coke and then explaining that I wasn\u2019t drinking. The girls would get disappointed and also order something non alcoholic which I felt badly about. And then of course there the questions about why I don\u2019t drink after 2 dates. \n\nSo I went on a date with this girl last night who I had really awesome conversation with leading up to it. We clicked well, and when I picked her up she was beautiful. On the drive to pick her up I was contemplating ordering O\u2019Douls (non alcoholic beer) so that we could avoid the whole awkward mess of me explaining sobriety.\n\nWe sat down, looked at the menu and I saw there were no non alcoholic beers, so i quickly just ordered the lowest % beer on the menu. She also got a beer and enjoyed it. We stayed there for 3 hours eating pizza, and each had 2 beers. I didn\u2019t get drunk or tipsy, I just had them so that I could avoid an awkward discussion. And I have no desire to drink now today. I do however have an immense guilt (writing this out is helping) about breaking my sobriety. I have met so many great friends in AA, and my mom even started going to AlAnon when she saw I was really active in AA. I feel like everyone in my life will be let down by what I did. I don\u2019t know who I should or shouldn\u2019t  tell. The date was the best date I have ever been on.\n\nI\u2019m going to talk to my psychologist about it and see what he thinks. I also will be seeing this girl again and will tell her that I really do not drink at all and I\u2019m sure she will be cool with that.

My drink of choice was a bottle of wine every other night and sometimes more. \n\nI am in a situation where I cannot get to meetings but am in therapy and have an AA sponsor by phone. \n\nI struggled recently (for like a year) with alcohol again. It was due to a new health issue and I just broke down. This time as I am quitting I am finding it very hard. Yesterday was day 6 and it was awful. I have been prescribed valium but still feel very anxious. The fatigue and brain fog are horrid and I felt really shakey (not like shaking hands but a vibration throughout my body). Is this normal and how long does it last on average? I normally by day 6 do not feel anything but some irritability, slightly increased sadness and not sure what else-but nothing intolerable.\n\nInput appreciated. Thank-you.",

            "selftext": "To start this off, I am by no means a stranger to living with alcoholism. I was raised by an alcoholic father who would routinely say pretty horrible and abusive things to me when he was drunk. At its worst, he was hiding bottles of half finished vodka around the house. My mum once found them and tried to get him to own up to it, but instead he blamed the bottles on me, his teenage daughter, saying that I had probably left the bottles around the house. He did many other things under the influence that were terrible and I won\u2019t mention here, but needless to say growing up in that environment left a lasting impact on my psyche. \n\nMy boyfriend and I have been together for five years. When we first met, I was attracted to him instantly - he was funny and smart and in great shape. We had similar interests. He supported my hobbies and passions and took an active interest in them the way no other person I\u2019d dated had done before. We had great chemistry and an amazing sex life. I fell in love hard and fast. \n\nMy boyfriend has always loved a drink. His primary way of socializing with \u201cthe boys\u201d has always been going out and getting as fucked up as possible. This never seemed a problem to me - he was always with his friends, and this behavior seemed really normal for a young guy in his early 20s. It never impacted on his ability to go to work or to function in society. \n\nAfter we moved in together, three years ago, things started to change. Or at least, I saw them differently. My boyfriend was drinking every night - a glass of red wine, or two, or more, and always alone. He bought the cheapest thing on the shelf, so it was clear he wasn\u2019t doing it for the taste. I asked him about it, and he told me that it was all about relaxation. He liked to have a drink to \u201cunwind\u201d because his job was really stressful. He never saw it as a problem. I\u2019ve never been a huge drinker, and by contrast I barely drink anything. Over the years, whenever I\u2019d question his drinking, he\u2019d argue that drinking every night like he did was actually normal, and I was the weird one for not liking a drink at the end of the day. A lot of my friends and family, who aren\u2019t problem drinkers, have a glass or two of red wine most nights too. So based on this, I believed him. I believed I was strange and he was normal. He knows about my past, and his other defense has always been that I\u2019m overly sensitive to drinking because of my alcoholic father. I don\u2019t know what a normal, healthy relationship with alcohol looks like, because I wasn\u2019t exposed to it growing up. I believed this too. For years. \n\nIn order to make the relationship work, we agreed to make some compromises. My boyfriend promised not to drink spirits - just beer and wine, and only with dinner or on weekends. He made it clear that he was doing this for me. That he didn\u2019t think it was fair, but he was willing to make this sacrifice because he loved me so much and I have \u201cthis weird hang up\u201d about drinking (again, until today, I really believed he was right). This seemed fair. Spirits were what my dad drinks, what I associate with problematic behavior. Beer and wine was fine, right? Being aware of how much he had to drink was healthy. It was all under control. \n\nSix months ago, we made the decision to move overseas together. A new adventure. I was really optimistic about this as I thought the change would be good for both of us. And it was. Our relationship felt like it was stronger than ever. For the most part, I\u2019ve been happier in this relationship than I have been in a long time. \n\nPart of why I was so excited about the move was it meant my boyfriend would finally be leaving his old job, the cause of all the \u201cstress\u201d that he blamed for his nightly drinking. A new job that was less stressful would eliminate his need to drink, I thought. He has a new job now, and apparently it\u2019s just as stressful as the last. He is back to drinking every night again. If I try to criticsise it, he makes me feel guilty. He works so hard, and here I am, nagging at him and trying to take away the one thing he enjoys. The same old defenses come back - I\u2019m too sensitive, my point of view is fucked up because of my dad, I don\u2019t understand drinking. He is normal. I am wrong. \n\nAbout a month ago, while cleaning out our closet, I found a half finished bottle of vodka hidden in the back. My heart sank. I felt physically sick. I confronted him about it, and he acted shocked. Told me the bottle couldn\u2019t possibly be his. He had no idea how it got there. One of our house guests must have left it there. I wanted so badly to believe this was true, so I convinced myself to. We\u2019d had a lot of friends come to stay with us on weekends lately, many of whom drank, so it was plausible one of them could have left it there. Never mind that said friend would have had to leave it stashed right at the back of our closet, then, while staying. Never mind I had been with those friends practically the entire weekend, and didn\u2019t remember seeing them buy vodka. \n\nShortly after that, my mum came to visit us, and the two of us went away for a week or so on holiday, leaving my boyfriend home alone. The day we got back, about midday, I could tell something was wrong. He was talking more and louder than usual, slurring his words, making inappropriate comments. I wondered if he was drunk, but tried to argue against it. It was the middle of the day. I couldn\u2019t smell alcohol on his breath. He was just tired. I didn\u2019t say anything because my mum was there, and if she noticed, she didn\u2019t say anything either. \n\nThe breaking point came earlier today. He\u2019d gone out to the hairdresser, leaving me home alone. I cut myself shaving in the shower and was bleeding a lot, desperate to find a bandaid. I opened his bedroom drawer, thinking he might have one in there, and my heart sank. There, right in front of me, unavoidable, was a half finished bottle of vodka. The sickness feeling came back. I sat on the bed naked, wet, bleeding, for god knows how long. Reality finally came to call, and there\u2019s no escaping it now. \n\nThe bottle in his bedside table has to be his. The bottle in the closet has to be his. He has been hiding the extent of his drinking from me, for who knows how long, and lying to me. Blaming it on me and my flaws, just like my dad used to. This whole time, I\u2019ve never been wrong. My view of drinking isn\u2019t all messed up because of my past. I could see the signs for years, but he managed to manipulate me and convince me I was the one with the problem, not him. \n\nI didn\u2019t know what to do. I got dressed and went downstairs. Sat and started writing this post. He came home from the shops and noticed something was wrong. I lied and said I was sick. He\u2019s been so kind and nice to me. Made me some tea and some lunch. Told me how much he loves me. \n\nI\u2019m no closer to knowing how to handle this. I can\u2019t live in denial anymore, I have to confront him and tell him I know. I have to start the conversation, but I\u2019m terrified. Terrified because I know I can\u2019t live through this again, because I don\u2019t know if I believe he can change. Because I\u2019m worried he is going to try and deflect again, and I don\u2019t know how to stay strong against that. \n\nIf you\u2019ve made it this far into this story, I would love to hear any experiences of dealing with a loved one who has a drinking problem. How do I help him? Can I even help him? I\u2019m in a foreign country with no friends, no resources, no help. Nowhere to go if I have to leave. And I have no idea what to do.",

            "selftext": "For context we have been together for almost 2 years. 6 months ago his drinking got out of control and he lost his job for it, almost lost me, and basically destroyed his life. His family helped send him off to rehab for 30 day in patient facility. Then 3 weeks after living in sober living I decided he could come home. I told him if he picked up a bottle again, then that would be the last of us. \n\nHe's 32 and has been an alcoholic most of his life since he was about 16. How bad his drinking is has fluctuated alot in his life, but hes never managed to stay more than 3-4 months sober at most. He is also the kindest and most loving person I have ever met in my life. Hes funny and cute and overall an amazing partner and spectacular human...when hes sober. I love him so fucking much it hurts. I wanted us to get married and have kids, the whole shebang.\n\nLately hes been super depressed (hes struggled all his life with depression) and recently his cousin was staying with us for a few weeks while he is looking at moving to our area. Lifes been shitty all around for both of us these last few months. Work sucks, family problems, moneys tight, lots of problems overall but we've always had each other. \n\nHe smokes weed sometimes to help with the drinking cravings, I am not a huge fan of him smoking but I figure it's better than him drinking. Also I am a stoner and feel like a hypocrite telling him to not smoke when I smoke almost every night. \n\nToday I had some plans for us, wanted us to go to the forest and have a picnic and relax in nature. I figured it would be a good mental health relaxation time and would be nice and romantic for us. He was acting weird all morning and when I wanted to go, we got into a fight. He said be got \"too high\" and doesnt want to go. I didnt remember him smoking so we fought for a bit and I accused him of relapsing (which I sort of have a few times in the past week) he denied it and we fought some more and eventually got over it. \n\nLater we are watching a movie and he decided he wanted to go out to smoke a cigarette and left really abruptly (after getting upset over some minor stuff) I chased after him and couldn't find him for a bit. Eventually he turned up in an area I already checked and he made up some bullshit answer for why he wasnt there earlier. \n\nWe smoked and he talked about how he feels like a failure and how he cant do anything right in our eyes. Went on to talk about how hes super suicidal and depressed and only living for me and his parents. All this made me very concerned and worried and figured he had relapsed. He kept denying it and said hes so close to 6 months sober (2 days) and how he hasn't sabotaged himself like he normally does etc etc etc\n\nHe went back to the apartment and I just knew that he relapsed. I checked the areas where he normally hide vodka, couldn't find any. Searched the laundry facility, nothing. I eventually found an empty water bottle under the stairs. As soon as I saw it I fucking knew it was his...\n\nHis normal MO for drinking was vodka in water bottles. I had found many before when he was actively drinking. I really wanted it to be just an empty water bottle, but when I smelled it, that familiar scent hit my nostrils like fire.....it was vodka.\n\nI went back up to the apartment and passed by his cousin without a word. He was laying in bed, I told him he could cut the act and come clean, I had found the water bottle. He denied it, saying it wasnt his. But I could see it in his eyes, it was his. Eventually he fessed up and told me he relapsed 10 days ago, but then he quit again...until yesterday. \n\nThe next few hours are a blur, I called his family and mine and told them what was going on. Packed a bag, yelled at him a lot. Cried alot. Broke some things, screamed, almost hit him. More phone calls to family, more crying.\n\nAt one point had a run in with a strange crazy (but super kind) old man at our complex and had a pleasant (and fucking weird) conversation. Really weird night\n\nRight now I am at a hotel while his cousin watches him. I am worried about him, afraid he might hurt himself or kill himself. \n\nMy heart is broken and my brain is fried. I told him if he drank again it would be the end of us because I dont want that to be my life. I've already self isolated from friends and become codependent in the relationship, and that was mainly because of his drinking and how much I love him.  I was tired of the lies, the deception, always wondering if he was drunk or if he was going to hurt himself or someone else while driving. After rehab it looked like he was really going to stay sober, finally reached rock bottom and he was ready to live his life. \n\nI know relapse is apart of recovery but over the course of 2 years hes tried to get sober and relapsed about 20 times. This was the last chance, the final straw. And he fucked up and dropped the ball. \n\nI am leaving him. I dont know the logistics of it all yet but I am not taking him back. Hes caused me so much pain and grief that I just cant do it anymore. I love him to death. Hes my best friend, my partner, and my soulmate. I dont know what I am going to do without him, but I know I cant stay with him. It kills me to write this, but I know it's the right thing for me. \n\nFuck, life sucks sometimes...",

However this isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve done this and always go back to drinking when I feel better. I\u2019ve been drinking on a nightly basis for 10 years now with only a few days or so without, usually only when I\u2019m so sick from the night before I dont want anymore. Lately things are getting worse and causing me and my gf to fight to the point where I get her upset and I just go to bed without even remembering hardly anything the next day. We both drink and usually end up overdoing it. She wouldn\u2019t drink if I didn\u2019t and is supportive of me quitting but it\u2019s not that easy. Today was a beautiful day but once again plans were ruined by being sick in bed and fighting from the night before. Also lately feeling pain under my right rib cage which has me worried about liver damage. I need to see a doctor for sure and plan to this week, but I know the demons of alcohol will try to get me again at some point. I\u2019ve made so many excuses to cut back (I\u2019ll only drink beer or premixed cocktails, I\u2019ll only have one or two drinks and stop, etc...). None of these work. I know I want it out of my life but it\u2019s a daily struggle. There is alcoholism in my family as well and my older brother is the one who pretty much got me into the hard stuff but I can\u2019t blame him or anyone for making my own decisions to drink. Anyways that\u2019s my story. Hoping to get this crap out of my life for good but I know I have to want to quit. It\u2019s really just nicely packaged poison in a bottle, but making myself  believe that and never forgetting what it has done to destroy my body and daily living is up to me I guess \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",

            "selftext": "I\u2019ve spent the last two days in a hospice room holding the hand of the man I believed was my soulmate for over 5 years. He is dying of end stage liver failure. He was a good, sweet, kind man, and he adored me in the beginning. Over time, it became apparent that he had been covering up his lifetime of alcoholism, and he deteriorated. \n\nWhen I say he was an alcoholic, I don\u2019t mean he drank a lot occasionally. Through multiple hospitalizations and one stint in rehab, I found that he had been secretly drinking a fifth of vodka a day for years. He hid his stumbling and slurring through jokes, his deteriorating digestive symptoms through claiming to have a new virus every couple of weeks. He argued and lied, and he denied, denied, denied. He slept through the days, and drank secretly through the nights. Even when confronted with a dozen empty bottles, and a dozen water bottles filled with his dark brown urine, he could only say he was sorry. He knew he was sick. But he said he couldn\u2019t stop. When his behavior became mean, defensive and demented at times, I ended our relationship over a year ago. We have remained best friends, texting every night, and I\u2019ve tried over and over to convince him to stop drinking. He\u2019s always claims he quit. \n\nTen days ago he was hospitalized, and he called to say he loved me. Seven days ago he texted me lovingly, joking for the last time.  Three days later his brother texted. Six months tops, and there could be no further treatment. He could go home to his mother\u2019s and stay there for palliative care to live out his remaining days. And three days ago, the hospital sent him to hospice instead. He is no longer conscious. He is in pain. His mother asked me to visit. I drove an hour and a half to the hospice yesterday.  He had not even moved in a couple days, and he never stirred the whole time I was there. I went again today, and though he was still unconscious, he rolled over to me to nuzzle my hand as I stroked his face and scratched his head, talking about all the good times and his loving family, who were all there. He tried repeatedly to sit up, eyes still closed, unable to speak. And as I held his hand, he stuck his arm straight up, apparently trying to pull me closer to him. He nodded each time I told him I love him. So I know he knows I was there. \n\nI am just heartbroken. I will go back tomorrow, and hug him until the end.  Love the man. Hate the disease.",

I didn\u2019t really drink socially or to have fun. I would just come home from work and get drunk as soon as possible and stay drunk until I passed out. My girlfriend of nearly two years said that she was growing, and I was stuck. My self hatred and the way I treated myself was something she couldn\u2019t be around anymore. So she left, and I haven\u2019t had a drop since.\n\nI\u2019ve contacted her recently to tell her that I made it a whole six months and admitted to her how much drinking I was doing that she wasn\u2019t aware of. I apologized for lying and thanked her for ending things with me; cause if she didn\u2019t I likely wouldn\u2019t have stopped.\n\nAnyway, just wanted to share.

I\u2019ve never posted here before, but reading y\u2019alls stories here and at r/stopdrinking have really helped.

She would come home drunk from work and she would hide day drinking from me.  \n\nArguements would come out of nowhere when she was drunk and the days after her blow out she would dry out for a few days.  But when she started feeling better she would start drinking again.    \n\nShe has gone through treatment once.  Ive been to a few aa meetings with her but it seems to be a cycle that she has been through about 5 times now in about 6 months.  \n\nI personally have never struggled with any kind if substance abuse.  I feel completely lost and have no idea how to help her.  I dont want to seem like im hovering or monitoring her but it can get tough when we have important things to do and i can tell pretty quickly when she has started drinking at 10 am.  \n\nAny and all advice welcome.

Couple of them kept saying, \u201cDon\u2019t you want anything? I got money. I\u2019ll buy you one.\u201d I just said, \u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019m good.\u201d One of them then said, \u201cAre you, okay? Did you do something. I just want to make sure you\u2019re okay.\u201d I have to admit I got a little annoyed bordering on pissed at that. I said, \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Her rejoinder: \u201cWell, then why aren\u2019t you drinking? Have one.\u201d I gave this huge internal *sigh* and said, \u201cNo, thank you. I\u2019m just not drinking right now. I don\u2019t feel like it.\u201d Bartender was also a friend and when my seltzer was empty he said, \u201cYou want something in that?\u201c\n\u201cYes, XXXX, seltzer, please.\u201d\nLooks at me askance for a moment. Then says, \u201cDo you want to do fireball shots? I\u2019ll do a couple with you.\u201d \nHuge internal *sigh*. \u201c\nNo, XXXX, not tonight.\u201d \n\u201cYou okay, Man?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m good I\u2019m just on the wagon.\u201d \n\u201cWell, let me know.\u201d \n\u201cThanks.\u201d\nThe woman I was with then said, \u201cYou look tense. It\u2019s because people are drinking around you and you\u2019re not. I almost said what I was thinking. By this point I was pretty pissed. I almost said what I thought out loud: I\u2019m tense because I\u2019m not drinking, TOLD you MULTIPLE times and ALL of you are STILL trying to get me to drink.  After ALL of all me I drink too much. I left shortly thereafter. \n\nWhat prompted this current bout with sobriety was something my oldest and closest friend said to me. I had talked with him before a party last weekend and he said, \u201cYeah, you\u2019re a drunk. You know what else? Your friends use you to point to because at least they can say I\u2019m not THAT drunk.\u201d So I went to the party sober. Was told by one of the guests that I was shitfaced; even though I was just drinking seltzer. \u201cSorry, XXXX, I\u2019m not.\u201d (He had been boozing, though) proceeded to try and  me that I was shitfaced again, \u201cI\u2019ve seen you shitfaced all the time. And you\u2019re definitely shitfaced.\u201d I just smiled and said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m not drinking today.\u201d At the close of the evening my host was definitely in his cups and said, \u201cLet\u2019s have a drink, I can\u2019t be the drunkest one here.\u201d I declined. So yeah, I saw the light: All of my friends have a shitty relationship with alcohol, too, it\u2019s just that it is easier to tell yourself that HE\u2019S a bigger drunk than I am, so I\u2019m okay.\n\nLooks like a new friend group is in order.\n\nTL;DR: Friends pressured me to drink. They have their own problems with alcohol and tried to make themselves feel better about their drinking by making me their scapegoat. I\u2019m going to be making new friends",

Bars and clubs were never my thing, but anything is fun if you're drunk enough, right? \n\nThese thoughts scare the shit out of me. I'm 22, I've got a little bit of sober time. I'm trying to remind myself that I'm a raging alcoholic, to put it nicely. Currently feeling pretty down.. trying to stop myself from saying fuck it lol. Being social helps. I need to meet new people and find new spaces where I can spend my time. \n\n So if anyone knows any meetings where a lot of young people typically go in the city, or maybe some events/organizations that host events for young addicts.. anything, really. Just trying not to isolate myself. Need to make some new friends. A sincere, big thanks to anyone who read this post. Good luck to you all.",

But he feels like he can't talk about Trump in meetings. Beyond anything political, my husband associates Trump with a triumph of his narcissistic mother's \"philosophy\" -- that intelligence and expertise don't matter, that empathy doesn't matter, and that narcissists have super powers to get what they want in any given situation and there's nothing anyone can do about it. But because AA is strictly apolitical, he feels like he can't bring up his feelings about Trump at meetings, and therefore stopped going two weeks ago.  \n\n\nAnyone have any advice on how he can process and move past his feelings about Trump? Solidarity with how he feels may also help. Thank you, and my heart goes out to anyone suffering from this terrible disease of addiction.",

All apart from my step mother readily admit to this fact but continue to drink and drink together. \n\nOf course, there are many horror stories I could tell. However that is not why I am writing this. I am looking for other people\u2019s perspectives to explain to me what it is that they get from alcohol? What is the motivation? What does it give people in return? Because I never have really been able to understand. \nI want to understand so I stop feeling confused and angry at my family. I am not looking necessarily to help them stop drinking, because I know that they need to want it themselves. \n \nThe purpose is to be able to become more empathetic toward them. I will eventually ask them for their own reasons - however right now I feel this would just send them into a shame spiral, to an anger spiral, back to a shame spiral. Which is a path we have been down way too many times. \n\nAny comments appreciated.",

But I do have a personal and family history of mental illness, and I tend to have an obsessive personality if such a thing exists. My parents have both abstained from drinking their entire lives, so I don\u2019t know much about their relationship with alcohol. \n\nWhat I do know from my first two years of college is that when I start drinking, I can\u2019t stop. I told myself early this past school year that I would stop drinking to excess because I noticed this pattern wasn\u2019t healthy and I was starting psychiatric medication that reacts with alcohol. So I haven\u2019t had more than one or two drinks in a night since last September. But recently I\u2019ve had cravings and been dreaming about drinking, so I don\u2019t know what to think about that. \n\nAll that to say, I\u2019m underage (20) so all this has taken place while my access to alcohol has been extremely limited. This summer, I\u2019m studying abroad in a country where I\u2019ll be of age, and most students in my program are talking about drinking together and will definitely do so somewhat often. I don\u2019t know what I should do. I desperately want to drink because I like the way it makes me feel and I want to be included with the rest of the group. I have moderate to severe social anxiety, and drinking always makes that disappear. People like me more when I\u2019m drinking. But I don\u2019t want to develop a habit while abroad that I sustain through the rest of college. I want to do well in school and I can see that dragging me down. \n\nIs it okay to let myself drink while I\u2019m abroad? How can I set limits for myself if others around me aren\u2019t doing that? Do I seem to have alcoholic tendencies, or am I just being irrational? I really enjoy drinking and I haven\u2019t let myself go in so long, and this seems like an easy and safe enough opportunity.",

I went back to drink, became very codependent and now that the relationship is over, I sit around feeling sorry for myself and if you asked me if I would be in this position a year ago, I\u2019d say there\u2019s no way. I\u2019d bet anything on it too. Now I\u2019m in this vicious cycle and I don\u2019t know how to break it. I tell myself \u201cI need the company\u201d when I\u2019m feeling alone and go to a bar then before I know it, I have no idea how I got so hammered. I feel like I\u2019ve lost passion, motivation, and drive and that feeds the cycle more and more. Has anyone been in this position but with some success? It felt easy when I quit before, now it seems like the hardest thing ever. Ive has some shameful benders and wake up with 2 day hangovers and say \u201cno more\u201d only to go out again. Where do I even start?",

            "selftext": "First things first, sorry about the length of this text.\nMy wife is 25 and is the middle sister of three girls. The youngest is 24 and has severe special needs, the oldest is 30 and is an alcoholic and has substance abuse problems. I am 31 and I used to have my own demons substance wise so I can recognise the patterns and I know from my own experience what helped me and what didn't.\n\nThe oldest sister has always worked in the service industry and managed a lot of places, so lots of booze and drugs about. She had a big problem with pills, weed and booze years ago but knocked the pills and weed on the head. We thought that was about it until we noticed how much she was drinking. We had an inkling but it was when she left a family holiday early with a whole handle of gin and apparently finished it off by the time she got home (maybe a two hour drive) that we realised the extent of the problem.\n\nShe has a pre-existing condition which caused her to go to the hospital and it turns out it was exacerbated by drinking. My mother-in-law had a chat with her and she stopped drinking. Unfortunately the owner of the last restaurant she worked at had found empty bottles in her bag when searching for emergency contact info and she got fired. On top of that she lost her apartment too so she moved in with her Mom. The conditions being that she stops drinking, gets another job and goes to therapy or AA. It seemed like she had for a while but it turns out she was stealing her disabled sisters meds and her step father's bourbon which he'd hidden away in the back of his closet (so it's not like it's out in the open for all to see.) She seemed to clean up her act again after he snapped at her but it's started again. Booze has gone missing and she smelled like it on a few occasions before our suspicions were confirmed. On top of that she's been using her mother's card (her Mom is off work on disability) to Uber everywhere and has been telling people she used to know that she's living the dream now and everything is fine.\n\nEvery time anyone tries to talk to her she shuts down. Based on my own experience, it was when my own behaviour was pointed out to me by my younger brother that I realised how low I'd sunk. I broke down and realised how deeply my behaviour had impacted those I love and I went and got counselling. That is what worked for me but I know that everyone is different and what worked for me might not necessarily work for someone else.\nHow do we convince her she needs help? She comes from a loving family who all see the best in her and we just want her to see that too. If anyone has any advice please go for it, we're kind of at our wits end.",

            "selftext": "I was socialized with drinking in the Marine Corps, I was in the infantry and we drank a lot. When I got out O was diagnosed with PTSD and Anxiety Disorder. I stayed sober for about a year and then move from California to Richmond Virginia.\n\nWhen I got to Richmond I started drinking, 7 years later I was engaged and it ended due to alcohol and I lost being in my step son's life. Since October I have been drinking a lot more. Switching from just beer to hard alcohol, beer, and recreational drug usage. In March I managed to not drink for 30 days. But I picked it back up and went even harder than before.\n\nMemorial day this year was particularly rough not having my ex and her son around and drank in the weeks leading up to it extremely hard. My mental health went down hill and I was contemplating ending my life. Saturday night some friend came and picked me up out of worry. All we did until Tuesday was drink.\nTuesday I called out of work from a hangover and drank all day.\n\nWednesday morning I woke up in a cold sweat, with shakes and anxiety. I was done feeling like this. I went to the Va hospital. Something told me if I didn't stop and start taking care of myself I would not live to see 40. I swallowed my pride and admitted my problem and was prescribed gabapentin to prevent seizures. I'm a day and a half, maybe more into my detox. I dont like the way gabapentin make me feel. \n\n I had stopped taking care of myself and doing chores. I had trash piled up in my room and cleaned my room today. My anxiety is through the roof and my depression is coming on pretty strong. I keep telling myself that as long as I live like the way I was my depression will never get better. I am close to financial ruin because of the life style I have lived these passed years.\n\nI told my parents what was going on and they dont think I can do it. All my friends drink and they just tell me to slow down, but I can't. I dont have an off switch and cannot drink responsibly. I lack much of a support system but I am not going to fail myself. I know I have to rebuild a support system from the ground up. \n\nHas anyone ever experienced something similar before, and do you have any advice. I do plan on finding an AA meeting once I am done with my gabapentin regimen.",

            "selftext": "Hello. Im 23 yo and I've been drinking alot since I turned 18. Im an introvert and shy, but when I drink it makes me social, too social. Some people think im a jerk even though I never use any violence or have any bad intentions, I just wanted to speak with people and have fun. Suddenly I noticed there was a beer in my hand more often and more often. I started to question myself and it got to the point that I started to steal my fathers drinks, puked in a bar, passed out in places etc. \n\nI went to minnesota-treatment last year in my country and thought that was my saviour. I was sober for 3 months and it was the longest time after I turned 18. I also did some AA and NA but relapsed after a breakup from a long relationship. It felt embarassing and I had alot of guilt from relapsing and instead of embarassment and guilt giving me courage to stop drinking again, I just want to drink more and forget. It's a never ending spiral. I just wanted to be social and likeable and have some confidence in myself. I haven't had a drink in 2 days and I don't feel well mentally.  I don't know why exactly im writing this here but maybe getting a bit of my story out there will help me with these feelings and thoughts. I need to believe in myself and know for a fact that im an alcoholic. \n\nAlcoholism is like a candle. When you start to drink again the candle starts to burn from exactly the same place it stopped burning.\n\nThank you for listening.",

            "selftext": "In my adolescence I was very innocent, didn't drink, didn't party, didn't do drugs, didn't have sex or know much about it, or even have any relationships (my first one was at 25). I didn't start drinking until I was 18 when I moved away for college. I'm 30 now. In my early 20s, I partied a lot. I was a bad drunk at times, often blacking out and throwing up. People thought it was funny and liked hanging out with me despite it and I even got my own party girl name (I have since tried to dissociate myself from this persona). I got kicked out of school for missing so much. Ended up moving back home because of all the irresponsible partying. \n\nNow the biggest problem is that I didn't know when to stop. I'd keep drinking. I'd always tell myself I'll be good tonight, but then I'd have more than I said I would. There were also times I became a different person when I drank - very aggressive and unfiltered and made stupid decisions (would run around a lot and disappear, got kicked out of several clubs and bars, but usually just for being unable to hold myself up). I think because I was so reserved while sober, I'd drink to help me loosen up but sometimes it loosened me up too much and I became an entirely unrecognizable person.\n\nFrom 21-25 I calmed down a bit. Still went out and partied but was responsible about it. Finished pre-reqs and got into a decent college again. I was even working out heavily and working on my fitness during this time and lost a lot of weight. Looking back, this was probably the most content I felt in my adult life- school, working out, and still had a nice social life.\n\nFrom 25-29, I did drink sometimes but I'd go for months at a time without it and was fine. There were a few times I blacked out but they weren't bad. And I really feel between 27-29 I had good control of myself when I did drink.\n\nAt late 29 I began drinking even on the weekdays after work, almost every day, alone. I am and was going through a lot emotionally so maybe that's why it started up again. This was the first time it would be done just to drink and not to go out and party - so that is a good indicator that something is off with me internally. I am 30 now and I don't drink on the weekdays anymore, thankfully, but my bf and I always decide that I won't drink anymore at all but then on the weekends we have an itch to. He's scared for me to drink because of how I get, but then he doesn't want to control me or keep me from having a good time. He tries to say ok, 3 shots or 3 drinks is the limit but somehow I end up having more. For the record, he does enjoy drinking with me when I don't get too drunk, and he holds his liquor well and never blacks out or acts out, but he gets scared of what I'll become if I drink too much, especially cuz in the end he's the one who takes care of me. A lot of times I lash out at him (I've kicked him out, yelled at him, etc but I do have a lot of resentment towards him for other reasons so I suspect that has a lot to do with why I started drinking again in the first place). I am really trying to stay away from it now, because it is affecting my finances too and we are in no position to be spending money for alcohol excessively.\n\nI am for the most part a responsible adult - I get to work on time, do well at work, still keep my apartment clean, still cook meals, still pay my bills and rent on time, still see my family regularly (although my family does have a lot of drinkers - some of them drink multiple nights a week, but they seem to have a good handle on themselves). But I know that for me, the drinking isn't just partying anymore and it's become something to help me cope with a lot of things in my life. I thought I had a good handle on it for those few years, but now it's back to the fear of being a bad drunk.\n\nI dislike this. I don't want to be like this. I really thought I was past this. I thought I was good with being able to control my liquor now.\n\nI really didn't believe I was an alcoholic.",

My s/o, who I have been with for almost 4 years, is currently in rehab. She had been hiding her alcoholism from me (we don\u2019t live together yet) for awhile and recently her parents discovered her stash and she admitted she had a problem and has been through detox and is now in rehab as I said. Tomorrow she will be 30 days sober!!\n\nI\u2019m extremely proud of her for stepping up and working on the issue. I love this woman and would be devastated if it had consumed her without me knowing. I write her letters and talk to her on the phone when she can call. She seems to be doing very well and has made it clear that she is putting in a lot of effort. She has been exercising more, which is great because she didn\u2019t a lot before, and has been talking about how much more open she has become and how much better she feels. I look forward to her calls every day and she is always on my mind. \n\nI was wondering if the people in this subreddit had any ideas for a gift that would be good for someone that had just completed rehab. She still has three weeks left or so.  I recently got a Fitbit and I love it and she has expressed a desire to exercise more so I was thinking she could get one and we could use them together so she would continue the new trend she developed in rehab. \n\nDo any of you have something that would have been helpful to you after you finished rehab? Or just anything in general. She expressed to me how helpful and supportive this community has been to her so I also just wanted to thank all of you for helping her. Any response is appreciated.",

It\u2019s wack because my life is feeling so together, like I just graduated and was accepted to an MBA program and I\u2019m super excited but I keep waking up, hearing what I did and just feeling physically and spiritually crushed.

            "selftext": "I have no idea how to feel right now .. so it\u2019s a long story but here it goes .. I just need advice on how to cope and if I did the right thing . So , I am a 24 year old female with a 4 month old son and a first time mother. 2 days ago on my day off from work I invited my sister over for dinner. She came over with her 8 month old son and her boyfriend. We all had some wine. All was well but my sister has a drinking problem for years and I noticed her sneak into the kitchen and down an entire bottle in a few gulps. I didn\u2019t want to embarrass her so I didn\u2019t say anything. We\u2019re having a good time cooking and watching friends. I only had one glass of wine and was totally sober. As the night goes on my sister goes from acting normal and great to extremely erratic and sloppy. She asks her boyfriend to go buy her cigarettes and once he leaves she starts screaming and sobbing saying he left her. She proceeds to run outside and scream running down the hall ways. It was so terrified and shocked because although she has a drinking problem she hasn\u2019t had an episode like this in a few years . I scream at her to get back inside and she comes in and I get her to drink some water and calm down. Next thing you know her boyfriend gets back and she then proceeds to start verbally threatening me for NO reason. She goes on to say that she wants to kill my son and that he will be dead by the morning. I kept trying to remind myself that she was blacked out drunk. I kept trying to wake her up. But she was too far gone. Next thing u know she continues to repeat over and over again that she has turned the gas on and is going to kill my son. At this point I get in her face and say \u201csis ! Do u know what the fuck you\u2019re Saying right now ?!\u201d And she continues with the terrifying verbal threats on my 4 month old. At this moment something switched in me and beat the living crap out of her , opened the front door and threw her outside and locked the door. As of now my family says I did the right thing but the only person making me feel awful is my mother. She claims my sister was just drunk and didn\u2019t mean it and since I was sober I\u2019m in the wrong. It jus terrifies me that she even has these thoughts in her head when drunk. She\u2019s been a great aunt and super loving but I\u2019m so confused where the hell this came from the other night .. if anyone can give me some clarity and insight please please do. I have been having such a hard time dealing with this. Thanks in advance",

However, there is a massive game on Saturday - the Champions League Final in fact, and I'm a big football (soccer in US) fan and these types of events have always been intrinsically linked with a beer or 12. Now, friends are telling me that I've done so well with my drinking that I could totally do a one off and pick up where I left off - I'm just unsure. It won't be the same with out a beer but I don't want to mess up my sobriety in the long term either. What are your thoughts? Is it possible for an annual beer with no negative impact when a person has alcohol misuse issues? I'm really interested in your thoughts/ experiences",

Going to rehab will cause me to lose my job and I can\u2019t afford to drink this much anymore. I have acquired some Valium to help me if I run out of alcohol. I\u2019m out of money and time it seems. I\u2019m scared of dying or having DTs if I quit. I can\u2019t sleep unless I\u2019m massively intoxicated. I have a lot of sleeping medicine prescribed to me but alcohol is cheaper and easier short term but long term it\u2019s killing me both physically and mentally. I don\u2019t have a support group or really anyone that understand what I\u2019m going through and I can\u2019t afford a therapist and I work too much to go to AA. I need some hope and guidance guys. I\u2019ve beaten smoking and narcotics, I know I can beat alcohol. But not without some help from veterans. Please.",

Everything in this town is booze based. Go to a ball game. have a few beers. Board game night with a few beers. Go to an art opening. Have a glass of wine. Wine tastings. Eating out. Go to a concert. Have some drinks. Any after work event is a bar mixer. Any event is focused around drinking. I've been trying to  go to events and stay sober but it's awful when I'm the only one not having anything to drink. I've been having a hard time sticking with AA and getting with the community there because of the faith/spirituality based core. I've tried to get past it but I can't get past the third step. I'm anxious, I'm lonely as hell, I'm becoming more socially isolated. I don't know how to socialize and be around people unless I'm drinking. I don't want to pick up a drink but i'm miserable.",

He's got a wife, kids, a good job, and a lot to live for. Right now I'm thinking that when he gets out I will not drink around him, try to support him as best as I can with non-drinking activities since I am an outdoorsy guy. But Ill also tell him that if he starts drinking again, Ill never speak to him again. Other than that I really don't know how to handle this situation, any advice is appreciated.",

            "selftext": "I had my fifth group session today.\n\nIt was ten people this week, only one new person. \n\nWe started with the familiar introductions. Some people were disappointed in their progress, mostly it seems because either they got some bad news or because there was a holiday this weekend.\n\nThe topic for this week was changing habits. We started with a group exercise where we identified internal and external triggers. Internal were things like anxiety and paranoia, external are things like advertising/marketing.\n\nThen we had a break. I had a quick chat with my key worker and she asked me how work was going and she told me it's my last week next week. I thought I had one more week tbh. She told me after next week we'll arrange a time to meet and discuss next steps.\n\nAfter the break we did another group exercise where we talked about how we identify cravings what effect they have and what techniques we use to help manage them. For example when I start to feel like I need a drink I'll tend to lose focus on what I'm doing. \n\nNext we discussed some techniques for managing cravings using terms from an acronym called SOBER.\n\nTo be honest I didn't feel as engaged as I have in previous weeks, I felt a disconnect between the people in the group and the group facilitators. For example, one of the facilitators was using terms like \"pick up\" and \"use\" which aren't really terms used in alcoholism.\n\nLast week next week!",

            "selftext": "Like I am now 8 weeks sober and a lot of my superiors are wondering why I never join them for drinks in bars anymore and are saying I should, even though my coworkes have told them I dont drink anymore., they still say that I should join them for a coke at least or say to me \"What\\`s so bad about one bear or one glass of wine\"  \n\n\nLike first of all, bars are a no go for me. Especially the run down rubble type of bars that only serve beer, shots and liqeur. Because I used to love them! Those were my favorite type of bars, I felt so comfortable there and I used to spend so much time there. Also you know what? Unlike clubs, restaurants, house parties and get togethers in parks, all you can do in a bar is drink. This is their sole purpose. So why would I go to a place like that ever again especially with my superior whoa re all awkward so I would definately miss the the alcohol.  \n\n\nAlso this whole \"One glass of wine wont harm you, I drink one glass of wine everyday and nothing bad happens\" is so annoyinng. Yes, you don't have a problem with one glass of wine or one beer, but I do. There is no such thing as one glass of wine or one beer for me. When I drink my first drink of whatever, I am already thinking about the next. Or people who say \"I don\\`t understand how you cannot stop after one?\"  Well, Bobby, I also don\\`t understand why you don\\`t shower, but I don\\`t say it now, do I?\"  \n\n\nAnyone else having to deal with those annoying things?",

            "selftext": "My best friend has always been a high functioning alcoholic and weed smoker. More so weed than booze. However in the last year or so, I\u2019ve started to see it spiral to the point that she\u2019s putting alcohol above everything else in her life. She\u2019s spending time with people who are serious alcoholics, and claiming their behaviour as acceptable. She has a 16 year old daughter that basically takes care of herself because her mother is constantly out getting wasted all the time. I now see that I need to have a serious conversation with her about my concerns. When I\u2019ve touched on it in the past, it doesn\u2019t go far. She\u2019s very intelligent and says that the reason she abuses drugs and alcohol is because she\u2019s so smart and informed and that normal people don\u2019t because they\u2019re ignorant and stupid. She has also scoffed at the idea of counselling because she\u2019s \u201cway smarter than any therapist\u201d. She also owns and runs a successful multimillion dollar business that I know she would have a hard time stepping away from. I\u2019m not sure how to go about this.  She lives 3 hours away, so do I make an impromptu trip there? I\u2019m assuming this isn\u2019t a phone call kind of conversation? And how do I get around all of her road blocks about being too smart for sobriety?",

I fought my way to a new life here in CO a few years ago. We had a rough childhood which led to drugs and drinking after my dad died ~16 years ago. I'm fortunate in that I struggled free and made a life for myself, but my brother never found that strength. Three or so months ago he hit another \"rock bottom\" in his meth/alcohol addiction and was rapidly approaching a point where he would either kill himself or end up in prison, so I offered him a sanctuary in my home with my wife and I. Gave him a month w/o obligations to get sober; he's been working for the last two months. The short version is that he has a wife and kids who need him to get sober and financially stable, but he refuses to face adult life. He was always \"Mama's little boy\" and never was allowed to develop into a proper mature adult, and was always enabled. Now he gets defensive whenever I try to suggest he do better.. my wife and I want our space back, and while he's a decent house guest, it's past time he tries to figure his shit out. I recently talked to him and told him no more alcohol was allowed in the house, thinking this would help inspire him to get sober... However he just stumbled into the house and told me essentially he passed out drunk in his car in the parking lot.. I don't know what to do. He refuses to go to AA, he always gets aggressively defensive whenever I try to tell him what to do, and his family is depending on him to get sober and get his shit together and I feel helpless... I don't want to get him into trouble but I don't know how to handle this situation.. PLEASE SOMEONE HELP ME SAVE MY LITTLE BROTHERS LIFE... of course there's so much more to all of this but I'm getting desperate... I don't want to flat out kick him out but he's not even trying to mature, seek help, grow, sober up, nothing..... I've shown him easy options for better jobs, I've given him suggestions on ways to get help but any time I try to go beyond \"suggesting\" things he shuts down and refuses to listen to me.... I don't know what to do...",

Maybe once a month. I recently drank so much wine on Saturday night and I\u2019ve been so poorly this week. We are now on Weds and I still don\u2019t feel right. My question is: have I done some irreversible damage? I feel sick, dizzy and zero energy. I have had to go back to bed multiple times and thankfully I\u2019m off work this week. I still feel strange today. Any help would be much appreciated thank you",

            "selftext": "So im 25. Id say ive had an alcohol problem since I was about 16 when I truly got into alcohol. I come from a line of alcoholics who ended up stopping drinking heavily at about 50. My alcohol use is about a pint of vodka a day. Here recently I got hit by a car while I was walking and ditched my pain meds and muscle relaxers for 2 1.75 liters of vodka that I downed in about 5 days. I was in a lot of pain but being drunk before getting hit, my adrenaline wasnt that high and I felt nearly calm. I stood back up and was like, \"Im fine\" although I felt it the next two weeks. (Also my drunkeness had nothing to do with the car hitting me. I was standing somewhere a car shouldnt have even been. She was distracted) but it helped me immensely and im not a fan of opiates or any other drugs but alcohol. No negative effects from that ammount of liquor that I could feel. I still go to work and do what I need to do. I dont spend my last dollars on liquor. I pay my bills. Functioning alcoholic all the way. A lot of people have no idea I even drink as much as I do. I guess I just want to know if anyone has been in this position. I know Im not going to quit unless I want to. And I dont. I weigh the positives over the negatives and I feel like it helps me more than harms, despite what it does to my body in the long run. I know im young and have a chance to turn it around, but at this point im happy with alcohol. I guess I just want input. I know its not healthy to drink as much as I do.",

            "selftext": "My younger brother is hopefully graduating high school next week and starting college in the fall. My family has been concerned about his drinking habit and are afraid it could grow out of control once he\u2019s in a college atmosphere.\n\nFor some background info, he\u2019s been exposed to alcohol since he was 14, had to have his stomach pumped due to a BAC of over .30 at 16, and had a similar situation where he was suffering signs of alcohol poisoning earlier this year but stayed home under my parents care(they\u2019ve admitted since then that he should\u2019ve been taken to the hospital). I\u2019m not sure whether to label him as an alcoholic since it doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s drinking every day of the week, but he has trouble limiting his drinking once he starts.   During blackouts he\u2019s kicked in a window, wiped out on a skateboard leaving a nasty scar on his nose, and God knows what else since he tries not to divulge this stuff to the family.\n\nSince he\u2019s the typical angsty teen that hates talking to his family, I think an intervention might be ineffective and too serious for his case. Regardless, next week will be the only time that both of my parents and myself will be together before he starts college, so we want to have some sort of talk to help him. We have no clue how to structure this or what to say, so I\u2019d appreciate any advice on what to do. I\u2019m really scared that he\u2019s going to get himself killed if he doesn\u2019t learn moderation or to just stop drinking entirely.",

Today I went to see my doctor to discuss detoxing and getting liver function tests done etc. My doc gave me urbanol (a benzodiazepine) to help me come off alcohol but I just got back home feeling really depressed and empty so I had one more drink to take the edge off as I felt like the urbanol wasn't really helping. My question is will I be okay mixing the two substances because I'm scared to sleep now. I feel relaxed enough after the drink but I just think the withdrawals are a bit overwhelming.

Once a week I like to get together with my best friends to play video games/watch movies, etc - just have fun together. \n\nIt usually lasts about 5-6 hours and in that timespan I will have 5 drinks (whiskey). Since I want to be honest, we don't measure the pours, so I bet it's closer to 7-8 typical 1.5 oz amounts. \n\nThe next day I don't feel horrible ( I can work fine ) but obviously I don't feel as well as the mornings when I don't drink prior. I really don't mind it though, because the memories with my best buds are so much fun :)\n\nI suppose my question is more of a technical one - is this frequency of drinking (once a week) harmful to my body long term? (Liver, stomach, etc etc)\n\nI just want to be pro-active, as I've seen how alcohol can negatively impact people's lives. \n\nThanks for reading!",

I\u2019m going to Mexico City this summer, and am wondering if anyone has any advice about traveling there as an ex drinker. I am sad that I won\u2019t be able to try the tequila in the land that it is from but i have enough painful memories associated with my behavior under its influence to say not.  I\u2019m more worried about coming off as disrespectful for refusing a drink or being unable to culturally participate in some of the norms associated with alcohol. Also really wish I could try the indigenous drink of pulque but alas that is the burden to bear of the alcoholic!",

The last 5 years my drinking has increased a lot. I drink alone, go to bars alone. I am spending money I can't afford to spend especially since I just quit my job. Because I'm single I frequent strip bars and prostitutes for company. I have had 2 x DUI's in last 3 years. \n\nMy main causes have been the way I look. From say 16 to say early 30's I have suffered from bad acne. This had slowly eaten away any self confidence I've had. I seem to have outgrown it now but it has fucked me mentally.\n\nThen low and behold I started going bald in my late twenties. To me that's a double whammy. \n\nFamily, friends (don't have many) say get over yourself. But I don't think they understand the turmoil I'm in.\n\nIt sounds simple stop drinking and you will come right mentally. For me I have tried it doesn't work. I rely on booze to calm and relax me at night. Suicide has been on my agenda for a long time but I couldn't put my family thru that so I just fantasize about it.\n\nMaybe I should be doing a 30 day treatment program. Problem is they are expensive I'd have to sell everything I own.\n\nThanks for reading my rant.\n\nI wish you all well.",

I feel like I can't write well if I don't have a few drinks in me, and the demand has gotten worse and worse in the last year. \n\nI drink a box of wine every day or two, or a fifth of whiskey a night, depending. I don't feel like I can perform, creatively, if I don't have some drinks in me. It's not every night, but it's more often than naught. I'm tired of feeling like shit, being bloated, being hungover, but I don't think I can keep doing it without alcohol. I don't know how to handle it except to keep drinking to fuel the writing.    \nif I quit drinking I don't think I can keep writing. I've tried a few times and I'm just shit without the booze. With the drink I write well and I get great reviews. What do I do? I feel like if I want to keep producing I need to kill myself with liquor, and if I quit I'll be a boring sober piece of shit that can't write. I don't know what to do.",

            "selftext": "I posted this in r/AlAnon just a minute ago, but I'm desperate for any advice on what to do.\n\ntl;dr close friend/roommate is a recovering alcoholic, who's parent's know of her drinking problem, but I don't think they know the extent. She had been sober for 5 months then went on a 12+ hour bender last night. She lied and gaslighted me all night to hide the fact she's blackout drunk. I've been on the blunt receiving end of her drinking and I'm beyond done being the only one to deal with it. Do I let her parent's know that she's back to drinking again?\n\nMy roommate (I'll call her Kate), is a really close friend of mine and is an alcoholic struggling to recover. We've lived together for 2 years now, been friends for 3, and both of us know of her alcoholism and struggles she has with drinking. Our relationship has been strained because of her drinking and she's tried numerous times to get sober. Every few months now, Kate goes on a bender for 10-12 hours then wakes up, cries, and makes so many promises about how she will get better. The past 2 years, I have dealt with this 15-20 times to the point where I am done being the only one who knows the whole truth and dealing with it. I've tried to be understanding and compassionate and to be the one who kept her on the straight and narrow path. I took on her issues and struggles as if they were my own (BIGGEST mistake). I've been the one to make solutions to the problems, only to get shit on by her later when she's blackout drunk. It's taken a toll on my well-being and I can't sit back and let her continue to avoid facing her issues.\n\nShe had been sober for 5 months now and last night she went on a non-stop 12+ hour bender. She lied, gas-lighted, and manipulated me all night long to try and hide the fact she was blackout drunk. We had plans to clean the apartment after she worked (she's a bottle service girl) and suddenly she had to \"work\" a few more hours. Not long after I see videos of her at a totally different bar than the one she was \"working\" at, downing drinks straight from a bottle and taking shots. I'm past the point of being done with her that I've already made plans to move out in 3 weeks and no longer will be the one to pick her up when she falls. She's now going to have to be the one to face that there are consequences for her actions. She's made my life a living hell when she's blackout drunk and I'm past the point of being done. Now, I'm trying to figure out if I should let her parents know how bad her drinking has become again.\n\nHer parents know of her alcoholism and that she has a drinking problem for years now. Her dad is a recovered alcoholic who has remained sober for over 30 years now, so he knows more than anyone about addiction especially drinking. They have tried to help her remain sober, but nothing has worked. I know them quite well and they really like me since they know that I have only the best interest in helping her and every time I see them they tell me how nice of a person I am since no one else has ever been able to really help and handle Kate. I suspect her parents don't know the extent of her drinking and she tries to diminish it with them, while I've continuously been on the blunt receiving end of it. I want to text her mom (I have her number) to let her know that Kate is drinking again and it's the worst it has been in a year.\n\nSo, should I text a 29 year old woman's mom to let her know that she's back to drinking again? Is it a bad idea and I should just stay out of it?",

I don\u2019t drink at all during Monday to Friday but drink quite heavily on the weekends. I\u2019m writing this now because the effects of heavy drinking on weekends caused me to completely break down last night. For example if I would drink heavily on a Saturday (especially when I go to football matches I drink minimum 12 bottles of Budweiser and that\u2019s just before 3pm). By Tuesday at work I would be so down and utterly miserable. I work full time but don\u2019t make a huge amount and it just seems all my money gets wasted on alcohol. I\u2019m so fed up of feeling like this, but my main problem is I get lonely so I resort to going out with a mate or two and just getting completely drunk to ignore the problems I have temporarily. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m trying to get across here but I believe alcohol is making me absolutely miserable and I wanted to see if anybody has been in a similar position. Thanks",

I'm a few years out of college, and since moving to new york a couple years ago i've just found that i definitely am abusing alcohol. I drink probably five days of the week, usually amounts under three drinks but one or two days of the week i'll have more. A lot more. I'm finding that I don't like the decisions I make when I do drink. I don't typically black out but i get into a headspace where i'll abandon what is a healthy choice for me and do something self destructive. (hook up with people i don't want to, etc.) I woke up today with an absolutely awful hangover, i drank somewhere between ten and twelve drinks last night, and i'm worried. I go to therapy and my therapist is also a resource for me, but they've also said that I seem to abuse alcohol. I want to go a week without drinking, and was wondering if anyone has any advice on how to stick to it. I've tried before but haven't been able to. Thanks!",

If I mention anything he threatens with leaving and says very hurtful things (which have deeply affected my mental health). How can I find a way to just accept his drinking without saying anything? which seems like the only option for him to stay with me. \n\nI ask him to get professional help several times but he doesn't want to go.

            "selftext": "First and foremost I want to say I'm not a doctor, or professionally trained counsellor. This is only my personal account, experience and opinion struggling with a lifetime of alcoholism.   \n\n\nI am 46 and have been sober since Dec 1st 2017. Highly functional alcoholic right up until about 2008 and then it started catching up with me. That's when I entertained AA and started attending meetings thinking AA was the answer. The end result of that: A drawer full of 30 day chips, 2 medical detox's (7 and 10 days respectively) a costly treatment facility (12 step based) a life rebuilt and then pissed away yet again. Finally, another job loss, eviction and severe seizures that ended up with me delirious in the hospital.   \n\n\nA doctor matter of factly told me while reviewing my blood work: \"Well my friend, simply put....if you continue to drink you will die. Your liver is at the precipice. Make the choice\"  \n\n\nI made a call to two friends who were well aware of my alcoholism (had visited me in treatment) and was so lucky to have them take me into their home. I lived with them for a year and I found SMART recovery: a non 12 step program that is science based. I came to the realization that attending AA all of those years was a colossal waste of time. I am an atheist, I do not believe in God or subscribe in higher powers. I do not get spirituality and you know what? I have no desire to. Furthermore, to other atheists, there is nothing wrong with that. Nothing.  \n\n\nHere are some things I have learned over the years (in point form and in no particular order). Again, this is only from my experience, I'm not a doctor:\n\n\\- AA is not for everybody (especially if you're atheist like me). AA is a default and the microsoft of recovery programs. \"Ahhh you are an alcoholic....go to AA\".  Do the research, there are plenty of options. I finally chose SMART Recovery.\n\n\\- Just because you got sober doesn't mean it's all rainbows and unicorns. Once that \"pink cloud\" pops the real work begins (Captain Recovery to Captain Relapse). \n\n\\-  Being a dry drunk is a real thing. Hey, you're sober now, you don't need to repeat those same behaviours you had as a drunk. Learn to unlearn and modify. Once you understand that freedom, I guarantee you will smile. I have never felt such liberation - only someone in recovery will understand this euphoria. Don't ever let it go, know you can do anything you want now (except drink, sorry). \n\n\\- Triggers: If you want to hide away from the world and just go to meetings (AA or otherwise) because you're afraid you might use again, that's up to you. It's not really living is it? Get out there!! Slowly at first but get out there and experience the world sober. It's not as boring as you think without a mickey in your pocket.\n\n\\- Hold a mock funeral and grieve! You literally just lost the love of your life. You will grieve this loss and you will grieve hard and long (I still am). \n\n\\- Your addiction is not a disease. It's not.\n\n\\- Shame. Ahh shame. Nothing will open a bottle of liquor faster. Find a way to deal with it. You'll want prioritize this.\n\n\\- Enjoy the addict voice in your head..... forever. The addict is inside of you and will never go away until the day you die. It's doing push ups outside your door getting ready for you. It will take you back with open arms, without question..... which leads me to my next point. True that it's voice quiets in time but think of it as a radioactive isotope half life (it truly never dies).\n\n\\- There is no one road to recovery - don't let anyone ever tell you that. Make the choice to live, do the research and find your own path. Maybe it is AA or maybe dancing naked around a shrine of Hello Kitty (whatever keeps you sober).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally I want to say this: To all of the AA people that said to me that I can't do this without God/higher powers, without spirituality, without the 12 steps: Shame on you. All that did was add conflict. I can't imagine how many atheists/agnostics/freethinkers/non religious/non christians have walked through those doors and have walked right back out.  From my experience (and I've been to lots of meetings, in different cities) AA is very much a \"Jesus only\" club and if you're not with \"the program\" you can expect people telling you point blank you will fail (Enter the AA apologist here). You can do this without AA, but chance are you can't do it alone - find the program that works for you.\n\nA long chapter of my life is now closed and a new one is being written. I will remain vigilant of my addiction (not disease) and live the rest of my days as a sober man. Yeah, I'm only one drink from going back to where I was but I have a crisp clean twenty dollar bill that I would bet that I'll be sober tomorrow too. I just got tired of it, bored really. Bored of killing myself and living in insanity.",

            "selftext": "Hi all... so I just wanted to share some thoughts I have had on myself as I think I may be borderline dependent on alcohol.\n\nSo for a while now I have had a (relationship) with booze. I went though a trauma around 4 years ago and stated to binge drink stupid amounts of alcohol alone to help me feel better as I couldn\u2019t deal with my own feelings being sober.\n\nI started to drink eventually I would say 4 days out of the week? For a long time. and would always aim to get drunk as possible. I did slow down on the drinking but I always would find time to get pissed alone At least once a week.\n\nAnyway fast forward to today and I have dealt with the trauma I had, I had counselling, meds, support and all the good stuff and generally feel much better in myself.\n\nThe problem is though that now I have an awful impulse to still drink and I prefer to drink alone...\n\nThe longest I can last is around 2 weeks and that\u2019s only because I live with other people who would not approve of me drinking myself into a stupor alone whilst they watch tv..\n\nI have never really considered I have an alcohol \u201cproblem\u201d because I always blamed it on my trauma and saw it as justified but now the traumas delt with and I am still drinking alone o guess I\u2019m just trying to share n get some support as it\u2019s the first time I have actually started to wake up to my drinking.\n\nSorry if the post is a little wonky but I guess I would just like some feedback on what I should do. :/ \n\nTy, Jay",

Even with 90+ days sober while together I still had alcoholic behavioral tendencies which drove her into another mans arms. I\u2019m venting this for the alcoholic who may be suffering and may hear something to keep them on the straight and narrow. I heard an old timer once say that a bad behavior is like a flat tire. You won\u2019t get very far unless you\u2019re willing to change it. Or you just end up stuck in the middle of nowhere. This isn\u2019t my first time as a newcomer but I hope to make it my last.",

My dad didn't drink since he did not.\n\nHe continued to drink shortly after that. He took me out to a bar. It was about 1 pm, my first time drinking before 9 pm.

We use to spend every night together bbq'ing.  Have not had any arguments. No weird stuff.

The only time we hang out together is if there is a sport or UFC fight on, and we'll hang out at his place  or mine and have some drinks.  Aside from that, he will act that he is not drinking (but he did admit to me that he has been drinking every night by himself lately, and even though I live 2 minutes away he hasn't called me over)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat said..there are nights where he will be off for a few days, and he'll drink every night by himself, but if a sport comes on TV we'll hang out and I'll have drinks at his place, but he won't drink while I'm there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know....I know we both have a problem, but this is confusing.

            "selftext": "So, I'm in the UK.  Around 2 months ago I attempted suicide due to my alcoholism (among other factors).  I was referred to an organisation called 'Change, Grow, Live' (yes it sounds like a garden centre, except it's probably less helpful!).  As I was referred there I was discharged from psychiatric care. \n\nI attended on 23 April 2019.  I was granted an 'assessment' appointment on 3 May 2019.  I was told not to attend any groups/participatory activities pending a medical assessment.  On 14 May, I went to the office and complained I hadn't heard anything.  I also emailed the organisation's head office.  Nothing.\n\nI can't just 'stop drinking' because I am physically dependant and don't want a seizure.  I'm trying to cut down but the longer this goes on, the less I am motivated to do so and the last few days my alcohol consumption has been increasing again.  \n\nQuite honestly, this is a disgrace.  I am no longer working and don't have the funds for private treatment.  Even if I did, I have paid into the health service via NI for all of my adult life, why should I pay again for treatment?!\n\nI have never felt so isolated and unsupported.  I suppose one of my reasons for posting this is to let everyone know that if I don't make it, the fault is laid at the doors of Change Grow Live/ the NHS not having a receptive and active support for those who fall into alcohol abuse.",

            "selftext": "Apologies in advance for long post. \n\nSo my mother in law has had a drinking problem for a long time. It is one of those secrets that was never talked about. She was what I would call a high functioning alcoholic. \n\nIt\u2019s been getting a lot worse and my father in law came to my wife and I in a lot of distress last week. \n\nWe decided to stage a mini intervention with just the three of us and my mother in law. That was today. \n\nSo she immediately left after accusing us of ambushing her. Once she came back she threw me and my wife out. \n\nShe refused to talk to us and in the end my father in law left too. \n\nFather in law tried to discuss a few times over the rest of the day but didn\u2019t go well. In the end she drove (drunk) to a hotel for the night. \n\nThe drunk driving has never happened before as far as we know and is of great concern. We went and picked up the car from the hotel and she was very upset about that. She threatened to hire a car and go to a hotel out of town if we didn\u2019t return the car right away. We told her we would not bring it back and think it\u2019s best for everyone to take some time and connect in the morning. \n\nI have no idea what to do. She is a very stubborn and intelligent woman but the alcohol is making her irrational and combative. \n\nThis is probably not enough information but it\u2019s late and I\u2019m at my wits end. \n\nHope someone can help. \n\nThanks.",

I\u2019ve gotten random pains before, I figure they\u2019re usually related to the drinking and it just makes me slow down for a couple days. I woke up this morning to a pain just under my right ribs/in my back. It hurts to move and even lightly touch it and my self diagnosing makes me think it\u2019s a liver thing. I haven\u2019t had anything but water today (and tacos) but it hasn\u2019t improved. If it doesn\u2019t clear up by tomorrow, I should probably go see a doctor, just wondering if anyone else has had this pain before, seen a doctor about it or found a remedy for it. And yes, I have been reading all day about AA and it\u2019s made me consider getting help. I know that if I go see my doctor for this they will highly recommend it (they\u2019ve already suggested some sort of out patient treatment for drugs/alcohol before but I never followed through).",

            "selftext": "Sorry if this whole post is a big long mess, i've never really talked about this before.\n\nIm a 22 year old female and I've been drinking heavily for about 2 years. My boyfriend and I usually split a bottle of wine a night and have 2 shots of tequila. Ive found thats my limit to not be sick the next morning, but after the second shot i always think ill be fine with another. The only reason i don't take another is because my SO is there to stop me, but if he wasnt I would probably keep drinking til I passed out. We've been doing this for about a year, before we would take 4-6 shots of vodka a day and nearly every night i would pass out unconscious. I don't remember most nights and every day i feel sick, shaky, nauseous, stomach cramps, no appetite.\n\nI'm also worried that my drinking is negatively impacting my bf. He is incredibly supportive of me and has never been angry about my drinking that i know of, but he always drinks with me and I dont want him to form the dependency that i feel. I don't think if i was drinking he would be drinking either and he often says we should take a break but i can never do it.\n\nI just don't even know how to start recovering. If i just stop drinking will i feel withdrawal symptoms? Is it even safe for me? I am kind of interested in AA but i have an anxiety disorder and i usually have to take a shot before i go out. What can i do to motivate myself to want to quit if its already hurting my health and potentially my relationship? My bf has no idea what to do and i cant tell my parents because they'll probably lose their mind as both my siblings have addictions. I know the first step is admitting you have a problem so i guess im doing that right now, whats next?\n\nTL;DR im trying to start the recovery process and would appreciate some advice to keep me motivated to stop drinking",

My mum invited me for lunch a few minutes in the sessiin I had and I said yea, I'd come. But it was a big mistake. We got in a fight and from there the day became worse and worse. Next thing that happened was that I was thrown out of my second band and my replacement is the biggest dickhead ever. After that Most of the day was gone and everything was wasted. Started drinking, feel bad, depressed, angry at myself now. Tried contacting friends or motivating myself to go out by myself then. But no sucess in both.

I\u2019ve had several mishaps in the last year due to alcohol.... ....thinking back a couple of my relationships in the last 10 years were due to drinking. \n\nYesterday I was headed to the beach with some friends to ride bike( just cruising d beach on bicycles) and figured I\u2019d take a couple of shots before unloading the bike.. well apparently it must have been some big shots bc i got a little drunk, fell off d bike , fast forward to end of ride, I stayed and chilled on the beach, drank some more..... headed to car and took a nap , probably around 5-6 pm, woke up around 1 am ....\n\nThis morning I looked at the vodka bottle and it was literally EMPTY :-( . It\u2019s d small Absolute bottle.... due to the sleeping i stood up a date I had and this morning a female friend texts if I was still drunk, that I called her like 20 times... so embarrassed; falling off d bike while standing, breaking d date without notice, then d phone calls to my friend... thank god there was no drunk texting nor drunk driving. \n\nI had not bought a bottle in a couple if weeks, telling myself that would avoid the bInge drinking , and only drink when i go out... When I go out I never have a problem bc I limit myself to two drinks since I have to drive home.  So that tells me I\u2019m not an alcoholic since I don\u2019t crave it daily. \n\nLesson learned... hard lesson.   Maybe no one will read this but made me feel better. I just can\u2019t dial in the drinking volume when I\u2019m by myself.",

Pushed most of my friends away, and I feel that the few that still talk to me do so out of pity. In my descent into drunken madness, I also made several depressing/aggressive/snarky comments online. Basically I have ruined my reputation, and people in my circle think I'm either a lunatic or an asshole (or some combo of both).   \n\n\nI'm almost 2 months sober and though I appreciate the clarity I have now,  I am also starting to feel the unnerving regret that I should have felt long ago. I am remembering how badly I have treated people in the past. I hate how despicable I was and **truly feel like a piece of garbage**. I feel that no amount of \"sorry\" or charity will change what people think of me. And honestly, I think I deserve it. But I just want to have peace of mind. How have other people in here dealt with this type of regret?",

I felt like I was forcing tears, in order to not to seem insensitive or uncaring, even though this person means the world to me. \n\n I was already an alcoholic for maybe around June 2017, I just turned 21 in April. I\u2019ve been drinking whiskey almost every day since sometime in 2017. \n\nI cry when I get drunk enough and it\u2019s always about her. I cry at night whenever I\u2019m drinking. I cry about her during the day too, whenever I\u2019m drunk.\n\nI can\u2019t say how it is when I\u2019m 100% sober because I haven\u2019t been sober in months. But when I am sober (mostly during the day) I\u2019m okay. I think about her, tears come to my eyes, but I don\u2019t have a full blown crying fit over her. I might shed tears, you might hear a few sniffs and puffs. Unless I\u2019m day drinking \n\nOtherwise, if I think about her enough, tears start coming, I\u2019m bawling my eyes out, I try to keep quiet. \n\nWhy do I feel as if I grieve more when I\u2019m drunk? Is this okay? Does this make me a bad person? Does this mean I don\u2019t truly care about her when I\u2019m sober? Why can\u2019t I feel pain when I\u2019m sober?",

I figured I\u2019d be able to drown the problems, but I only reminded myself of how addicting the temporary fix that is alcohol was for me. Since that recent night, I\u2019ve been tempted to drink to get rid of even the most minor problems.\n\nIt\u2019s been nearly a week and I\u2019m proud of myself for staying away from drinking aside from that one night. I guess the issue is that there\u2019s slight temptations and consideration in my mind to drink again, and I have a constant fear or caving in.

After a couple hours she gets upset and rants and I listen then tell her she needs to go to bed, she has work early in the morning. Her friend calls, she seems fine, I go to sleep because she's in a better mood. I wake up to her calling my name. Shes crying about how she cant go to work. We fight about how I should get her out of her responsibility. She hits me. I hit myself. In hitting myself, she tries to stop me, she gets hurt. I dont know how to defuse situations like this.

Don\u2019t have to worry about hiding my breath around other people, or having to make an excuse as to why I can\u2019t drive. But otherwise, mentally, I\u2019m the same. I\u2019m just in a lull all day. At least when I drank I enjoyed my time for those few hours I\u2019d indulge, even if I felt like shit the other 20 hours of the day. \n\n\nPeople who are sober, how did stopping affect your mental health?",

            "selftext": "First things first: I'm new to reddit and english is not my first language, so I apologize for grammar mistakes and/or posting this on a wrong subreddit.\n\nMy father has been having a drinking problem since I was born (almost 18 years) or maybe even longer, everytime he drinks, he gets aggressive and is searching for a fight with everyone. Relatives don't invite our parents most of the time because of this. My father has been also hanging out with \"friends\" who all have a criminal record on their shoulders and they always drink, smoke cigarettes and even smoke weed (which is not legal in Germany). My mother had a similar experience with friends like this and knows how it will go in the future. Especially because all of his friends lost their families and friends to their alcoholism.\n\nMy moms health is at risk too, she has been born with epilepsy which means that she will get seizures when she is under much stress. In the 17 years I have been on this earth my mom had only two seizures, one when we (my sister and I) were really young and one just a few months ago. Everyone who saw a seizure knows how terrifying it is and to imagine seeing their own mother having one and not having the knowledge on how to deal with that is even more horrible. My mom told us that, the reason was not because of all the work she was doing at home, but because our father told her, while being drunk, that he will not hesitate to leave her when she doesn't start to get 'sane' (I still have no idea what it means) and that his problems are all her fault. \n\nOur father damaged things while being drunk (doors, relationships, partys etc.) and you really have no idea what could happen next. My mom is afraid that his friends will introduce him to stronger drugs and that even more money will be spent on alcohol and cigarettes. Our father hasn't hit anyone of us (yet) but it could happen anytime and when he would dare to hit anyone, we would immediately move to our grandparents (my mother's parents), so said our mom.\n\nShe is afraid of our safety and doesn't know what to do. We all know that the problem is the alcohol, because he is very well behaved when he is sober. She doesn't want to talk to her parents about it, because she doesn't want to bother them with something like that (she even had problems telling us about our fathers weed consum) and a divorce is out of question. A therapy and anonymous alcoholics would have a language problem because our father can barely speak german (a few sentences maybe, but talking to him requires our mom for the translation) and he knows nothing about the english language. He can speak russian though, but I doubt that there are therapist for russians only in Germany.\n\nThe 'just wait and pray' tactic didn't work in the last 17 years and our mom tried some bs with 'inner purification', spoiler; it doesn't work either. Our father doesn't understand the situation and thinks we are overreacting, he doesn't see anything wrong with his friends, even though one of them hitted an old woman with his car, and he thinks that the insults won't be a big deal because he 'didn't meant it'.\n\nWe are afraid that another one of his insults will cause another seizure and god knows if my sister and I are in the house to help her.\n\nI just need some advice and I'm grateful for anything you guys come up with. We just don't know what to do.",

But not because I chose to or thought about it, I would just wake up and not drink or have an urge to drink for a month or six months or etc. Some mornings I'll wake up and walk to the liquor store, buy literally any kind of alcohol come home drink all of it, take a nap, wake up and then start my day in ernest. I can be in the mood for a single shot or a six pack of beer or a bottle of wine, or liquor, have it and then not touch it again. I've woken up still drunk a few times, but I've never had a hangover. I drink alone and quickly 99% of the time.  \n\n\nNone of my drinking habits or if it is alcoholism, makes sense to me. Does my drinking behaviour make sense to anyone else?",

He is a nice guy but he's also into violent interests. I don't know if it's me or him but we seem to not being able to communicate at times. He does like to shorten down when speaking or texting and he isn't really clear at times, maybe because he is tired, maybe because how he is raised, maybe because of me? I notice when something is off by how what and how he write, but I still seem to lack the knowledge of what is happening or what to do in some of our communication. Would someone really be that careful around someone with Autism, what can I do to support him? He was raised by teachers and I was raised by artists, so there is that and I don't know if that makes sense other then us being different. Am I with Autism just complicating things by my lack of social skills, or is it my partner's alcoholism even though he is sober and has been for a month now? Is an alcoholic like Dr.Jekyll and Mr.Hyde or does he have Narc or Bipolarity? Maybe he is just normal and i'm the problem?",

            "selftext": "So I haven\u2019t talked to my dad in weeks after seeing him at my cousins get together because he totally embarrassed me the way he looked and was acting due to his alcoholism. I called him that night of the party told him what I thought of how he was acting and he just Acted like he was drinking again \ud83d\ude44 and said I don\u2019t wanna hear the stupid stuff so he then hung up on me and that was it would never answer me again that night so I stopped trying to call him anymore. It\u2019s hard because he lives alone and I\u2019m his only child and so I always call him a few times a day to check up on him and just be nice. But I can\u2019t keep trying anymore if it\u2019s getting nowhere and he just denies he has a problem every time I bring it up and then I\u2019ll just get hung up on again! So I stopped calling him and he hasn\u2019t called me since either.\n\nSince the party when my aunt and cousins last seen him 1/2 of my aunts and his only siblings said he really looked horrible and not his usual self. So she said she would call me in a few days and see what was up and get some scoop on what\u2019s going on with him. And I told her everything about how he drinks a lot more constantly and he\u2019s now retired and I think that\u2019s making it worse. And that he might have a secret undiagnosed medical problem that he doesn\u2019t want to get checked (I think he has a problem where his throat needs stretched because it\u2019s not wide enough and food sometimes gets caught when he eats) and maybe he\u2019s drinking because of that or the drinking is causing it idk. So my aunt said she would secretly go over to his house and talk to him see what\u2019s going on discreetly and it seemed like the other day she did that he did have more motivation to go out and do things like he has new putting off getting his hair cut for about a month overdue and he finally went and did that. So I don\u2019t know if her going over there kinda pushed him or what but it seems like from what I can tell he\u2019s doing more than just sitting at home but I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s lessened his drinking yet but maybe he just finally forced himself to do better physically because of how he looked at the party and he was maybe embarrassed and finally realized it Idk? Do you think he could be progressing even if he doesn\u2019t drink any less?",

I have made a conscious decision that I am going to control myself and watch for triggers that have got me in trouble before.  I only had a few beers and did not partake when the rest of the group was having shots.  From this night I can say that I did not engage past friendly conversation from women that were hitting on me, I walked away from a guy in the bar that was being extremely aggressive with me, and I talked a friend out of taking home a women who was also drunk but had a boy friend, convincing both of them that what they are about to do is not worth it.

She is moving and her husband has a chronic illness so she won\u2019t be able to visit, which is really scary. Also, I\u2019m scared because my parents are awful and abusive.

I get anxiety when I don\u2019t have the option. I have two semesters of college left. My dad especially suffered the same. I only drink at night though. He used to drink at work at home always. I am worried I may be slipping too. I\u2019m running low on money and alcohol. I am what you may call a \u201cfunctioning alcoholic\u201d. I am able to wait until I know I won\u2019t have to drive. But as soon as I know I hit the bottle. I can sometimes control it.  I wonder if it\u2019s obvious or if people just don\u2019t notice. I drink 1-2 mixed rinks a night or 3-4 wine glasses/beers. I am basically forced to not drink at this point as of money. I am lucky I have what I have, I am happy I have what I do. But I still feel Ike I need to drink to fall asleep. I just needed to vent I guess. I may have an issues but I\u2019m not sure. Does anyone else understand where I\u2019m coming from? I just feel so lost.",

And also he acknowledges that he spends over 15000 a year when he talks about it. I am looking for some advice on how to help my dad and his condition and where I can go to find some support",

When bringing up her needing help, her response was that she basically doesn\u2019t give a shit but I also think her pride (some narcissism here) plays into that response. \n\nThank you for any help or suggestions or advising in what to do or not do.

            "selftext": "for starters I am not asking for medical advice per say, just opinions based off of experiences. before anyone says \"speak to a doctor\"... I have tried. my old psychiatrist was about to begin prescribing naltrexone for me but my insurance changed and I can no longer see him. I have called every psych practice in my area and the first appointment availability there is in mid June. I called my local urgent care to see if they could prescribe things to help cease drinking and they cannot. Ideally I would like to avoid the ER if I can to be honest and in patient rehab is not an option as I have two children.\n\nI am 27 a years old, female, 170 lbs and I drink anywhere from 4 to 20 bud lights a night depending on the night and circumstances. normally I don't day drink but sometimes I do. Usually I will go to bed around 8 or 9pm with my last drink being somewhere around that area and I won't start getting anxious to drink until the next evening when I'd begin drinking anyway. I don't get shaky.. just a lot of anxiety and diminished will power. I began daily drinking when my ex died two years ago as a means to cope and fall asleep. prior to that I drank but it wasn't an everyday thing even though I will admit, I did have a love affair with alcohol to a certain degree. In the last two years I was sober for 9 months while pregnant, relapsed after having my son and became sober again a month later for about 5 months. \n\nagain I am not asking for media advice but if anyone could just help me feel better about qutting.. I am seriously so scared of having a seizure even though I'm not drinking a handle a day... what I do drink on the scale is considered heavy for my gender. I understand people being cautious over seizures and DTs but honestly how prevelant are those things really? I'm just looking for advice, direction and encouragement. anything helps..",

This resulted with, of course, me embarrassing myself in front of my friends. I said and did some things I am not proud of. I decided to stay sober for a while, at least untill I get my s*** together.\nThis of course wasn't the first time, and I am afraid it won't be the last time...\n\nHave you ever embarrassed yourself? \nHow did you deal with the embarrassment?\nWhat was your next step in dealing with alcohol?\nDid you talk to a therapist?\n\nThank you for answering in advance.",

            "selftext": "Hello fine people of r/alcoholism. I am entering my fourth day of no drinking after close to 10 years of extremely heavy daily drinking (about a fifth a day). I recently had a medical scare that opened my eyes on some changes I need to make in my life, first and foremost starting with cutting out alcohol. The scare I had has been enough for me to lose my desire to drink at all, which is something I don\u2019t think I could\u2019ve ever done. I hate that that is what it took, but it is and I\u2019m grateful enough that I caught my medical issue when I did. So craving alcohol isn\u2019t a problem at this point and outside of some anxiety, I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve experienced any withdrawal symptoms. It seems like the main issue I have is what to do with my time. My normal day used to end by drinking until I passed out once nighttime hit. But now that I have cut out the alcohol, it\u2019s a very weird feeling because everything I used to do in the late evenings was tied to alcohol. Watching sports, playing video games, even just watching my favorite TV shows all seems tied to alcohol. Not that I don\u2019t enjoy those things still but it\u2019s just a weird feeling doing it without the booze. I\u2019ve tried going to bed early, but all my life (even before alcohol) I\u2019ve always been a person who doesn\u2019t sleep much. Does anyone have any tips or advice on how to deal with something like this? Thank you if you took the time to read and good luck to all of you in your fight. \n\nTL;DR: Just quit a habit of heavy daily drinking, no clue how to spend my time in the evenings",

            "selftext": "I just wanted to share what has happened to me this week. The back story is, like most of us on here I guess, I have a history of alcohol misuse. From 18ish onwards alcohol has blighted my life. Somehow I've managed to get a university degree and a teaching career (in which my performance has been suboptimal to say the least). I've swung wildly between being a fitness fanatic (still drinking on \"treat days\" (every day lol)) and a 260lb slob. I've read all of the books - Allen Carr's led to my record 6 month sobriety. So, this Sunday as I sat in my bed downing wine and stuffing the empties in innocuous places to out smart my worried daughter (so pathetic), I blacked out not really bothered if I woke up or not. I'm 44 years old and could see no end to the misery and, to add insult to injury, have been off work with depression for the last 2 months. \nI woke up Monday morning saying \"never again\" as per usual. However this time something just clicked. Since Monday morning I've had zero, and I mean zero, desire to drink. I cant imagine ever drinking again. I'm really not being glib here; something has changed. Really changed. Has anyone else experienced this. I feel free at last!",

It has progressed to me justifying two four packs of strong (8.5%+) every other day. The days I don't drink are recovery days. Just enough rest in between work shifts to be \"ok\" enough to drink again. I need help. I have a three year old and a husband. My husband knows I have a drinking problem but he doesn't know how bad it really  is. I'm really good at hiding it. I think? My father had an addiction and killed himself over it. My mother is still struggling with her addiction. She has six children and we are all struggling with addictions. I have a great job and just got a promotion. My addiction is enough of a problem for me that I've been considering some kind of rehabilitation program. But I don't want to lose my job.  I really need some advice. This is my first post so I'm not sure how this works. I really don't know what to do.  I'm scared. More than wanting to be a better person, I want to be a better mother to my boy. I don't know what to do.",

I\u2019m having dinner with my ex next week because I\u2019m on vacation in his city, and apparently last time I saw him... something... upsetting happened? Enough that he was extremely concerned about me. \n\nBut I have absolutely no idea what it was because I don\u2019t even remember that night, I don\u2019t remember that month and barely remember that year. I did not even realize I saw him in the past few years until someone informed me.\n\nI also had a friend tell me about the time I got naked at a party, found a package of butter, and proceeded to get covered in butter which was apparently overwhelming for some of the guests. I have *no recollection of this*.\n\nI hear people describing what the gifts of sobriety are to them. For me one of them is a sense of feeling in charge of my own narrative again.",

There is nothing harder in this world than putting the bottle down. I was in the Army for 11 years, even tried the deputy sheriff life for about 6 months. I have multiple DUIS. I'm awaiting Veterans Treatment Court in 2 weeks. As long as I can complete that, I can hopefully start over. I've been trying to hide my drinking from everyone in my family. There are times where I'd honestly prefer to not be alive. My wife keeps finding my cans and bottles, only to be left with constant broken promises of \" it's the last time I swear. \" She tells me that I'm making a choice by buying and drinking it every time. She's probably right, I don't know. I wish it wasn't a \"choice\". I'd love to stop making that \"choice\".  Believe me, I'd love to stop making that choice. My life has been a living hell thanks to alcohol. The moments when I can not drink alcohol for maybe a week at a time, life is great, it couldn't be better. My constant relapses are a living hell. I'm VA disability connected for multiple things, to include PTSD. I'm sick and tired of letting everyone down, I hate who I am because of it, and I wish it was easy to stop making that \"choice\".",

We started by going over the group rules, then we did an exercise where we introduced ourselves to the person next to us, told them about our drinking and what we wanted to achieve. I had a nice chat with a nice man.\n\nThen came check in where we introduced ourselves to the group, told them about how much we were drinking and what we wanted to achieve, as well as handing in our drink diaries for the week. Several people were in tears over their progress (or what they saw as a lack of it). One of the facilitators pointed out that drinking more than you wanted to isn't a failure, it just means you set yourself the wrong goal.\n\nNext the group facilitators talked to us about detox, what it is, what happens and the process of referral. I'm hoping to go to detox so this was particularly interesting. A couple of people attending the group had been before and told us about their experiences, and they were overwhelmingly positive.\n\nThe facilitators made it clear to us that detox is not the end of the process, just part of it, and you need a plan for how you're going to manage once you come out of it. They made it clear that the days after detox can be dangerous because it's easy to slip into bad habits, and since you no longer have the same tolerance you can end up with alcohol poisoning etc. They also made clear that it's very stressful on the body even though they give you medication to make it seem like it's not, so they try to avoid repeated referrals.\n\nAfter a break we did a group exercise where we discussed support networks, and how those support networks can help us with recovery. We discussed a fictional person and the people in their life, such as girlfriend, parents, doctor, support worker, could help them with their recovery.\n\nNext a guest speaker from a local recovery facility came to speak about the services they offer and how they can help. They do things such as arts and crafts sessions, mental health support and music.\n\nThe guest speaker also talked about other local recovery services such as AA. Several people pointed out they had been to AA but didn't like it, so our guest pointed out that there are other services such as cocaine anonymous (which he described as \"quite lively\" which everyone found funny) and narcotics anonymous which also welcome people with alcohol issues.\n\nOverall this was the best week yet, and while it past weeks I've wanted to go straight for a drink I didn't feel like that anywhere near as much. I guess the message is like with any difficult process the most difficult step is the first step.",

            "selftext": "For sometime I was jokingly calling myself an alcoholic, as I knew I drank  far too often. At first it was just on the weekend with friends, then a couple years ago my mother had some health issues and after some time I realized I was up to drinking 6 nights a week at times, maybe  more. Not a lot always, but it started to be uncommon for me to not at least have a few beers a night, and on the week ends I would always get tuned up. It didn't seem like a big deal, as I am a pretty happy drunk, and I can hold my liquor far better then almost anyone I know (the men  in my family are well known for our genetic disposition for a very high  alcohol tolerance). A little over two weeks ago I cleaned out my  childhood home to prepare it for sale and buried my mother and found myself in a bender for most of the week.\n\nI am going on 2 weeks sober now, haven't had but 1 beer since the night of the funeral. Most of the first week I was very lethargic, and in a terrible mood, even my co-workers were like \"Whoa, calm down man...\". My motivation to do things around the house, and for overall self-improvement has come back. I am down at least 5 lbs already, likely closer to 10 now. I truthfully don't remember the last time I felt so  good and not had a drink in me.\n\nI don't plan on quitting drinking completely, as I still plan to do it socially with friends and family from time to time, but it definitely can take over and change your life without you even noticing if you let  it, but I probably don't have to tell most of the people here that.",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone. I\u2019m having a problem that I hope you all can help me find a way to deal with. \n\nI\u2019ve been with my husband for 15 years, and things have been great with the exception of one thing: his drinking.\n\nI think I\u2019d say he is alcohol dependent? Please correct me if this terminology is wrong. He binge drinks on average twice a week. Lately it has been about 8-10 beers ( heavier craft type beers) over an afternoon or evening. Once he starts, even if he has intentions of only having a few, he is unable to stop until he\u2019s drunk. He will buy a six pack with the intention of stopping there but almost always goes out for more once those are gone. I\u2019m not a big drinker but it has ruined it for me. Going out is only fun for the first couple drinks because I know what it turns into. I drink 1 beer, maybe 2, probably one to two times a month.\n\nLike a lot of people he changes once he\u2019s 4 ish in. He becomes more opinionated, argumentative, and just different. It\u2019s not like we argue about real things, he\u2019ll just bring up a topic from the current news cycle for example and get real amped up. Rarely is it an argument between us, mostly because I know it\u2019s just drunk him talking and I\u2019m just trying to get to bedtime.\n\nI love him more than anything on this earth, but I\u2019m seeing myself get more and more angry about this. What have I attempted up to this point? Well, I\u2019ve manipulated timing to ensure there\u2019s less time where he\u2019s just drinking (like going to dinner later and avoiding afternoon drinks), I\u2019ve brought it up and he knows it\u2019s an issue, but assures that he can stop. To be fair there have been a few stretches of time (not that many though) where he has cut it out completely.  And to be honest those times make me so happy.  If I\u2019ve ever brought it up while drinking, he says he works hard and isn\u2019t a bad person, as if my questioning the behavior means I think he is bad. He\u2019s not, it\u2019s just a detrimental behavior.\n \nThere are fun things that have happened that the memory of his drunkenness overrides the niceness of the memory. I\u2019ll look back at a photo and remember how he drank that night, etc.\n\nAnd, when he\u2019s up drinking I have trouble sleeping which really impacts me. Like last night I was unable to sleep until I knew he finished drinking and was eating dinner (which means he\u2019s going to bed). So I didn\u2019t get to sleep till after 12 and was up at 5 for work. Try as I might I can\u2019t just do what I need to do when it\u2019s going on. \n\nIf you\u2019ve gotten through my post, thank you and I appreciate you. This is the first time I have ever told anyone about this. I am just wearing thin on this and I feel done tip toeing around it. I wish he\u2019d either not drink at all or be capable of having a few and stopping. Any insight on a good first step forward would mean a lot to me.",

I'm day 4 off the booze, I was a daily drinker of around 10 pints/ day. I found drinking made me relaxed and care free. I work and have a good job, I have a partner who was was getting more and more distant and fed up with my lifestyle. \nI stopped after several medical issues and a stay in hospital of a week. Since stopping I have extreme anxiety and remorse. I feel down and guilty. I worry about everything from work to is my partner cheating. All in my mind but so hard and making me want to drink.\nWas I drinking to hide this or is this a result of drinking?",

I was very confused at the time by all his behaviour because he seemed quite lovely at times, but other times he\u2019d seem like he completely lacked empathy. I constantly asked him what\u2019s going on, but he wouldn\u2019t tell me anything, sometimes he\u2019d get angry at me for even asking. \n\nA few months ago, I discovered quite a few things he lied about and the borderline cheating I mentioned. I was considering leaving him because I didn\u2019t know whether I can trust him. A bit after that, he confessed to me that he had been secretly struggling with drinking for most of our relationship and it had gotten quite bad around the time the worst offences occurred. He said he believes the alcohol caused his bad behaviour and that\u2019s not who he really is. \n\nHe seems to have really changed, and even before I knew that he had quit drinking, he was being a lot better. It seems like it really was the drinking. He is being so lovely, never gets angry at me, hasn\u2019t been caught lying about anything, doesn\u2019t even check out other women. But how can someone change THAT much? A part of me feels like it\u2019s an act. \n\nIs it possible to change this much? Have you experienced something similar?",

I do my best to stay away from hard liquor so that it 'lasts' longer. If i finish a drink, and i usually drink pretty fast, i want another. My go to is usually wine or beer. \n\nMy SO often makes comments when he sees me drinking multiple drinks a night or night after night so i've learnt to hide it from him. I drink as a way to relax and to 'take the edge off' from the day but i am beginning to feel like this behavior might not be normal because of the frequency and shame behind it but im not sure where i stand yet in feeling that i need or want to cut back.\n\nMy drinking has not affected my work life. I'm currently 3/4 of a wine bottle + 2 beers in. I would like to know what the general population says about these habits and maybe if this is something i should speak to my doctor about.

Today he is very successful careerwise and generally healthy. I dont go out drinking with him much maybe once or twice a month. Thats all the drinking i do. During the last 12 months or so his behavior under the influence of alcohol has chanced in the following ways:\n\n- He drinks almost to the point of passing out. I have literally carried him a few times to the cab at night.\n- He sometimes gets very combative. Calls people at night to tell them \"his opinion\", sometimes he needs to deal with his drunken shit later.\n- He has accidentally fallen to the concrete twice.\n\nI know something is wrong here. Yet I have never said anything. Recently I have gotten the feeling im enabling this by going out with him and making sure he gets to the cab at least. I dont know what to expect if I confront him but I have a feeling its not going to be 2 adults discussing politely. At worst he might threaten with suicide, who knows. What the hell im supposed to do here? I cant figure out how to support him in a problem hes unlikely to admit",

            "selftext": "My 52 year old sister refuses to admit to anyone that she is an alcoholic. I am typing this as I sit in the hospital waiting for her to come back to her room . She is having a colonoscopy. She was brought in by her friend last Thurs because she was extremely dizzy. Her hemaglobin was 3.4. From what I've read, the normal level for a female is 12. She has internal bleeding but they can't figure out where it's coming from. They gave her five bags of blood to bring her hemaglobin up. It's still only around 8. She had an endoscopy, that didn't show any bleeding. While doing the endoscopy, the doctor discovered that she has Esophageal Varices. They did some repairs (?) on it but that isn't where the bleeding is coming from. Her stomach has been really distended for at least four years. *She continues to tell every doctor that she doesn't drink*. I think she has drank a lot less in the few months because she has been so sick. But heavy drinking definitely got her here. I also think she takes painkillers. She is a hoarder. She's had an eating disorder for most of her life. Her best friend told me that my sister could've had a liver transplant but she didn't want to stop drinking. If she leaves the hospital without addressing the issue, she will die. I don't know what to do. Her best friend knows a lot more than me and she has told me what's been going on. I'm scared for my sister and I'm at a loss at what I can do, if anything. Sorry if this is rambling. Thanks for reading this. Any advice would be appreciated.",

We obviously do more things together yet drinking is always involved. None of them struggle with Alcohol the way I do, keep in mind this is a group of 12 people who genuinely can enjoy the drinking culture of Wisconsin without over doing it. I on the other hand, can't have a single drink without losing all impulse control until I black out. This has severely impacted my relationships and mental health. I need advice, how does one stay sober in a group and area with such an emphasis on drinking? \n\nAny help is appreciated and welcome. \n\nThanks",

While my living parent and I processed in a pretty healthy fashion, she buried it. Since then, shes been diagnosed with PTSD, and has been on antidepressants and antianxiety meds ever since.\n\nMore backstory. My best friend is an alcoholic. I unknowingly watched the spiral. From only ever seeing her with a drink, to her teenage son telling me about her blackouts under the promise that I wont tell her, to her general behaviors about alcohol and 2 DUI's (one of which she lied about for over a year). Her son passed by his own choice, I've had to cut ties because she cant stay sober.\n\nSo now on to my sister. I've noticed more and more over the last few months that shes almost always got a drink in her hand. Every 4-5th time I talk to her, shes drunk. The last time I talked to her, she was out with her husband, and was drinking but told me not to tell our parent. That's when it hit me, and I started making connections between her and my friends behaviors.\n\nI called my parent and step-parent, because they spend some time together and we all have a really good relationship with each other. I asked them if they've noticed anything in regards to her drinking and they both said that they have talked to her and that shes pretty much blown them off. Now - although my sister and I love our parent and step parent, they have a tendency to come at conversations wrong. I've definitely blown them off on things they've tried to tell me, only to have it click later because their delivery was poor.\n\nI want to help her, shes super smart and has a lot to offer the world. But how do I go about that conversation without her putting her walls right up and not listening to me like my friend did?\n\nTldr: sister has been drinking often and to excess. Need to talk to her, how do I go about that without her shutting me out?",

            "selftext": "I've been in a relationship with my partner for almost 2yrs.\n\nEverything's great until I realized that he is an alcoholic. I am a social drinker, I know my limit and I drink responsibly.\n\nHe goes to the PUB nearly everyday (Mon-Sun) drinking until AM with his friends and gets home between 4m-6am drunk. He went out last night and just got home at 5pm today, he passed out @ sofa. \n\nHe often cancelled our plans or don't have interest to take us out (I have a young teenage daughter), do activities etc..he always comes up with excuses \"Tired after work, no money, no time\" yet he always have time to go to the PUB and get drunk (Especially after payday).\n\nHe became a complete different person whenever he's under influence, unpleasant. He accused me of infidelity, he accused me of being pregnant by someone else (we lost our baby last year and I never received any mental support from him, instead he made stupid comments about it), accused me of stealing his belongings (You kidding me right?) Calling me names and other things. It is hurtful and often I cried because of his behavior. Probably I cry nearly everyday because of this..because deep down inside I know that I don't deserve to be treated like this.\n\nHis excuse for drinking \"YOU WILL NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT I AM TRYING TO DO, I have problems, I am not perfect, this is how I deal with things.\" And I absolutely hate it whenever he say \"It is what it is\" - it is the most selfish and stupid thing to say. Nearly 2yrs later nothing's changed for the better.\n\nI love him so much, I tried to help him by slowly talking to him about how to get things better and how can I support him etc. But for him..in his world everything is normal and it's OK to drink foolishly. He thinks his behavior doesn't affecting anything in our relationship.\n\nI told him how I feel, I was brutally honest about everything but it seems he never takes me seriously. I feel like the only person that he cares is only himself. He knew how damaging it is..not only to himself but me and My Daughter. \n\nI'm hurting and tired coping with all of his nonsense, putting up with his cycle of alcohol and partying (He's nearly 40yo) He knew that and yet he's still doing it over and over again.\n\nI feel so alone and helpless. I am losing myself completely in this relationship and it is not right at all. He doesn't realize how huge the impact is to our relationship. I can't even having a proper communication, he always dissed me and calling me dramatic. I am mentally drained.\n\nDeep down inside I know he won't change, I don't have the power to help him if he doesn't have the willpower to help himself.\n\nHe's wonderful when he's sober but his drinking  and partying took the best in him. Sadly.\n\nFor those who had/ who are in a relationship with an alcoholic, please share your stories.\n\n\n\nThank you x",

            "selftext": "My ex was (is??)  a recovering alcoholic. I met him while he was new in his sobriety and he had about 7 months under his belt total. While we were together he told me a lot about sobriety and how he needed to stay sober or it would kill him and the last time he'd been drinking, he had liver failure. \n\nWe had a really, really good relationship together but ultimately what ended things was that he relapsed and I felt several things at once. That I wasn't ready to commit to him, that he wasn't right for me, and that I didn't want to get attached to someone who would be relapsing frequently. \n\nIn total we dated about 4 or 5 months and we did get very vulnerable with each other. I was the first and only girlfriend he'd had while completely sober and after awhile that scared me because I could see that he was tying his happiness to me.  I knew there were red flags when I went to break up with him the first time and he seemed extremely relieved that I hadn't, like it would have destroyed him if I had. That put me in a really weird position where I was terrified to rip the band-aid off because I wasn't sure how much it would hurt him. But after another month or so, I finally just explained everything to him -- that I felt we had big incompatibilities and was struggling with a fear of commitment. Within that week he quit his job and relapsed. That was back in February. He cleaned up again, we hadn't talked since until last week.\n\nWell Saturday he relapsed again after several months and I can't help but feel like I'm the reason. While he was drunk all day and night he kept rapidly switching between being angry at me, begging me to come over, telling me to stay home, telling me how much I'd hurt him and how he was never going to give up on me and basically that I'd really broken his heart. \n\nI tried to explain to him how none of this was good for me and I had to make the decision to preserve myself. I see a therapist now and he even agrees that my ex was very triggering for me. But my ex refused to understand and started begging me to be with him. At one point he said he wouldn't care if I was seeing other people because at least he'd have me and that he was falling very deeply for me. \n\nI feel so overwhelmed with all of this. He blew up my phone all night into this after noon with texts and calls, at one point said he hated me and I was a bitch and then a few minutes later said he just wanted to kiss me and hold me. \n\nI don't really know how to process this or what to do about it. I told his sister he relapsed again so at least he has someone to support him but he was really, really angry I did that too. I wound up blocking him on all social media and his phone number but then he started making more accounts and telling me I had to talk to him right now. \n\nFor now it seems he's stopped but I'm very afraid of what this might turn into. He turns into a completely different, violent person when he's drunk. But still I know he's just hurting so much he doesn't know what to do with it. I'm not sure if I should try to contact him again when he's sober or just leave it all alone and keep him blocked or give him a shot or what. I really don't know and I need some advice. I'm so stressed out with this whole situation because I really do love and care about him and I just want him to get better but I don't want to enable him. \n\nTL;DR: Alcoholic ex boyfriend relapsed and blew up on me from Saturday into this afternoon and now I'm not sure what to do.",

            "selftext": "So for about 3 months straight, I was drinking a half-liter of whiskey every single day, either maintaining a constant buzz or going out to the bar. At around the 2-month mark, I realized I had a major problem and resolved to quit, but my biggest trigger was a relationship that drove me into depression and frustration. Finally rid myself of him recently and gained a new friend who's been very motivating and supportive, so I'm doing pretty well at tapering off this past week or so. This is maybe my fourth attempt.\n\nHowever, my body's gone through some changes and I'm not sure how to deal with it. I'm down to maybe 5 or so shots per day, give or take. Usually I'm okay for quite a few hours during the day. But I only sleep maybe 3 or 4 hours, and when I wake up, I feel so fucked up and out of it. \n\nSome of my symptoms:\n\n* Feeling faint/tired/out of it almost all the time. Vitamin Water, orange juice, and a banana usually help me get regulated, but I still end up feeling a bit off.\n* A random panic attack maybe once a day, usually with very mild chest pains\n* Erratic heartbeat at times, or heart skips a beat when I'm sleeping, which makes me scared to sleep, though I don't experience this as much as I used to\n* Waking up with internal tremors (feels like I'm shaking, but on the inside of my body)\n\nAgain, I'm not even drinking that much, so I'm not sure why this stuff keeps happening to me, as I've tapered off slowly. When it does happen, I'll do a shot or so, but sometimes that doesn't even help. I've been to the ER three times in the last couple weeks for chest pain and faintness, but all they really tell me is to stay hydrated. Which helps, but I'm so tired of feeling out of it all the time. \n\nAnyone else deal with this while tapering off, or have any advice?",

However, I drink twice a week on average to the point where I'm at least 35% drunk (100% being my limit before I start getting sick/pass out or something like that). But, last saturday I went to a party and drank to the point where I lost all control of my actions and my sense of reason (on whats acceptable behaviour) and embarassed myself in front of people and did stuff I shouldn't have - fortunately, didn't offend or hurt anyone but it could've easily been the case. It wasn't the first time I got this drunk and did (seriously) regrettable stuff, but it also isn't something very frequent. However, I don't want this to happen again, as it really makes me feel like shit afterwards and could potentially hurt myself physically, socially and professionally, or, even worse, hurt someone else. \n\nQuitting drinking altogether is not an option as I really enjoy it and don't know if I could do it, but I need advice on how to keep the amount of alcohol I ingest \"responsible\". \n\nHas anyone been there?",

            "selftext": "My mom has had an unhealthy relationship with alcohol for nearly 20 years. When I was a kid, she would drink 2-3 beers every night. It got to the point that my dad threatened to leave, and they came to an agreement - she can only drink on weekends and vacations. She's maintained this for years (as far as we know, it wouldn't surprise me if she was sneaking some when she's home alone).\nMy dad and I have both tried to get her to stop. She's adamant that she's not an alcoholic. My dad just deals with it, and I honestly gave up trying after I moved out.\nNow, her drinking is causing a problem between her and my new husband. I grew up with her problems, so I can tolerate/ignore her. But it drives him insane. If we stop by at night on the weekends, she has troubling speaking.\nI just got back from a weekend vacation with my parents and a group of their friends (my husband didn't want to go, because he knew she would be drinking). We went out to eat every night, and usually hang out at a bar afterwards. Everyone else in the group would have 1 drink at dinner, 1-2 at the bar, and maybe 1 when we got back to the house we were renting. My mom would have 1 while she was getting ready to go out, 2 at dinner, 2-3 at the bar, and another 2-3 once we got back. Both nights, this ended  with her barely being able to walk or speak, and her puking.\nMy parents want to take my husband and I on a cruise for my upcoming graduation from grad school. My parents go on cruises frequently, and always get the unlimited drink package. I know from the stories I hear that she gets basically black-out drunk every night on these cruises. My husband doesn't want to go with them, and to be honest, I don't either. We've tried to respectfully tell my parents this, but they think it's because my husband just doesn't like them.\nI don't know what to do. My mom won't believe me when I say she has a problem. My dad and their friends just enable her. Obviously, I'll always put my husband first, but I don't want him to always have to avoid her.\n\nSo, two questions:\n\nDoes my mom's behavior sound like an alcoholic? She denies it because she only drinks in certain situations.\n\nAny advice on how to talk to her when she doesn't want to listen? I have a diagnosed anxiety disorder, which is making it even harder to have this conversation.\n\nThanks for any input!",

Is there an at home test strip thing that anyone knows about to prove it?  We looked into the breastmilk alcohol strips or the urine ones but I'm not sure if those work on colored drinks?  He mixes gatorade with his alcohol.  Thanks for your help and I hope it's okay to post this here.",

Ironic and unnerving, but I\u2019m glad to be addressing this. \n\nTo give a little history, I started binge drinking at 19. My father died about four months into it. I ended up with two DUIs by 21. To say that I am lucky to not have killed someone else or myself is an understatement. $30,000 later, relationships lost, and a permanent ban from Canada (cruel and unusual punishment, if you ask me), I still haven\u2019t been able to shake alcohol for good. I\u2019m 29 now and though I can go months without drinking or having a 1-2 drink \u201cchill\u201d night, I feel like at any moment this reckless beast is going to come breaking out at any moment. I feel I\u2019ve made a lot of progress, but how long is it going to take before I have a moment of weakness and make a horrible, drunken decision that I can never take back? \n\nWhich leads me to this question... what good has ever come out of alcohol? Drunken hookup?  One-night stand? Making \u201cfriends?\u201d Helping you \u201cforget?\u201d \nWhat bad has come out of it? \nFor me... depression, depression, DEPRESSION, apathy, memory loss, financial burdens, guilty conscience, criminal record, and the list goes on...\n\nSo why am I still drinking?! FUCK! \n\nI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m looking for out of this. Maybe I just need to get all my thoughts out there, but I\u2019m tired of turning back to alcohol and being stuck in this relentless cycle. \n\nThoughts anyone? Advice? Or just anyone that can relate?",

I\u2019ve been struggling with depression since I was 11. I\u2019ve had a lot of trauma in my childhood which proceeds to manifests in my relationships as well. Last night, I blacked out in front of friends and family at my graduation party. This has not been the first time this month that I\u2019ve blacked out in front of a lot of people. Last night was a wake up call, but I also don\u2019t know if I can make a smooth transition to quit drinking and go on anti-depressants without trying to overdose on the pills. \n\nI just want to hear if other people\u2019s experiences and how they\u2019ve gotten better. What made to decide to stop drinking, or any quotes/words of advice that enlightened you?",

She brags about being able to drink alot without getting tipsy. She cant go get her nails done without sneaking in a drink. Her \"bae\" just wants to drink and fool around with her. Im house sitting for her and can barely fit anything in the fridge because of all the alcohol. Now that summer's starting to come to Canada, its becoming more \"acceptable\" to drink and im worried shes just gonna spend all of her time getting smashed. I dont know how to bring it up with her, especially considering im pretty sure shes using it as a coping mechanism for the anxiety and depression she says she doesnt have. \n\nIm sorry, thwt was long and rambly, i just want some advice.

            "selftext": "I am 41 years old.  My 2 uncles, 2 cousins, grandfather.  All alcoholics.  I have just been through a horrible relationship with a suicidal woman with Borderline Personality Disorder.  I have always enjoyed drinks with friends.  I work in the entertainment industry.  After every show,  or opening night of our performances I have always had a lot of drinks with the cast and crew.  It\u2019s certainly an industry that revolves around alcohol, and occasional long nights of debauchery.  But I didn\u2019t do it every night.  And I could go for long periods of time when in work mode without a drink.  For certain periods during touring I went dry.  Mostly because I didn\u2019t want to spend half of my pay on booze.  I don\u2019t feel that I had that unhealthy a relationship with it that I ever let it affect my work.  But something changed after my gf\u2019s first suicide attempt, and several thereafter.  I remember sitting in my backyard crying into my drinks while she was in the psych ward.  And now, after four years of it.  And particularly after I finally had no choice but to end this relationship, which ended with her assaulting me, and a restraining order.  I can\u2019t get through the night without at least four drinks, often more.  I\u2019m writing this drunk right now.  I\u2019m waking up every morning feeling like garbage and I am so directionless now that she is gone. I think I need help, but I\u2019m afraid of AA.  I am an atheist. And I can\u2019t accept any christian related doctrine.  Maybe that\u2019s just an excuse.  But A member of the church molested my uncle and I know it is at least partially responsible for his alcoholism.  Along with several close friends in Indigenous residential schools.  I can\u2019t and won\u2019t accept the idea of a Christian god.  I need something else.  But maybe I have an inflated idea of how much of AA is fueled by this. I don\u2019t know.  My mother is also a paranoid schizophrenic.  It\u2019s been a long hard life.  I had my first therapy session with victims services and they were very supportive, But I mentioned the alcohol problem. And she said, one thing at a time.  But I think I may have understated the problem.  Anyway, I guess I just need support or advice. I think I need to get more help",

How do you control your drinking?\n\nBinge drinking 2-3 times a week; seems Like i just drink the vodka straight from the bottle throughout the evening or weekends vs just serving myself a glass, which I think would allow me to pace my drinking. \n\nI get stupid when I get drunk. My ex wife will text or call me the next day and ask me if I remember what I texted or told her the night beginning and Zi don\u2019t; like I blanked out. \n\nI think I\u2019ve done a stupid thing or two in 2-3 of my past relationships bc of not controlling my drinking. Yet, it\u2019s not like I get a panic attack nor anxiety if I don\u2019t drink. \n\nI want to be able to control the volume of drinking and that seems to b d problem. I don\u2019t realize how much I\u2019ve drank :(. \n\nI want to have a drink and sometimes it\u2019s fine, I have a drink and the bottle lasts all week. If I go out I don\u2019t get drunk. So it\u2019s confusing how I can control it under certain circumstances. \n\nJust needed to vent i guess. Not drinking now btw. \n\nIcing on the cake? Showed up drunk or buzzed at work a week ago. Can\u2019t remember what happened but it must have been embarrassing bc i asked a friend that works with me and he asked with a surprised look \u201cyou don\u2019t remember anything?\u201d  I left it there as I felt too embarrassed at that point. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I am a problem drinker or an alcoholic? Thoughts and why? After writing this, it sounds like an alcoholic:(. \n\nAnyone with similar drinking issues , where you don\u2019t crave the alcohol but if you drink it you over drink?\n\nThanks",

            "selftext": "On average I'd say that I'd drink around 14 to 18 beers in one night. Standard Friday and Saturday night for me is to go to the store at the beginning of the evening, get about 24 beers and sneak them into my room because I still live with my parents and don't want them to worry about me drinking so much. Throughout the workweek I pretty much drink every day too, and I feel kinda proud when I haven't drunk one day, but during workdays I usually just drink a couple, maybe 4, and when I do drink much I try to drink not more than 10 (i do this maybe max 1 workday). I can't go through a weekend without getting fucked up as possible on friday and saturday, and if I wouldn't drink I would feel like I missed out on something. I'm always hungover on sat and sunday, waking up at 4pm feeling like shit. I almost always wake up with blackouts, not remembering how I ended my night or not remembering encounters with my parents or someone else.\n\nIt also had an impact on my life. When I was 17 I was in the army and I made the most money I ever made in my life. Every weekend I'd buy 2/3 crates of beer (24 beers per crate) and pretty much wasted huge parts of my income on alcohol, to a point where I didn't have money to travel to my base and had to borrow cash. I was drunk every weekend, and did a lot of stupid shit which got me a criminal record and made me force to resign from the army because I'd be dishonorably discharged otherwise. So I lost my job, went back to school and got into some more trouble, couple of times in jail, huge fines, one DUI on a moped, basically just stupid pointless shit that I'd never do sober, so it's pretty safe to say that alcohol has ruined my career. I also believe I have somewhat anxiety and alcohol helps with that which is also a shitty combo to make a habit of. At school I'm sometimes hungover as shit, making me skip classes and even did an exam still drunk from the night before last week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlcohol hasn't really affected relationships with my family, but then again they know I drink a lot but not as much as I really do. I'm not sure what to think of all this, I'm convincing my self I'm not an alcoholic but at the same time I can argue that I can't even go a couple of days, or let's say one week without alcohol, and I convince my self that it's maybe just for a small period of my life, just being young, but then again I've been drinking a whole lot compared to my peers the last couple of years. I feel like my life will be 10 times more boring than it already is without alcohol, like a light in a dark tunnel after a workweek for example.",

Alcohol was my prison for 3 long years. I don\u2019t miss anything about who I was when I was drinking: constantly broke, sick, irritable and cruel. I don\u2019t miss the shaking, the bargaining with myself, the constant shame and humiliation, the lying and blaming and justifying. One of the hardest parts of recovery has been learning how to live with all this regret. That and my mother, who has already lost a son to drug abuse, are the main things that keep me going.\n\nI\u2019m wondering though if anyone else still feels like they\u2019re waiting to drink again. I remember my first few attempts at sobriety: \u201cI\u2019ve been so good this week, I can have a beer,\u201d and all the shitty addict logic you use when you\u2019re not ready to say goodbye to the poison. When I finally quit after my brother\u2019s death, I grieved for alcohol, and thought I had finally accepted that I couldn\u2019t control my addiction and drinking could not play any role in my life.\n\n479 days later, I still feel...dry.  I\u2019m always restless, always bored, always looking for the next thing to obsess over. I feel like I\u2019m always waiting for sobriety to really sink in and feel permanent. It\u2019s this constant sensation of waiting for some reward I can never have.\n\nI know drinking won\u2019t relieve this feeling, and I\u2019m barely tempted. Does this ever go away? Hobbies, music, weed, and friendships definitely make my life feel more full, but every night I\u2019m overwhelmed by what I can only describe as a thirst.

            "selftext": "I'm posting here for the first time, although I've wanted to for the past few months. I'm sorry if it's not the right subreddit, and I'm sorry for any mistakes, I'm from Poland. It's also pretty long.\n\nMy father is an alcoholic. I was too small to remember his worst times, but from family's stories I know he started drinking in his 20s, lost his job as a policeman because of it, trashed the car and nearly died. I only remember him sleeping drunk or my mom crying and not wanting to tell me why.\n\n At the beginning of 2000s he didn't drink as badly as before, to the point he'd pass out, but I remember my mom being really irritable when he would drink, and whenever I got angry at him for that she'd tell me that when I was small I told her not to yell at him bc he has a headache, and that hurt as hell too. He drank mostly on family parties, sometimes too much, but never too the point he'd pass out.\n\nA few years ago my mom was diagnosed with cancer, and bc my dad had to be available to go with her to various doctors and chemo, he was drinking even less. He also had a work related accident prior to mom's diagnose, that left his shoulders in a pretty bad state, and was on pension as he was going through rehabilitation. \n\nUnfortunately a year and a half ago mom died, right after her own mom. It left only us two at home, as my for older siblings arrested their own families. He didn't drink much after her death, what I was afraid of, until he went to sanatorium for a month, where he stayed at a hotel and had everyday treatments. As it was over half the country away from home, I can't be sure if he drank every day, I'm afraid he did, but usually to the point of being tipsy (I can recognize quite well how drunk he is by his voice, or I want to think so). \n\nBut since he came back, a year ago, I noticed he has been drinking nearly every day. When we go to my sister's house, usually to help her on her farm, or to repair, help paint the house, he and my neither in law would drink, at least one beer. I tell him he shouldn't, and he'd get offended, or say that I'm overreacting and it's just a one beer after a day of hard work. He always gets really defensive when me or my sister tell him he drinks too often, that we're concerned about his health, says he's not drinking that much. \n\nI try not to get angry, though it's hard, and I explain him over and over again that even he drinks I feel anxious, left alone, that I don't want to lose him, but he tells me not to get dramatic. \n\nI decided to post it all here today, after we were at a christening and we had a lift home. I was ready not to drink, drive home whenever I want to, but in the end I decided to drink as I haven't in a long time. My cousin was filling up the glasses in a record time, and even though I asked my dad before the party to be careful, he ignored me. When, after I don't know how many glasses of vodka and noticing my dad was pretty tipsy, I gently nudged him and let me tell you, that was a mistake. He immediately got defensive, said that he's an adult, that I'm not his mother, and he'll drink as much as he wants to. He also didn't want to go home when his father and step mother wanted to, so I got angry, called my brother and uncle to get us home, and left my father with the rest of the family as they said they'll get him home. \n\nAnd they did. He could barely walk, sat on the sofa and threw up on himself, and refused to get himself ready to sleep. I started to cry, because I felt so helpless, so overwhelmed, like I was left alone with overgrown toddler. In the end I called my brother again to help me, and he convinced dad to go to bed. \n\nRight now he's sleeping, and I'm afraid he'll choke in his sleep or sth, and I know he'll feel like shit tomorrow, drink a beer, ignore my concerns, say it was a one time thing (again), and then drink every day, at least a beer or a glass of whisky. \n\nI have no idea what to do. He says that as long as he's not laying in a ditch, it's not a problem, others say I'm overreacting, but I can't stand him after he drinks. It's there anything I can do to help? I know he has to help himself, has to want to change, but is there really nothing I can do?",

            "selftext": "Here's my random tip of the day, but firstly a bit of backstory. \n\nI haven't had a drink in what feels like a lifetime. In reality, it's been about 4 years, and in these 4 years, I've progressed by leaps and bounds. \n\nNow I need to add in one more thing. Some people really embrace their ex alcohol addiction and turn it into a badge they wear on their sleeve. My brother did this. He quit drinking and then his whole life became obsessed with it. He not only joined AA, but he also leads AA meetings, even at his house. I'm sure he helped many people on the way, and I'm sure he was also mostly also doing it to reinforce his own quit, but he also didn't care about any publicity he got. Hell, he was almost happy to be associated as an ex-alcoholic, and it became his identity. He is also larger than life type of character, and if this is you, then this advice does not apply. \n\nI'm coming from a different place. The day I realized I found the solution was the day I stopped thinking about alcohol. It simply stopped being a thing in my life and frankly I didn't want any association with it. I still don't. \n\nBut your past can at times even catch up with you. You know if you live in a small town but even if you don't. \n\nPeople LOVE to gossip, and word gets around. And someone who knows someone who knows someone will eventually know someone you work with, and then BOOM. If you work in any type of professional setting you'll know where I'm coming from. \n\nSome of this is unavoidable. But there are 2 things you can and should do to protect yourself. \n\n1. NEVER volunteer up any information that you've had a drinking problem EVER. To anyone. Why hand it out on a silver platter. In addition, if you ever get confronted about past events, you can either deny it or play it down. \n\n2. Be careful how you turn down offers to drink. Always drive yourself to venues, and you're golden. On the rare occasions you don't or find yourself in situations where you're expected to drink, just say you're on medication. Don't come out with the whole \"Oh I never drink\". People will not respect you, they'll just gossip about you saying yeah he's an ex-alcoholic. \n\nNow having said all that, I would also like to make another point. These same assholes who believe they have the moral high ground actually don't. You're the one after all who has woken up from Candy land while they still continue to drink and get up to all kinds of shit. The same kind of shit you used to get up to, remember? All the cringe, all the regrets, the broken relationships, the fights, the regrets, the guilt. With alcohol to some degree, all of this is unavoidable. \n\nAnother thing I would like to say is drinking isn't inherently immoral. It's not like you were stealing, murdering or raping. Most people who end up with drinking problems have problems. I'll even say originating from childhood, or other forms of trauma. This NEVER made you a bad person. How you behaved on alcohol, others will not understand nor ever be able to attribute to the alcohol. But you're not a bad person, never were. \n\nLastly, you have fuck all to be ashamed of neither should you be apologetic to people who hardly know you, who weren't there for the long haul who've made some basic assumptions. They're most likely self projecting and judge you because they're terrified of making the same mistakes. \n\nSo be smart about it.",

Have you seen people try and in that case is it generally a bad decision?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm the type of person who when I drink, I usually do until I pass out. I've lived several blackouts already and also puked (although less often than blackouts). I am 23, started drinking around 17 yo.The only notable exception is with my parents, I am very careful not to overdue it.\n\nAnyway, I had not had a blackout since Fall and avoid drinking as much as possible because I'm scared. However, I bought a beer after exams to celebrate for example (and drank only one). \n\nI'm just unsure if trying to drink moderately is too dangerous a path to take, or if I should just avoid drinking completely to avoid more trouble in the future. Also, idk if it's important to note but I am not publicly identified as alcoolic (maybe behind my back who knows) and even internally I have trouble concluding to alcoolism or accepting it, I don't want to downplay the struggles of those who had it way worst than me...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, thank you for reading, just asking the question propped even more reflections",

I didn't expect to quit but I ended up in the hospital being told I have hepatitis of the liver at the age of 29. My husband was there with me when I found out and looked just as mortified as I did. Right before the hospital I was waking up at 8am and taking shots of vodka and continuing around 15-20 shots a day, sometimes more. A little backstory- I have anxiety issues, panic disorder, hypochondria and almost my entire family is alcoholics and most deaths were alcohol-based. The fact that I've been scared of death or being sick my entire life, yet drinking myself to illness is a demon that is hard to battle with. The second day of detox I had full DTs. My entire body was trembling, rocking back in forth, I was making no sense, I had hallucinated harder than the last time I had done psychedelics...like 8 years ago, the vomiting was intense and every couple of minutes and I couldn't stay hydrated. I was sure I wanted to kill myself. \n\nYet, I pushed through, somehow. I tested myself almost sadistically by going to four of my favorite drinking spots this past week. Didn't touch a drop of alcohol. Thought about it, of course, but got over it pretty quickly. My body and mind were so dependent on alcohol and every event was a drinking event, hell going to the grocery store was a \"drinking event\". But here I am ten days later, going places I love to drink, alcohol currently sitting in my house &amp; I'm stone cold sober. I can't describe this feeling. I feel like a new person and my body feels like a fucking athletes body (it's not, haha), my skin gained its color and moisture back, I can make art again without trembling or muscle spasms, i can cook and clean again. Everything has a purpose now and although that trip to the hospital wasn't the greatest news, in a weird way, I'm glad it happened.",

I drink 12 beers a night and if there's more, I'll drink more. I've tried moderation, I've tried tapering and the fact is... if I could do either of those successfully I wouldn't be an alcoholic. I've definately had stints of sobriety and I felt fucking wonderful... it's just tackling that first day without alcohol that I've found is always the step I dread taking and the step I drag my feet in taking. Just looking for some encouragement I guess and wanted to write my feelings down. I've been a lurker for awhile and I am hoping to be able to rely on this community to keep me strong throughout this process. if anyone has any advice or words of encouragement lay it on me... I'll definately be reading them once WD start to kick in lol.",

I have previously been prescribed Naltrexone a few years ago and have tried it and then stopped it because I didn't want to \"miss out\" on the fun of my weekend drinking.  I know this sounds dumb, right?  The last time I had some drinks was last Friday night.  The reason I want to quit drinking is because on Tuesday and Wednesday, after I drink on a Friday and/or Saturday, I get completely brain-fogged, stupid, and super anxious.  This hinders my job performance and the ability of being who I really am.\n\nAnyways, I can't handle the fact I feel so dumb and can't think clearly so I decided that was it and started taking Naltrexone again on Tuesday (50mg a day since).  \n\nI have read online and seen some videos that people actually drink while taking Naltrexone to retrain their brain to not like alcohol.  I guess that's what it does and also supposed to stop the cravings.  \n\nMy question is, for those who have tried Naltrexone, did you have more success with drinking or without?  I am not trying to make an excuse to drink; however, I am traveling with work tomorrow through the middle of the week and would like to retrain my brain into not liking alcohol, if that's what Naltrexone is intended for.  \n\nThanks!",

I have had a couple slips since coming out of detox and being in daily therapy/treatment and I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s acceptable but I\u2019ve really made some great progress overall\n\nOther then validation from either people in group and meetings that I really don\u2019t have a long-standing relationship with or counselors who it\u2019s part of their job  to validate I pretty much feel like the only time anyone says anything is when I screw up.  Specifically my wife. \n\nIf I self admit the slip I get dressed down for that from my SO. If I keep my mouth shut and it\u2019s asked and I admit it (and I always have) I get it then too from her. \n\nLatest example on what happened is she has a bottle of wine in the wine fridge that was already open. I moved the wine fridge into the garage because it needed to be defrosted. I took a couple swigs from an open bottle and put it in a different fridge. This evening she then accused me of opening the bottle as if it wasn\u2019t opened  as being new (which I didn\u2019t) and that this isn\u2019t fair to her and it\u2019s going to lead to a full blown relapse on my end. \n\nI\u2019m sick of people who aren\u2019t going through this at the level I\u2019m trying to and don\u2019t have a clue on how it feels crawling up my ass and criticizing every mistake and never giving me any credit when I go a period of days on end with out a screw up. \n\nThis is the hardest thing I have ever had to do. SO is a nurse in labor and delivery so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because she\u2019s delivered babies to addicts she thinks it makes her some kind of expert on addiction but she isn\u2019t. \n\nShes made zero effort to go to AlAnon meetings too that I have asked for her to try on numerous occasions. \n\nI\u2019m just so frustrated. Any one else have this going on? Any ideas?",

My ex bf of 2 years and I have been trying to work on things after a year of not speaking. In that year I moved to a different state, and we didn\u2019t speak. He had a different girlfriend and was mostly not sober during that time. He\u2019s now been sober since mid February but he was struggling for the last week. Last night he went out, ignored all my calls and texts for nearly 12 hours and drank. I felt completely helpless and scared because there is so little I can do from 400 miles away. My point is that I really do not want to live like that and need him to be sober long term, on his own before I continue a relationship with him. I\u2019m nervous that my telling him this will set him off and continue a bender. I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m looking for, I just don\u2019t have anyone in my life I can talk to.",

The last 2-3 weeks I have fallen backwards into the deepest pits I have been in due to realisations that I was abused as a child and memories that have resurfaced that were previously repressed + my mother told me the she had gone through the same experience recently (we have been so inter-generationally abused, a recent realisation) and have been informed she and my sister have tried to kill themselves. I am really struggling atm because I have been so stone hard in my conviction not to drink because my reasoning has always been \u2018I can handle the shitty feelings, the noise will not help\u2019 but at the moment I feel like I can\u2019t apply that mantra. It has been 4 weeks of drinking (only at night, but at very large amounts so higher functioning) and it is taking a toll but no body is noticing and I don\u2019t know what to do because I have no support network e.g. psych and friends and family to support me and nobody can tell I\u2019m not okay because my drinking does not effect my performance but I am worried for my life honestly. I have gone to AA but find the religious aspect difficult considering my history of sexual abuse in the church and I\u2019m just struggling. I just don\u2019t know what to do and my alcoholic brain keeps justifying the drink",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nSo I've been debating on whether or not to post this for a fair few weeks now...basically I'm just asking for some advice and opinions on my situation from an outside source.   \n\n\nSo I'm a 21 year old female in the UK. I'm currently a second year university student, and this is where a lot of the issues arise from: the whole 'student binge-drinking culture' within the UK. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically, both my aunt and my grandfather (her father) are/were horrific alcoholics: I never met my grandfather but I've heard awful stories about how he coped with his PTSD from the war with drinking; my aunt has been in-and-out of rehab for alcoholism several times. This has led me to have a difficult relationship with the word 'alcoholic'.   \n\n\nAs far as my history is concerned:\n\nMy mother was horrifically depressed when I was a teenager, and her untreated mental health issues resulted in emotional, and often physical, abuse. One of the things she did though, is in her quest for trying to make friends, would buy us alcohol. I did not want to drink. At all. And often did not. But one time I vividly remember my boyfriend at the time was round and she was downstairs with us at about 11pm, and had a go at me for not drinking the vodka and orange juice that she made me...I was fourteen.   \n\n\nWhen I went to university in September 2017, I wasn't much of a drinker. Even from when I turned 18, I could count the amount of times I drank alcohol on one hand, and I'd never been drunk. After a very messy first ever night out in a night club, I more or less didn't drink again until the December.   \n\n\nDue to the university strikes that happened at the start of 2018, I didn't have any lectures to attend. So me and my friend started going on a bit more over those months. Apart from one incident when I was spiked, I would get nothing more than a bit tipsy, and never ever sick or blackout/brownout drunk; I was always in control, but just a bit merry. That was until I started getting more and more involved with my university's LGBT+ society, as during this time I was trying to figure out what my sexuality really was.   \n\n\nI started going out more and more, but still never got out of it. Over the summer, I stopped going out at all as I was working and most people had gone home. It wasn't until a random night in late September that I had a weird experience: I'd drank two ciders at pre-drinks and, for some reason, I reacted really badly. I was sick before we even left for the nightclub, and I don't remember much from that night. That was the first night that that had happened though, and it didn't happen again for a while, but I stopped drinking that cider as a result because I recognised that it made me ill.   \n\n\nHowever, October changed a lot for me. I received a phonecall a couple of days before my birthday, asking me to go round to one of my friend's houses. There, I was told that one of our mutual close friends had vanished on a night out the night previously. Sadly, it turns out he had taken his own life. We were all distraught. His funeral was about three weeks later, and it was the first one that I'd ever attended. My boss, however made me work later that day, and as a result to cope I drank quite a lot of gin at the wake and then went into work because I couldn't cope with my emotions - but no one seemed to notice and then it never happened again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then ran for the open position of Social Secretary on the LGBT+ society because I felt it was so important to have non-alcoholic socials. As a result, I became very good friends with the girl that lived with my friend who had passed away, and who was the President of the society. She was lovely, but an absolute mess: she turned up to committee meetings drunk, and was constantly blackout on every night out. I became closer and closer with her, and that was the start of a very intense emotional affair.   \n\n\nThe more I hang out with her, the more I drank. The first time I stayed at her flat, we ended up drinking so much that neither of us could get out of bed the next day till 5pm when we had to leave for meetings. I thought this was a one-off...it was not. Every time I saw her, we drank. I went from barely being able to get through one glass of prosecco, to regularly drinking two bottles to myself before going on a nightout - where I'd then drink more. She'd bitch at me for not drinking enough, or drinking light drinks like VKs (alchopops), so I started drinking gin and other spirits more and more often. I cooked her a Christmas meal and bought two bottles of prosecco for the two of us because I thought it would be enough, but we ended up going out to buy two more. In my position as Social Secretary, people would laugh and make jokes about me drinking.   \n\n\nI had confided in another friend back in November, before I met the other girl, that people kept calling me an alcoholic because of that ONE night out that I was sick, and it upset me so much because of my aunt and grandfather, and also because it makes light of true alcoholism - as is the way with a lot of students making jokes about it.   \n\n\nAs time went on with this girl, my drinking got worse. I had to stay up one night and my response was to go on a night out and buy copious amounts of jaegerbombs to make sure I woke up on time; I started finding that I would get up early if I drank, which I really liked because I've always struggled with getting up early. At one point in December, I was only at my flat to sleep for about four hours because I'd either be on a night out (like three times a week) or I'd be drinking with her in her flat. I went to Wetherspoons with her once before a meeting, and we both turned up drunk. I stayed at hers on New Year's Eve when we started dating properly, and we had several bottles of alcohol between us for breakfast the next day. I saw her a few days later and she said she hadn't drank that day...and as a result, had the shakes and a bad migraine. She told me that her therapist had been trying to get her diagnosed officially as an alcoholic for weeks, but she didn't want to (apparently she since has accepted the diagnosis, but is still drinking.  \n\n\nThis really came to a head at the end of January. We went out for a pub brunch together with the parents of our friend that had died. Our friend's Dad tried to buy me a drink and would not take no for an answer, so I ended up asking for a cider - the same type that made me ill all those months before. I found it so hard to firmly say no to my friend's Dad, and I ended up having about ten pints. The result of that was that I was so drunk, I accidentally knocked a whole pint over this girl by accident, went home, and threw up in my kitchen. I only got home at 10pm, and I had been drinking since lunchtime.   \n\n\nSince then, things have only gotten worse. We broke up, and it sent me into a terrible depression. As things got nastier and nastier, I drank more and more. On Valentine's Day, I started drinking the night before, day drank a bottle of prosecco, went to work, then drank another two bottles of prosecco. The next day, I drank another two bottles and went on a nightout where I drank even more.   \n\n\nThere have been several times recently that I've been on a nightout and hysterically cried my eyes out because of the situation/my friend that passed away/other issues. One night there was a particularly big argument with another friend about this girl, and I had to get walked home in tears; if I hadn't have been walked home, I don't think I would have got back in one piece. Then, when I'd been taken home, I blacked out and came to at 4am attempting to self-harm.   \n\n\nSince then, five recent instances really stand out: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. I said I wasn't going to drink on a particular night out. I was at the pub, drinking coke, for five minutes before I felt like Spongebob in that episode where he's sweating and screaming 'I NEED IT'. I caved, and bought a couple of drinks. I find it hard to say no, and hard to stop once I start. \n2. I hadn't eaten before going out because I thought we were going for food first. My boss egged me on to drink and kept laughing at me for saying I didn't want to...so I caved. I ended up blacking out like I've never blacked out before....I'm a lesbian, and I ended up making out with a random man in a club. Then begged my boss to take me to the club where all of my friends were. One of them, that seemed to have a bit of a thing for me, said she'd take me home. She did...but not to my home. I fell asleep on her sofa, so she poured water over me and told me to go to bed. She took me to bed, and I was so drunk I fell off and got stuck between it and the chair. I found out the next morning that I was texting one of my friends and begging him to come and get me. The last thing I remember is her saying: \"I don't want to take advantage\", and me saying \"Yeah, sure, it's fine!!!!\" when it so clearly wasn't because I was just that drunk.   \n\n3. I went to a foam party on Easter Sunday. The result of that was a random girl came up to me and started kissing me, and we ended up having sex in the toilets. I've never done anything like that before, it was very out of character for me and very risky. \n4. I went on a karaoke night on Monday night, and I thought I was fine. Apparently I misheard my friend saying he wanted to get crisps from Tesco as 'coke'. He said he hoped I meant the drink, and apparently I did not and went on a tangent saying I wanted to try cocaine (which I do not remember saying at all, and which is awful as I've always been very against that kind of thing). \n5. This is the worst one...I forgot to book tickets for the midnight showing of Endgame, so I decided to book to see the 3:30am showing because I really like Marvel and I've been waiting for that film for years. I was really tired though...so I decided to go on a night out and wait until then. The only thing is, I drank a copious amount of 43% gin. I could barely stand up, and I've been told since that my friends didn't think I would even be able to get in to the club. The result was that I was so drunk I couldn't stand up straight in the bathroom, slumped against the wall, and slipped over. I smacked my head so hard on the tiled floor that I blacked out, I do not remember how I got back up the stairs and outside, and I didn't recognise my flatmate's boyfriend for five minutes after they found me. They took me to A&amp;E and I have a concussion and whiplash that is still so bad it still hurts now. I was signed off from work for two weeks, and the pain was so bad at one point that I considered downing gin just to knock myself out because the paint was so bad.   \n\n\nWhat I'm asking for, is some advice. I'm finding it really hard to tell if this is traditional student culture that I'll grow out of, or if I'm alcohol dependent, or an actual alcoholic. The issue is that my ex-girlfriend is an alcoholic and has gone around telling everyone that I WANT to be called an alcoholic because I'm 'trying to steal her identity' which is preventing me from wanting to talk about it with people because I don't know what is up with me. When I first stopped drinking a couple of weeks ago because I was prescribed co-codamol, I found it really hard: because I couldn't drink, I wanted to so badly. But after about a week I was fine..even if now I am drinking like I was before. My parents are really worried, ironically, but then if I got tipsy once in a month they would panic, so with everyone's reactions around me, I'm struggling to evaluate what is up with me - hence why I'm being honest on here and seeking help and opinions from outside people. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR: I was a social drinker, started dating an alcoholic that pressured me into drinking a lot, and now I ended up in A&amp;E with a concussion and whiplash due to be intoxicated. I'm trying to get outside opinions on whether it's just student culture (not that that is still good), or if I'm alcohol dependent/an alcoholic.   \n\n\nI know this was a huge essay, so I'm sorry in advance!!!",

            "selftext": "Hey all, today is my 11th month sober.  Alcohol started crippling my life at the age of 14, and I continued to drink until last year(I am now 28 as of Sunday). From the ages of 19+ I drank until I blacked out everyday. This usually took about a liter or more of hard alcohol. Getting sober was the absolute best thing I have ever done for myself and my loved ones to the date. During my venture into sobriety I lost my long term girlfriend, my dog got diagnosed with terminal cancer, I was forced to move out of my house, and a slew of family issues came up I had never faced while being sober. Times like these tested every ounce of my fortitude, and every time I either thought about, or physically reached for a bottle. Every time I told myself that the outcome would leave me more disappointed in myself than I had ever been. Today I am down 80 pounds, have moved into a new place, gone back to school and am pursuing a career field that makes me happy. Through all of this I have taken my sobriety as my number one priority. It has been the hardest thing I have ever done in my life, filled with fear, regret, shame, and despair along the journey. That being said I would not change it for the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, if you are out there struggling; know this, the journey is long and never easy. However, the outcome will make you see life in a whole new perspective. Getting sober is hard because as alcoholics we choose to fight our battles with the help of alcohol, rather than face them head on. Sobriety is enlightening, and fighting against issues sober is the most rewarding(and frightening) thing you can achieve. The road is tough, and sometimes it may not seem worth it; but I promise you it is. 11 months ago the doctor told me while I was in the hospital if I ever drank again I would probably not make it to the end of the year. What did I do? I went home and poured myself a drink while I thought about if making it to the end of the year was worth it, I got sicker and sicker until I finally decided to go dry.  The point of this post is not to flaunt my success(because we are all capable of slipping or relapsing), but to tell you that no matter what life throws at you, if you truly want to find sobriety you can; and I promise you, once you do-you will never look back.  If you're on the edge about it, take the leap, if it scares you, go boldly, if you're nervous, remember to take it one day at a time. Every day sober is a blessing you can't understand until you live it. I wish you all the best of luck; thank you for reading, and my DM's are open to anyone who ever needs to talk.",

            "selftext": "So this is going to be my way of reaching out for support. I appreciate you attempting to read my story.\n\nSo here's my story.\n\nI am a 25/M/UK\n\nI had a mentally,physically,sexually &amp; emotionally abusive upbringing. I didn't have many friends at school and the ones i did have used to bully me. My abuse started when I was 4 years old after my parents got divorced and my ''mother'' had other boyfriends. They would be violent &amp; my ''mother'' wouldn't do anything about it ,or even show a bit of comfort towards me growing up. \n\nWhen I was 16 years old I was set free from home abuse. My mums boyfriend of 8 years left my mother for he's daughter(who he got pregnant) and I started college to study music.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI met some really close friends at college and we all smoked weed religiously. I was finally able to expand my mind &amp; connect with people on a deeper level, as well as pursue my talents within music. I rarely went ''home'' because I felt at home with my friends. My ''mother'' re-married, and the guy is perfect for her. I really got on with him, and they have their own children together now. But I always had this hatred for her that I couldn't shake off. \n\nOnce I left college after 3 years I was living at home still &amp; needed to get a job, or I was told I would be on the street. But I was so introverted and had no 'real world' independence. I just smoked weed and hung with my friends. I would often feel suicidal, and somewhat embrace/ prepare for my death mentally. This is when I first started to feel the depression &amp; anxiety. I did manage get a few jobs, but I didn't stick at them too long as I wouldn't get up for them. I would just turn my alarm off and make an excuse to my ''mother'' and smoke weed all day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years went by and I got into contact with one of my ex girlfriends. I stayed with her a lot, but her family were anti drug BIG TIME! My gf's mum drinks alcohol (still to this day, and i could imagine she has for years) every single night. She would drink 4-6 cans of beer each night. But I couldn't smoke weed, I had to sneakily smoke it at my friends house. \n\nA few months of seeing my ex -now current gf, she fell pregnant. I was shocked at first but they had warmed me to the idea of having a child. So I lived with them full-time but I couldn't be my stoner self. So I took on her mums habit of drinking every single night. It started off with a coupe pints of stella, but sometimes I would drink up to 6 pints. religiously every-night. It was psychologically addictive to feel numb and suppress my mind. At this point I was still jobless, I didn't have much if any contact with my family and I was anticipating my child's arrival. My gf wasn't emotionally there for me so I felt isolated, but at-least I had beer every night and would occasionally be given a joint to smoke by my friends.\n\nAnyway without going into too much detail of our relationship. Within the time of my childs birth to when she hit 1 years old I managed to get a job (as a end of life care assistant)which I was really good at but it drained my soul. I also left my childs mother &amp; moved in with my old primary school friends dad. He would smoke weed and pop pills at raves so I was able to smoke weed in bed . But I was still addicted to drinking alcohol. \n\nAfter the novelty wore off after a few months, he's true colours started to show and he would sometimes get aggressive, which made me feel like I was that lonely child again. I wasn't able to have my child stay with me because I refused to have her around that environment. My childs family would tell me '' you might as well not be a parent'' because I was working so much and didn't have much time with my child. It got to the point were I felt so lonely I would isolate myself in my bedroom, smoke weed and sneak out to buy alcohol. I didn't even go to the kitchen to make food. I lost a lot of weight. All I did was make music, I have a fear of talking on the phone so I just didn't turn up for work. Had so many AWOL's they let me go. So being now jobless and felt more lonely than ever, I moved out of that guys house and moved in with my nan(who I am currently staying with). \n\nThat was February 2018. Its now May 2019. \n\nSince moving in with my nan I was able to spend a lot more time with my child but had no income so I had to go on job seekers( still currently on it). I was drinking &amp; smoking weed more than ever though, still suppressing my own thoughts. Late last November , I had so many bottles of alcohol in my room I had 3 black bags full of them, and that was only 2 months worth of drinking. Imagine how much alcohol I had consumed since October 2015 when I had moved in with my ex. When I was taking one of the black bags to the recycling bin 5 minutes away from me (in the middle of the night obvcourse) the bag had split open. The sound of smashing glass echoed the street and I just ran as fast as I could. It was wrong of me to have just left it there but how could I face that mess. The mess was there for a couple weeks and I suppose the council cleaned it up (thank you local council). \n\n I was referred to resources plus last September.( They help jobless adults get back into work as well as support with other things). I had expressed my alcohol addiction to my advisor early last December and he told me to go to ''The pier road project''(who help people stop drinking &amp; taking drugs).  December 24th I had brought a litre bottle of vodka which I  had planned on drinking throughout the christmas period. I had a hangover christmas day, I had started to drink again christmas night, I had a hangover boxing day, started drinking that night. The next day (27th) I was supposed to pick up my daughter from her great nans at 1pm. I woke up about 8am,dehydrated and felt extremely sick. I couldn't go back to sleep. Every time I did fall back to sleep my body would wake me up because I had felt that ill. It got to about 12.30pm and I had left to pick up my child. Once I arrived I felt awful, but I had told them I was fine and left to go back home. But walking back I kept feeling the urge to be sick. My child asking questions every two seconds ''what this, whats that'' made me feel so much worse. I then called her great grandmother and told her I couldn't even make it home so could she picked my child up. As they picked her up, her great grandmother was crying, saying I needed to sort my life, I felt so awful, all I could think about was going back to bed.\n\nI then didn't drink alcohol until new years night. I had a good evening, I paced myself, got indoors about 6am. A week or so later I had gone to my mates house. I comfortably smoked a tiny joint to myself, and noticed my friend had some beers on the side. I had asked to drink one. I drunk it, then I asked for another one. Once I finished drinking it we started to play a game of PUBG. But mid game I felt this overwhelming sense of dread overcome me and I had to leave hastily. On my trip home I couldn't shake off this sickness feeling. I had to get off the train 1 stop before and walk the rest of the way. I was getting so frustrated that I couldn't make myself feel better. I then got into bed and then realised I needed to stop drinking alcohol immediately! I then made plans to go to Pier road project soon after. I arrived nervous as anything but I was determined to stop my habit. Baring in mind I still smoked weed at this point, I didn't feel like it was an issue in my life. Mid January I became abstinent. I went to Alcoholics anonymous meetings and felt like I was fine for the first week. \n\nUntil My anxiety came back with lethal vengeance\n\nI couldn't hang with my friends, I couldn't be around anybody without feeling this urge to be sick. Its like this rush of dis-association, and I needed to be alone otherwise I would be sick. I worked out it was because I was suppressing all my anxiety and depression all these years, and to feel at ease I had to go to my ''comfort'' space, which was to isolate myself as I once was growing up. I still remained alcohol free. For 1month and a few days. \n\nI remember going to Tesco after my job centre appointment, picking up 1 bottle of beer, going up to the self checkout,beeping my bottle, and then the machine just froze.... All I wanted to do was to get in and out as quick as possible but the machine had actually frozen completely. So then I had to ask for help ,and there was this big fuss over the machine breaking and I had to go to the till assistant to buy the beer. ( I know this was basically my ''god'' telling me to not buy that beer, but I did anyway). I then got home, made plans to see my friend in a few hours and cracked open my beer. I then drunk it all after a couple hours, then the depression hit me. I had a massive headache and the alcohol had actually made me so depressed. Not because I had broken my nearly 5 week streak, but the physical effects of alcohol made me feel so low. I then messaged my friend and cancelled. I just laid in bed contemplating life. \n\nsince mid February Ive probably drunk under ten times. I feel like being sobar and not feeling sick with anxiety is my ''high''. Ive been put off alcohol as it just gives me a headache now.\n\nA few weeks into February I got introduced to CBD oil and camomile tea to calm my crippling anxiety. I also always have really strong chewing gums to help me when i feel the wave of anxiety coming on. Before I started taking the CBD oil I had a bag of weed in my drawer I hadn't smoked for a few weeks.( I couldn't handle being anxious on top of smoking weed so I kept it in my drawer). I had read that drugs and CBD can compliment each other so I had decided to roll a little joint out of the bag. I couldn't believe how great I felt. No anxiety at all. I walked to the shops, even managed to have a conversation with the cashier. I felt so great. A few days of that excitement I got to my last joint in the bag. I had smoked half of it, walked to Mcdonalds,walked home, ate my food and had half a joint left. I then went outside to smoke the last of it, came indoors and then it hit me...Like A tonne of bricks. The wave of anxiety sickness struck me. I then I quickly put on my clothes and shoes and hastily left my house to go for a walk. I walked around my park (baring in mind this was about 11pm) and it was raining heavily. I walked around the park and then I realised something... That was my last ever joint. The excitement I had felt with not feeling anxious with CBD and weed was my ''gods'' way of letting me have some fun before I gave up entirely. I then walked home and went to sleep after analysing the event.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince February 26th to now, I have successfully completed a ''Preparing to work in adult social care course lvl 1'' which was 6 weeks of me going to class with other people for 12 hours per week,3 out of 5 weekdays. ( which in my previous state would have never have done) Ive had therapy sessions once a week for the past 9 weeks and ive gained alot of clarity on what I want out of life. I want to become a councillor myself. I have along way to go before I can achieve that goal but I feel very optimistic about the future.\n\nI still get waves of anxiety sickness,sometimes very overwhelming but I am getting a lot better at stopping them. The tea and chewing gum help a great deal. And I feel comfortable with alcohol now. I haven't drunk for about a month, I just don't feel like drinking! I havn't smoked a single joint since that event happened. I have put myself in new and uncomfortable situations so I can build up a tolerance to being in social situations.\n\nBeing sobar has been so tough. Learning to deal with my inner emotions and deeply imbedded demons sobar has been one of the hardest challenges I have ever come across. And i know I have along way to go but I am doing it! I need to get a job and a home. I am soon to be homeless and Ive been lucky so far to have a roof over my head so I could get this far but I really need to start dealing with my other issues. But so far alcohol and weed have left my daily habits, and learning to deal with raw emotions is how I wish to live my life. Not being addicted to substances.\n\nI realised how much I drank was actually disgusting. I would sometimes go to pick up my child, go to Morrisons, go to the pier with her and drink an entire bottle of lambrini (the mega big ones), come home and casually cook dinner. I cant even fathom drinking that much alcohol now let alone just before dinner. I feel so appalled at how much I drank but now I am at a comfortable level. I enjoy being sobar and not feeling anxiety. Learning to live sobar, love myself, pursue my hobbies &amp; career choices and being an ideal parent is all I need in life\n\nThank you so much for reading my story, If you need any help or advise just send me a message please!\n\nIf you have any guidance for me I would really appreciate a comment or PM. I can do with as much support as possible, and I can offer my support to anybody needing it. Just reach out to me",

I agreed to cut down but have began increasingly drinking a beer or two and hiding half bottles of my precious Buckfast in between when she's not in the room, encouraging her to take baths all this shit.\n\nI'm well aware this is classic alcoholic behaviour and I am keen to change. However my issue at present is different and probably petty.\n\nI had a half bottle hidden under the sofa and came home to a clean house. She found the bottle and it's gone but she's hasn't mentioned anything and encouraged me to get a bottle of Buckfast tonight.\n\nBasically I'm anxious I've been busted big time and it's a quiet sort of torture. Any words? Cheers.",

            "selftext": "I got to the point where FINALLY I realized that I can't drink socially like other people. For a long time, I lied to myself, thinking that after stopping for 4 days that I wasn't dependent. And I would think it safe to drink again. Amazing the lies an addict can tell himself. I had to hit bottom which for me was going through 'a handle' of booze every 4 days, and starting to drink at 8AM, forgoing coffee for a month straight. Years ago I stopped smoking and that was really hard, so I presumed to quit booze would be similar. The first 3-5 days were hell. Today I am on day 18 and things are better, though the cravings are still there but not as bad. I quit smoking 30 years ago, and even to this day I occasionally think it would be nice to smoke a butt. But I won't. I suspect I will feel similarly in the coming years about booze.  But booze will not be an option...To get through almost 3 weeks w/o booze I give some credit to Gabapentin, a medication that mimics alcohol in the way it interacts w the brains GABA receptors - where dependence takes place. Maybe this is something that others will find helpful.",

            "selftext": "I have a question about my loved one planning a time to detox and would like input from others who are familiar with how this works better than I am.\n\nMy alcoholic partner is in AA and has a sponsor and wants to get sober. He says he is a \u201cmaintenance drinker\u201d and has 4-5 drinks a day (probably actually more than that). He says he can\u2019t stop drinking without detoxing first due to his very physically and emotionally draining job. \n\nHe wants to plan a trip with his paid time off to his sister\u2019s place in the mountains to detox. He says being in that environment with loved ones and time to be in nature will help him have a better experience than if he were just at home. He would go to meetings every day and be in touch with his AA friends. He said he has talked to lots of (long-term sober) people in AA about whether he should go to rehab, and almost everyone says it\u2019s a big waste of money and doesn\u2019t work. I\u2019d love to save money, we don\u2019t have the money for it anyway! \n\nBut my immediate reaction is wow what an irresponsible plan, plus roping others into taking care of him who are already dealing with their own issues, especially me whose life has been wrapped around his alcoholism for years now, as well as our 5yo. He doesn\u2019t have a doctor and says that he doesn\u2019t drink enough for unsupervised detox to be a real threat to his health. And if he needs to go to the hospital he will be able to.\n\nI told him he needs to consult a doctor about this if he wants me to be there with him. I\u2019m not his babysitter and neither is his family. We all have issues with codependency and he doesn\u2019t need to add this burden onto us. But apparently his sister is all for it.\n\nI want to support him in recovery and taking steps toward sobriety, but I\u2019m worried if we go forward with this and we all go together it\u2019s going to be a hellish week and I do NOT want our \u201cvacation time\u201d to be yet another time centered around his problem with alcohol. \n\nWe really need to work this out because it has to happen within the next month due to his work responsibilities. But I\u2019m having a hard time being patient with him because I think it\u2019s a very poorly thought-out plan. Any input is greatly appreciated.",

When I'm drunk, I don't want to get sober ever again. It feels SO GREAT to be drunk. To not give a fuck about most things. I love that feeling like nothing else.\n\nFor 18 years I have lived in a country where alcohol is prohibited. Then I have moved to my country with my family 3 years ago. I started smoking first. After 3 years later I'm a heavy smoker today. Then I have started drinking. But alone. I didn't used to go out much. There was nothing for me outside. Eventually I began going outside to just smoke. I started making new \"friends\". Today I know a reasonable amount of people in my area. But I don't have a best friend, neither a girlfriend. There are just some people I know. And sometimes they make me feel bad. So I just desire alcohol more.\n\nI started drinking outside. From beers to shots. And just a couple of days ago I have bought a flask. And now I'm finishing a bottle a day. I'm using the money my dad gives me for college which I don't go.\n\nI think I'm heading towards to something bad. I'm aware of this.

I also don\u2019t know if the anxiety is still from withdrawal symptoms or something else. I\u2019m afraid of how I\u2019ll feel when I stop the gabapentin.\n\nHas anyone transitioned from gabapentin to a long term anxiety med/SSRI successfully?

            "selftext": "A little background: I\u2019m 32, I started drinking at 18 and REALLY started drinking at 21, I was pretty much drunk every night until I turned 32.  Before I started drinking I was fit and a comfortable 175 lbs.  Now I slap my stomach and the Mexican wave stops in the middle of my back.  I have love handles that would make Beyonc\u00e9 blush.  Just before I stopped drinking in March I was 190 lbs. When I was drinking I never ate sugar, never drank soda, never ate dessert. I just ate lunch and dinner, and drank my dessert ( actually I just drank all day most days). I heard all these stories of people losing 20-30 lbs by giving up booze... this was not the case for me. 64 days later I\u2019m 200 lbs.  Sodas, ice cream, peanut m&amp;ms... I can eat the SHIT out of some peanut m&amp;ms.  When I buy a bag of m&amp;ms on my way home they sit there in the grocery bag glowing like the one ring.  3 months ago if someone offered me a donut at work I would have told them to get the hell away from me , now I eat 1-4 of them.  I don\u2019t crave sugar, but I can\u2019t seem to stop buying sodas when I\u2019m in the chilled beverage isle (coincidentally right next to the beer).  The fucked up thing is I hate sugar, I know how terrible it is for my health and physique, but for some reason I eat it anyway.  I guess it\u2019s just like drinking a fifth a night knowing it\u2019s terrible for my health, but saying fuck it I\u2019ll stop starting tomorrow.  I\u2019m the heaviest I\u2019ve ever been and I haven\u2019t drank a drop in 64 days. I also have started using those tobacco free nicotine pouch things ( I used chew in high school  but quit and didn\u2019t use anything with nicotine again till recently). Am I just replacing booze  with sugar and nicotine?  Am I subconsciously just trying to search for other ways to alter my reality and run away from anxiety?  Damn I wish I could smoke weed... stupid drug tests.  How do you deal with it? Any support is welcome!",

Not surprising given the amount of addiction in my family.\n\nI found myself getting through most days by looking forward to drinking. I would wake up with crippling anxiety after drinking before giving in and start drinking again, and there's the cycle. Girlfriend of 4 years left because of these issues. I had a ring and the full proposal was planned a few weeks from then.\n\nI may not agree with the way she up and left, or the way she approached any of this, but I am choosing to use it as an opportunity to better myself. It was a fork in the road; I could say fuck it and keep doing shots of whiskey without any outside interference, or I could get my shit together. I'm choosing the latter.\n\nI strung together a few 30 day stretches sober after this and felt mostly great; back to the gym, re-motivated at work, more confident. Yet each time ended with a 3-5 day bender. This recent one I managed to ruin a good thing I had built up with a really awesome new person over a few months in the span of 2 drunken days. It's crazy how much alcohol takes from you. I'm trying to get a hold of it before it takes my career, friends, family, my life. I see myself as lucky to still have all that I do to be honest.\n\nI'm back on day 10ish. I'm trying to keep the first 5 days after the most recent relapse fresh in my mind because it is by far the worst I have ever felt, mentally and physically. I've been to a few AA meetings, which I mostly enjoyed, but I just started being active with SMART and that seems more my speed.\n\nAnyways, just wanted to share my story with some likeminded people. Here's to making this sobriety stick.",

The courage to get there is hard and I have a 7 day a week working situation right now. \n\nIt\u2019s a long, arduous story but, my boyfriend solves his problems with whiskey and beer. He drinks in my eyes 6-7 days a week. He would probably say otherwise. He lives with an equally alcohol dependent brother who is currently not a licensed driver. Whiskey is consumed on weeknights and weekends, and beer is usually around although it\u2019s becoming more expensive for them to drink beer. He smells like booze almost every time I see him and it is a major trigger for me. I instantly become cold and distant. Yesterday I found a paper bag from a whiskey bottle in the trash. I didn\u2019t even say anything to him because my efforts are futile. He knows he has a problem, and he knows fully how much of a problem I have with this problem. It\u2019s been made very clear for a few years now....but here I still am. I\u2019m becoming very depressed because my efforts are useless. No matter what I do. Yell, scream, say nothing at all. My future dreams are becoming more distant and that is becoming more apparent so it makes me depressed. I do love him very much, and I want our relationship to move forward but I\u2019m having a hard time trusting we can make this possible if he continues this behavior. I need to be in control here. I have thoughts like \u201cif he loved me he would stop\u201d, \u201che doesn\u2019t care about my feelings at all\u201d, \u201cI\u2019ll never be able to rely on him as a husband or father\u201d. It\u2019s hard having doubts almost 5 years into things. Just sucks. Sorry for the continuing rants. I have very little people to talk about this too because I don\u2019t want people to think badly about him. He\u2019s a great guy, wonderful person, and hard worker.................with one major flaw that will ruin everything.",

            "selftext": "Around 3-4 years ago I went through a bender where I was using alcohol to numb myself emotionally during a deep depression. That lasted around 6-7 months with me getting blackout drunk around 4 times a week. Then once I noticed how much weight I was gaining and overall how much the alcohol was making my depression worse, I forced myself to stop drinking and started going back to the gym, eating healthy, ect. \n\nI drank very infrequently for the next few years but noticed I craved alcohol, which I wasn't sure if that's a normal thing. Sometimes I would get a really overwhelming urge for it, but I wouldn't drink because at the time I'd been 19-20 and couldn't buy it myself. So that made it easy to avoid. \n\nThen when I turned 21 I was really depressed again and was actually really happy I could buy alcohol for myself. I have a little mini fridge that I stock with it and ever since it's never been empty. \n\nLately I've gone through some hard stuff again and I've been turning to alcohol again. I think I have a good handle on it but I worry some times. I have a very low tolerance because I'm a woman and I have a lot of muscle now so killing one bottle of wine will make me drunk into the next day, but I do this a lot. And I regularly have thoughts about how nice it would be to just be drunk all the time, and find myself drinking at any time during the day. Sometimes I wake up and decide being fully aware is too difficult today so I start drinking. Sometimes I feel like I can't stop myself, but then in the same note for instance on days my GERD/IBS acts up I'll avoid drinking because it's too physically painful. \n\nIt's also worth mentioning that both my maternal grandfather and maternal aunt had alcoholism problems and I've seen patterns in even my little brother (16) where for awhile he was drinking to numb his own pain. We had a really tough childhood.\n\nI've tried mentioning it to my therapist but he kinda brushed it off and told me that if I can put the bottle down, then I don't have a problem with alcoholism. \n\nI had an ex boyfriend who was also a recovering alcoholic and drug addict who told me basically the same thing, that the difference between a non-addict and an addict is that the addict doesn't have the choice.\n\nI just wanted some second opinions from the horse's mouth. I'm sorry if I sound ignorant in any way, I just don't know very much about alcoholism",

When I was 17 i got addicted to pills (opiates) and ended up getting clean when I was 19. I began to drink every night soon after due to how my family drinks and always considered myself \u201cclean\u201d.  Years have passed now and I am here drinking between 6-12 beers every night, never liquor. I am in the midst of starting a pressure washing business and I\u2019m finding it\u2019s having the obvious negative effects on both that and my health. I feel overweight, bloated, and gross. I am really trying to quit and I don\u2019t have much of a support system. I put my mom through hell with opiate addiction, so I don\u2019t want her knowing about this. I haven\u2019t experienced much withdrawals except for anxiety and panic attack\u2019s. Also have gone days without drinking just fine, sometimes days at a time but rarely. I have plenty of Naltrexone and 1mg lorazepam to get me through this short life changing journey. Any suggestions to stay out of the house and away from your normal drinking stations? What else has helped distract you and reduce your cravings/reasons to drink? And is it possible to get withdrawals drinking at night only as opposed to all day? Don\u2019t usually feel too bad 12 hours later. Sorry for all the questions thanks!",

I\u2019ve posted a lot in the AlAnon thread, but sometimes just get tired of the \u201ccome to a meeting\u201d response. I know I have to get to one, but right now I\u2019m working 7 days a week and it\u2019s easier said than done....in many ways. I\u2019ve been using Reddit for support, and as a way to vent/get my thoughts out about all of this. \n  \n     I am a 27 year old female, dating a 30 year old man who is wonderful in every way and dependent on alcohol. We met through mutual friends in a bar almost 5 years ago, and spent the beginning of our relationship (very beginning, first few meetings) at a bar to meet. I am obviously not a drinker at all, but definitely drank more socially a few years ago, now hardly at all. I noticed my boyfriends dependence on alcohol pretty early on, and we started having pretty regular conversations/discussions about it after he would go pretty hard on the weekend and spend the majority of the mornings sick. This went on for quite some time, and eventually our conversations around alcohol became more serious, even to this day. I can\u2019t stress of how great of a person he is. He has held a job for many years, doesn\u2019t make great money because of the hours, doesn\u2019t enjoy his work anymore which presents a lot of stress. He has never been abusive or aggressive when inebriated, mainly emotional and unstable. I realized a few years ago that he was hiding bottles around and about....under beds, in closets, or would forget to hide them and when confronted pretends it\u2019s an old one. He also drinks many strong beers, which ends up being almost just as bad. I love this man, I really might have thought I might have found the person I really wanted to spend the rest of my life with, settle down and have a family....but right now I just want to run for the hills and I think that\u2019s what hurts the most. The fact that I want to run from the person I love the most. Both of my parents are alcoholics and my mother has been involved with many alcohol addicted men who have presented nothing but problems in my life/childhood. Every opened bottle I feel my future go down the drain. I\u2019m not sure how much longer I can hold on...my body is starting to go into defense mode and I feel myself pushing him away. Then when I think of that I just cry. I wish I could just make the addiction and dependency  go away. I just want a normal life. I work really hard and I\u2019ve been through a lot, this is just something else to drag through.",

            "selftext": "Since I was 22 (about 6 years ago), I have been abusing alcohol on a regular basis. My favorite is rum. These days I do not even count my pours, I just wait until 5/7 of my cup is filled, then top it off with soda. I have owned a house for 5 years, been married for 4 years, and been in nursing school for 2 years. I can not believe I have held my life together for anywhere near this long whilst being addicted to alcohol. Every time I slip, I feel it down to the bone. I am entirely conscious throughout all of this, but feel completely powerless to control any of it. My wife loves me to the end of the earth. She knows, but chooses to tolerate it and I have no intentions of testing her patience, although addiction will, inevitably, run it's course. My employer is  unaware, but I only can assume they have their suspicions. I am however, their \"golden boy\" so I feel even if they knew they'd work around it (not that I want to find out). I've tried every form of will-power to work my way of this and have failed. Small steps, aromatherapy, I sing in the choir at my church, even self-hypnosis. Nothing has worked. I am to the point the I NEED support. I need people in the same boat as me. That is why I am here. If anyone. Even bystanders feel like commenting on this post I promise I will read everything and take it to the heart. I just seriously need to know that someone, anyone out there is rooting for me.

            "selftext": "First time posting here so thanks for listening and sorry for the length.\n\nMy boyfriend and I have been together for almost 3 years, and we have lived together for almost 1 year. Overall, we are really happy, we have a dog together, and it\u2019s by far the best relationship I\u2019ve ever had.\n\nExcept for the drinking. When he drinks, he is never mean or violent or anything. He just gets sloppy and kind of obnoxious. I don\u2019t want him to stop because of his behavior, but because of his health and the anxiety this causes me.\n\nMy boyfriend goes through a cycle of drinking too much, quitting for a few weeks, then slowly picking back up again until I tell him he\u2019s going to far or until he has a particularly bad hangover. When I say he drinks too much, I mean he can easily drink an entire 6 pack in a night, and last night he drank at least 2 double IPAs (10% BAV) and an entire bottle of wine. It\u2019s as if once he starts drinking he won\u2019t stop until there\u2019s nothing left in the house. He\u2019ll stay up until 4 AM. When he was really drinking heavily, it was half a bottle of gin a night\n\nHis family has a long history of drinking problems (his older brother is a recovering alcoholic, and so are some of his aunts and uncles). When he says he\u2019ll quit after a rough night he always mentions his family, so he\u2019s clearly aware that genetics are at play here.\n\nI have asked him to stop or at least drink less before, and he\u2019s always agreed before slipping back into this habit. He almost saw a therapist once too, but never followed through.\n\nPart of the reason this makes me so anxious is because I grew up with an alcoholic father, and I am very sensitive to other people's drinking habits because of it. I can\u2019t help but count every single bottle he opens when he starts drinking, and when I go to bed before him I just lay awake and worry about how much more he\u2019s going to drink. I don\u2019t think I can live with someone who is going to drink like this for the rest of my life. I should say that I also drink in social settings, maybe 2-4 drinks per week.\n\nI love him so so much, and if you met him you would know that he is so much more than this one part of him, which I truly believe he can overcome. I just need advice on how to talk to him about this, because I am admittedly not great about talking about hard issues, and I usually can\u2019t bring myself to say anything until he\u2019s had a few drinks, which I know is not productive. I also don't want my own issues around alcohol to effect our relationship, and I can't tell if I'm being unreasonable. \n\nAny advice would be appreciated. Thanks guys.\n\nTL;DR: My boyfriend drinks too much sometimes and I need advice on how to talk to him about it. Thanks!",

            "selftext": "A few days ago I was hanging out with my roomates drinking some wine and watching movies. I had too much wine too fast and blacked out about halfway through the last movie we watched. They both went to bed and I didn't. It was really nothing but good times up until that. Then I have just little snipets of memory, I was doing some dishes, then I'm drinking my roomates rum that she keeps in the living room. Then I'm sharpening a knife. Then I'm outside the doorway of roomates room and she's crying while I try to explain myself. Then I'm in the kitchen argueing with my brother, other roomate. I'm told that at this point its about 6 a.m. they probably went to sleep around midnight. Then I'm pinned down on the floor face first with my chin busted open, yelling at my brother calling him all sorts of names and telling him to just let me kill myself. He wouldn't let me up until I calmed down which I did, started crying and saying all kinds of sorries. Once my brother was convinced I wasn't going to hurt myself and go to sleep he let me sleep while the two of them went to get breakfast and talk about what just happened. \nWhen I came to later I saw that I had sent a group chat message to my immediate familly saying basically that I loved them all very much and I'm sorry for the pain this could bring them, but I didn't want to live anymore and I was going to leave. I sent a similar text to one of my few good friends from high school that I keep in touch with. Thats why I was sharpening the knife, no one wants to cut themselves with a dull knife haha. I talked to my fam and freind and assured them I was ok and wasnt going to try anything like that again. I also haven't drink anything since, this was fri night/sat morn. \nOver the next couple days my other roomate gave me more details about the interactions between the two of us that night, which was hard for her to talk about let alone with me. She said that I was making noise and sounded like I fell a few times in the kitchen. Didn't want to check on me but she did. Found he rum out and pretty demolished and we got into it and she grabbed her stuff and what was left in the living room, other bottles, and went to her room. She then realized the flowers she was going to give her mom were still in the kitchen and was worried I could do something to them, which is completely fair. Blackout drunk me didn't agree and was very insulted that she came back to get those. I followed her to her room and she told me to fuck off, pushed me, and closed her door. I opened her door and started walking into her room and obviously she started screaming at me and pushing me out telling me I'm not welcome in here and this is not ok. I was saying I just wanted to talk and she wasn't having it. It got a little physical, like a struggle between us in her doorway. Thankfully I didn't hurt her, well physically, my motor skills were pretty shot and I'm not the strongest dude to begin with. I ended up falling backwards onto our shoe rack and breaking it. At the same time my brother came downstairs. I started crying and saying I was sorry and just wanted to talk. My bro took me into the kitchen and I went for the knife I had sharped to cut myself he grabbed me and got the knife away. There was a lot of yelling and argueing that again I dont remember. Eventually I lunged at him and thats how I ended up pinned on the floor. I'm starting to just tell the whole thing over. Anyaways, since then everyone in the house, we have another roomate that wasn't there, agrees that I need to move and asap.\nI maybe didn't have to tell this whole story but its good to get it out. I feel this sub would understand a bit. \nMy main reason for posting though is this. The places I can move to so abruptly are very limited and most likely I will have to move back in with my mother. Given the area she lives in I will have a difficult time finding some help for my alcoholism that isn't strongly christian based. If thats the only help I can find I'll take it, but I was wondering if there were online resources some of you were aware of that I could utilize. Maybe online support groups idk. I'm not an alcaholic in the sense that I need or feel I need to drink every day, but when I do its hardly ever in moderation. When I'm not smoking weed its usually a couple times a week. I think I'm just getting a little rambly now so I'll end it here. So yeah if anyone has any online resources that I could check out I would greatly appreciate it. I'm going to NW rural Virginia if anyone knows the area and knows of things locally.",

            "selftext": "So I had my third group session today.\n\nThere were 13 people this week, no new faced but there were a few people returning from week one.\n\nAs before we started with introductions and our progress from last week. I said I was drinking slightly less but not by much.\n\nThe topic this week was how to change behaviour. This started with an analysis of the costs Vs benefits of drinking, as in how has drinking positively and negatively impacted us. This might sound weird to some people, but if you don't identify the reasons why you drink in the first place you can't think about how to satisfy those needs in other ways. For example, a lot of people drink for stress control, so identifying other ways of controlling stress can help you cut down.\n\nThen we did an exercise where we discussed how important out of ten it was to us that we stop drinking. I have a score of nine, and other people scored themselves similarly highly. Next we discussed how confident we were out of ten that we could make the changes necessary to cut down. I have a score of three, and most other people scored themselves fairly low too.\n\nNext was a fifteen minute break. In my last post like this I mentioned a new woman that I thought was drinking during the session. She definitely was this week because I saw her pound a strong lager outside. I mention this because one of the difficult things about these sessions is that you will see and interact with people who are worse off than yourself, which can be a difficult and scary thing to see. This center is for all types of addicts, so you regularly see people walking in for methodone, for example.\n\nAfter the break we discussed the cycle of change (http://socialworktech.com/2012/01/09/stages-of-change-prochaska-diclemente/) and then the SMART acronym (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria).\n\nOverall this week felt more positive and less scary than previous weeks.",

            "selftext": "Hey y\u2019all,\n\nI was hoping I could get some advice here.. So mom has a (long) history of alcoholism since her teen years.  Recently she went on a 2 day bender which started after Mother\u2019s Day lunch/dinner with her mom. Pretty sure grandma\u2019s annoying-ness is a trigger for Mom. Any-who, she started off with a bottle of wine, then ended up at her ex\u2019s house who she frequently will drink with, and passed out over there, leaving my two teenage brothers alone for the night, not knowing where she was. She woke up at 4 am Monday morning and continued the party, went on a road trip bar hopping by herself 2.5 hrs away, then came back home. She missed work and didn\u2019t call, but her boss is covering for her (rolling my eyes so hard at this). I guess my grandma got ahold of her at this time after noticing weird charges on her bank account from far away (we both have access) and she was rambling about going to the Harley Davidson dealership to get a new bike. Then she went back home. The oldest of the two boys was getting home from school at that time, Mom had just gotten out of the shower and went to take off again. He took her car keys when he realized she was drunk but couldn\u2019t get her bike keys in time. So, she took off on her bike, he was an absolute mess, balling his eyes out. My grandma shows up and decides the boys will stay at her house. Mom is MIA for hours. We later found out that she was at a bar, found her bike there around 11 pm and one of the guys, thank god a nice one, gave her a ride home. Unfortunately, she was locked out, and decided to knock down the side door, completely off the hinges, which is 100+ years old and original to the house which she is leasing. Her landlord (and fuck buddy/love interest) lives literally right next door (combined duplex) and was obviously pissed when she told him about it the next morning... Grandma called me around 6 pm Monday, I jumped on a flight (I live 1/2 across the country) and made it up here Tuesday at 9:00 am. She made it to work on Tuesday so I was in her house when she made it home, and I\u2019ve parked my happy ass on her couch until we get this shit sorted out. Thankfully, I\u2019m able to work from home/remotely. I was able to talk to her about everything a little yesterday and she was feeling like shit about breaking down the door and her shenanigans. I asked her if she would be willing to get professional treatment, and her response was, \u201cwhatever makes everyone happy.\u201d Obviously that won\u2019t hold long term, if she is just trying to make everyone happy, so I am not sure what else to do here.  She has been sober since Tuesday AM and tries to stay sober, but once she starts, she can be mentally gone for days. \n\nIdeally, I would like her to go into an inpatient rehab center. My fianc\u00e9e and I would take care of the boys for the summer/as long as it\u2019s needed. She works in the school system so she only has 2 weeks left, and the boys only have around 9 days. Really appreciate any advice on how to get her in and make it beneficial. \n\nI should also point out that I am her 25-year old daughter, I have a good relationship with her and we usually see eye-to-eye. If anyone is able to get her into treatment it would be me, because everyone else just pisses her off so she writes them off. I grew up in this shit-show-esque environment and I am able to distance myself emotionally to get it done. \n\nSorry for the formatting, I am on mobile.",

But then last night I had 2 craft beers at 9%, and 1 mixed drink at a friends and I felt great last night, barely felt the buzz. \n\nBut today my symptoms are just as strong as the nights where ai would drink almost a full 750ml of vodka/rum/whiskey. \n\nSymtoms: dizziness, lightheaded, arms flush red occasionally, slight chest discomfort, slightly blurry vision ...these happen once an hour to every couple hours. \n\n.....and all this seems to get worse when I sit down but lessens while I am up walking around. \n\nThese are the same level symptoms that scared me into the ER 7-8 times in the last 2 months, but I drank no where near the same amounts. And every ER visit reads all vitals/CT/blood pressure/ urine and blood samples at normal levels every time I go, do I am holding off on going again today. I am currently at work as a merchandiser for a soda company lifting heavy and constantly up and down on my knees throughout the day.\n\nAs someone who is newly trying to taper and scared about these symptoms, are there any words of encouragement or advice as to what is going on or if this is something other people feel? \n\nAny comforting words would be greatly appreciated.",

            "selftext": "Hello, all. I'm female, 24. For the last two years I've been drinking nearly every day. Two-three beers or two-three glasses of whisky or wine a day. Not too much, but enough to make a difference in my mental state and overall physical and intellectual performance. Since March I've been doing my best to limit my alcohol intake to once a week. A couple of two's and three's a week happened, but it's definitely getting better and for now I won't be drinking anything for another two or three weeks due to my gut problems, so there's that. In the first month my cravings were insane, chamomile tea definitely helped to ease them, but it was still very difficult to not to get up and haul my ass over to local shop to get my precious beer. It's still quite afwul and I would love to get the buzz, but I'm getting there and I definitely want to switch off thinking that alcohol = reward.\n\nBut I've been thinking - how long will it take until my mind gets back to normal? Because I definitely noticed in the last year that my brain performance significantly worsened. I'm having trouble focusing on reading or tasks at hand, I got lazy at work - I'm still doing what I have to, but only that instead of vigorous 100% that I've been giving earlier. My memory needs refreshing, and making connections between facts became difficult. Speech also got impaired and I find it hard to structure a proper sentence. All of that is slowly getting better, but very slowly. I'm on a very healthy diet right now, I don't smoke or do anything else aside from booze. But how long will it take until I regain my brain power? Should I invest in some teas helping with focus? Or do some mind exercises? How long did the brain fog last for you guys?",

I noticed this last night when I was doing shots alone before I went to the bar with friends because I didn\u2019t want them to think badly of me bc of how many drinks I tend to order. I also drink out of boredom a lot. Like currently, I felt incredibly bored today and decided to take a massive pull from a bottle of vodka just to make things more fun. I drink generally every other day. My mother is an on and off alcoholic and I worry about her so much it\u2019s insane, and the idea of me following the same path actually kills me. This is the first time I\u2019m reaching out to anyone as I\u2019ve never had the courage to before. I\u2019m currently very confused, sad, and drunk. I\u2019m sorry if this makes no sense.

I have seen no substantial input.  I wanted to attend a related 'SMART' recovery meeting (kind of like AA but without the religious element) but was told I would need to wait or  the organisers to contact me.  Having waited a month with no contact, I went along today and realized that there was no need to have waited at all.  \n\nI was supposed to be referred to a medical team for assessment but until I went into the CGL offices today, no referral had been made!\n\nDon't these people realize how difficult it is to acknowledge the problem and ask for help?!

He doesn\u2019t drink during work, but he and his work buddies may pick up some beer and drink in the office after work sometimes (off clock).  First thing he does when he comes home is drink. Beer and fireball. \n\nOne moment he seems fine and the next he\u2019s drunk. Incoherent, personality changes , and passes out. He\u2019s rarely mean, never abusive, though there has been a time or two where he will get aggressive in his actions if we fight ( yelling in my face, slamming doors,) but not often. Other times I can\u2019t understand what he\u2019s saying, or he\u2019s talking about Jesus, or cries, and then passes out. I know he passes out a lot because he also works hard and gets up super early.\n\nSo he has told me in the past that his drinking is my problem and that he works hard, has a great relationship with his family, friends, house etc - so if I have a problem with it, it\u2019s my problem and he\u2019s a grown man.  \n\nIs it wrong for me to have an issue with it? I don\u2019t want to take away his fun, but it feels real lonely at times eating dinner by yourself and watching movies by yourself. One minute it seems like we are having a great conversation and the next, he\u2019s incoherent and I can\u2019t understand him. I would say this is 3-4 times a week.\n\nAny opinions?",

I told myself for a long time that I was just unlucky, that opiates are a nasty drug and can get their hooks in anyone. I ditched the rooms and the 12 steps within a year of treatment, telling myself that I wasn\u2019t a \u201ctrue alcoholic.\u201d In short, I never fixed what was truly ailing me.\n\nEver since my son was born two years ago, my drinking has escalated. As I type this, I\u2019ve finished the last quarter bottle of a pint of Bulleit rye, which I bought yesterday along with four airplane bottles of Jack Daniels. I drank everything except that last quarter pint last night whenever my wife wasn\u2019t looking, then passed out while attempting to play Fallout 76 with my brother. I woke up on the couch at 2 am. Regular night for me.\n\nI\u2019m 33 years old this month, and recently my blood pressure has started to rise. I\u2019m overweight, and I can\u2019t keep doing this to myself. I\u2019m writing this not for sympathy, but as the first step to recovery. I\u2019ve made a daily reminder in my phone to run/pray/talk at 5 pm. This is to remind me to either exercise, take calming breaths and read the Bible, or go to a meeting every night at the time when my demons seem to be the loudest.\n\nAny and all suggestions for how to move forward with this disease are most welcome.

She moved in with us after a nasty divorce with my FIL. She can't really afford to live on her own. Over the past year or so, we've noticed that she's been drinking more and more....and she hides it from us. At first, we just thought it was weird, but we would love to drink with her! But then, we realized she had a problem. She's gone through so much in the past several years and we believe that she's also severely depressed. We keep begging her to go see a therapist or go to an AA meeting, but she refuses.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA couple weeks ago, there was an incident that involved my 6 year old daughter. Long story short, everyone was fine, but she could have hurt both of them severely. The next day (when she was sober), she didn't remember any of it and my husband took her keys (so she couldn't go buy more liquor). However, we recently found out that she hid a spare key and has been still going out to get more liquor. She's been drunk for the past couple of days so we haven't really had a chance to talk to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe really need her to get right. But, since she refuses, I feel like our only choice is to kick her out. But, like I said, she can't afford to live on her own, we're basically putting her on the street. She really needs our help, but it's starting to affect our own family. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny and all advice would be greatly appreciated. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(P.S. This is tearing my husband up, so gentle approaches would be preferred)",

            "selftext": "Posting here because I'm sad and appreciate any advice or encouragement.\n\nI'm 19 and I live alone with my parents, my older brother moved out a few months ago. Yesterday around 11 pm I was in my room listening to music. I got down to go get a glass of water and I realized my parents were gone, then I noticed there were traces of blood all over the hallway - like, big traces that someone had unsuccessfully tried to get rid of, red marks on the floor and every kitchen towel stained. No notes or anything. Panic mode on, I sent my dad a text message asking him to call me or at least send a text. Once I got a response I cleaned up whatever blood I could and stayed awake in bed until I heard them come home.\n\nSo... yesterday, my mom fell down the stairs. She hit her forehead pretty badly and had to sew a few stitches but other than that she's fine. I haven't seen her face yet because she's been sleeping and I'm mostly hiding in my room.\n\nI couldn't help but cry last night because honestly, it was just a matter of time. It's not the first time she's fallen - I actually heard her fall yesterday, I know exactly what it sounds like since it happens at least a couple times a month. I just don't react to it anymore. Both of my parents will sometimes drink a bit much but my mom gets drunk more days than not. She's never been aggressive or anything like that but she's basically a zombie and you can't really keep much of a conversation with her (unless you consider her repeating herself 4-5 times a conversation). Fine, whatever - it's her life and if she wants to be a zombie, that's ultimately her decision. I've mostly gotten past the point where I feel embarrassed about her behavior. However, at this point, I'm genuinely concerned. It's not the last time she's going to fall down a flight of stairs and I'm scared she's going to hurt herself really badly at some point.\n\nI've never talked to her about this. My family doesn't really talk about \"difficult\" things, period. The only time I've ever opened up is when I left her a note telling her I was depressed and needed help (which I did get and am now fine, but she's said some pretty insensitive stuff as well so I still don't feel comfortable talking about those things). She's also a little defensive overall, not in an aggressive way but in the sense that she doesn't like admitting she's wrong or has flaws. Nonetheless, I feel like I really should bring this up somehow. I was thinking of leaving her a note the same way I did last time, just shortly explaining to her that I'm worried for her and want her to get help.\n\nFor years I didn't even want to admit that she was drinking too much, I just told myself she's \"tired\". No one, including my dad and brother, has ever commented on her behavior (in my presence) other than a friend saying she seems, well, tired. For those reasons, I still find it hard to accept the reality as it is and I'm terrified I'll be met with an \"oh, it's not alcohol, I don't drink too much, I just \\[insert excuse\\]\" and actually believe it. But at this point I don't think it's about my feelings anymore, it's about her safety.\n\n(Side note: English is not my first language, in case I messed up somewhere)",

            "selftext": "So yeah long story short ive been drinking pretty heavily for close to a year. I dont have to many problems or stress i just did it because i enjoyed it. Up until the last few months i was fine and then i hit a patch where i was getting sick. I got the shingles and went to the dr. Dr told me to stop drinking and get my body right. He said i was potentially immuno compromised because of excessive alcohol and smoking. He took my blood and did a bunch of panels (one of them bieng metabolic) and everything came back perfectly fine except for my vitamin d levels. I stopped drinking and smoking for a month (cold turkey) and felt great.\n\nUnfortunately i fell off the wagon and went on a 5 day binge where i was drinking a 6 pack every night. Now i noticed that i have this uncomfortable bloat everytime i eat something. There is no pain and my stool and urine look fine. I was wondering if some of you had experienced that after quitting or while drinking. I am a 27 year old male btw",

We have a call from pre-school an hour after pick up time, saying they weren't comfortable releasing the children as they thought she was drunk. \n\nSide note, the kids get picked up on a bike an trailer. \n\nSo, I high tail it home and, sure enough, she's drunk. Stumbling, semi coherent drunk. \n\nThe kids are taken away by my parents, I prepare a meal, hot tea and talk to her. Yes, she's been drinking gin, apparently her mum is not well etc. \n\nI think she has some personality issues, but hey honestly, who doesn't. Still, she's an ok kid, but she's fucked up. I explain this to her an she's gone the next morning (to stay with her boyfriend). \n\nToday, cleaning out her room o send on her remaining belongings, I find three empty vodka and one gin bottle in her wardrobe. So... Yes, pretty serious.\n\nMy first response is to send her a picture with a WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU sort of message. \n\nBut now, I've calmed down a bit and... Well, that isn't going to help her. In fact u will probably put her further into the corner, guilt shame, perhaps self harm or worse. \n\nSo, people who've dealt with alcoholism. What do I say to reach out to someone who clearly has a problem?",

            "selftext": "I\u2019ve been drowning my sorrows and loneliness in alcohol. I figured it was better than the other options. Well, last night after a couple months of sobriety I gave in. I was on my way to get a sack of nug and ran in to this chick I smoked meth with for the first time. We caught up, she\u2019s always been cool I never had an issue with her addiction. Sure, she\u2019s not who she really is when she\u2019s tweaking, but I still like her as a person. I end up getting her number to hang out after me and my brother go see Detective Pikachu. I really didn\u2019t have any plans to go see her. Well.... I ended up cracking. I snorted a few kpins, drank a fith of liquor, and ended up hitting her pipe twice. I barely felt anything, but I still feel dirty about it. Kpins and all. 2 months down the drain. All because I got lonely. On the bright side I met some cool stoners who blew down on a sev with me. I still just feel so depressed about the situation. I woke up and started guzzling whiskey just to forget about it. I was hoping it was just a meth dream that I get from time to time.... nope. All because I know this isn\u2019t alcohol related, but if I wasn\u2019t drunk I wouldn\u2019t have thought of snorting k pins or hitting the pipe a couple times.\nEdit: i barely felt the meth do to the kpins and booze.",

            "selftext": "Hello all, \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr at the bottom..\n\n  \nIt's my first time posting to this subreddit and my first time looking externally for help with my mother's condition.  Apologies in advance if i somehow broke a rule. I'll provide a little bit of background info.  My mom has had a handful of traumatic events occur throughout her life and struggles with depression and anxiety.  \n\nTo start, she was dyslexic growing up and as a result was bullied/treated very poorly in her school system.  I think this led to low self esteem and a general lack of confidence.  In high school she lost 2-4 good friends (i forget the exact number) in a drunk driving accident.  In the last decade she's lost her father; she actually found him in his house after he had been dead for two weeks.  A few years later, her younger sister fell down her apartment stairs and died.  Foul play was suspected but the city police department never took it further (i guess this is irrelevant anyways).  My mom is extremely stubborn and would rather stomach her emotion and pain than admit she needs grief counseling or help in general.  \n\nThe alcoholism: I come from a family of big drinkers.  Family parties are always stocked with more than enough alcohol and most adults have at least, i don't know, 4 drinks and max out at maybe 10?  I believe by definition this is considered binge drinking.  Growing up my mom would have a few glasses of wine a night without fail.  As her depression or overall mood deteriorates she drinks more.  She never gets black out drunk or passes out, she'll start slurring her words and seem somewhat euphoric.    \n\n\nThe main issues are: Her depression fluctuates: she'll be in a better mood for longer periods of time(months, occasionally years), she'll drink *less,* but still end up having a drink or two a night (this puts my family at *somewhat* of an ease).  She's on anti depressants/anxieties and her tolerance is very low (she can't handle her alcohol like she used to).  She's extremely stubborn and due to the culture she was surrounded by, we can't seem to convince her she has a problem.  She avoids opening up or talking about her problems AT ALL COSTS.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've sat down and talked to her multiple times about it.  I've explained you really *shouldn't* antidepressants with alcohol.   \n Before she actually listens to what we are saying, she usually gives an excuse along the lines of: you don't know how hard i've had it.  she'll go on to talk about how difficult losing her sister and her dad etc was.  This is where we explain she needs grief counseling and this is a common issue so many people struggle with.  My younger sister and I usually end up balling our eyes out because we can tell she's hurting so bad.  If things get really emotional, she'll usually end up coming around and comforting us by explaining she'll work on it.  However when we bring it up in the subsequent days she doesn't want to talk about it and explains she's working on it and to not bother her (she's extremely sensitive).  It usually lasts a few days then goes back to normal.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost recently my sister and I cried in front of her for what felt like 30 minutes, we couldn't control ourselves.  She said she'd quit drinking for two weeks to start (my sisters, my dad, and I debated on the period of time for a while (not infront of her)).  The next day, against her will, we pulled all the alcohol out of the cabinets and fridge and hid them. She thought we were being dramatic and blowing the situation out of proportion.  Anyways,  She didn't drink for the majority of the time and ended up having a glass of wine at a family gathering as everyone else was drinking and not aware of what was going on.  She was in a much better mood and has seemed to have been doing much better in general (despite drinking regularly but in lower quantities) since all of this happened, at most 6 months ago.\n\n  \nPlot twist: we found an empty handle of vodka hidden in our screened porch where she goes to smoke cigarettes (pack a day).  We're assuming she had been drinking at night after we went to bed (for the two weeks she was supposed to be on the wagon) or she's been slowly pulling out of it, over the course of the past few months as to not alarm us.  Its hard for me to believe she drank and hid it from us as its very obvious when she's had a drink or two (due to her medication).  I told myself and my sisters if she starts to hide it that's when its a very real and alarming problem and we have to kick it into high gear.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHOW DO WE CONVINCE AN EXTREMELY STUBBORN AND SENSITIVE-TOPIC AVOIDING PERSON THEY NEED HELP.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: depressed mom has been an alcoholic for a long time, majority of the time functioning, other times getting bad but not TERRIBLE.  sometimes she acknowledges she needs help, but never consistently follows through in getting help.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nit feels like we've tried everything. i know other people have been here and i know we're not alone in struggling with this.  any and all advice would be greatly appreciated.  we're looking into family counseling currently but i know its going to be impossible to get her there.  she's extremely self conscious, lacks confidence, and refuses to open up.",

On weekends i like to buy liqour seeing as i dont have anything to do. Now i have tried to quit but its really hard. Its a stress relief for me. And if i dont have more i keep thinking about it. I dont get shakey or any withdrawals. If i do get withdrawals i just munch on junk food and it goes away. Now i know this doesnt sound like an alcoholic but ive had alcohol every day now pretty much. I even have a couple days off this week so i went and bought me a nice bourbon to enjoy until i get back to work. My wife calls me an alcoholic and it really puts me down and makes me feel guilty for it. I just need advice on if i should quit or if im doing anything wrong. Or any advice really.",

            "selftext": "So, I just turned 31 last month. I'm not exactly an alcoholic but I like to drink now and then. I don't crave alcohol tho. \n\nBackstory is, October last year, on a Friday after getting outta work I decided to grab some drinks with a friend. Everything was normal, drinking only beer. So we went to another bar and I drank some hard licor (moonshine). Next thing I know is all hell broke lose. I don't remember much, just some girls waking me up on a sideway, they were calling an ambulance. I tried to stood up and said \"Nah there's no need\", and after that I just remember waking up in the hospital.\n\n2 broken ribs, swollen face, a bit of my ear ripped off. I never went through something like that. Hell, I didn't even had a street fight in 15 years.\n\nApparently I picked up a fight with 4 or 5 homeless / drug users. \n\nBut eventually I got better. So after 2 months I decided to go out with some friends, and it was good. I woke up in my bed, in one piece, nothing was stolen. So I text a friend to see if I did something wrong. I did. Suddenly I tried to pick a fight with some bad hombres. A friend tackled me and they called an Uber to get me out. \n\nAnd it happened a third time at a BBC, same history, but this time I was mad at my own friends. \n\nThis has been a disgrace. I don't understand. I am not a violent person, I'm always extremely calm and kind of stoic.  I never picked up fights, never dissed anyone and all of a sudden this starts to happen.\n\nMaybe it's some kind of PTSD? \n\nI noticed that this only happens if I mix drinks. \n\nIt's like everything is normal and then boom, something in my brain turns off. Maybe suicidal tendencies? \n\nI know I may sound like a scumbag, but if someone went through something like this, please share.\n\nI don't know what to do. Not drinking seems the obviously answer. But I would like to be able to drink some and not get killed. Like overcoming a fear.\n\nThanks for reading.",

What is it going to take for my mother to quit?? \n\nIm 20 myself for reference. My mother (49) use to be a heavy drinker before she had me, she stopped drinking but I'm the last two years (roughly) she's picked it back up. It's gone so far to the point where she: \nLost her licence\nLost her job\nLost most of her friends\nHas virtually no money\nBegan do drink all day, almost every day \n\nAbout a month ago she revealed her addiction to her parents and they came to pick her up and have her stay with them aboput an hour from where we live. Unfortunately my father works interstate and isn't often home. Her drinking has strained their relationship badly and my dad is becoming tired of it (not to mention he grew up with an alcoholic father) and isn't very sympathetic about it. So in all honesty the only support he really provides is that he pays for the bills and keeps a good over our head thank God. \n\nWhile my moyher was staying with her parents, she had a seizure due to severe withdrawals (went from roughly 3/4 a bottle of vodka a day to nothing). She survived the seizures with no damage done luckily. I really thoughy that would be a wake-up call for her. She remained sober for the month or so she stayed with her parents. \n\n A few days ago, her parents dropped her back off home (where I live) due to my grandmother (her mother for clarity) is going into surgery, so unfortunately I think she has to stay here with me for the time being. \n\nAfter she was dropped off, I had a long discussion with her about how I can't handle her slipping back into her old habits and that she needs to get a routine into her life again. All was well and good for 3 days until she binged out while I was at work and she got badly drunk. She's been given valium to help with withdrawals, and sleeping tablets, but unfortunately she seems to be also abusing them, taking maximum doses and mixing it with alcohol. \n\nShe tells me how embarrassed she is and ashamed, and how much she wants to stop. But she still continues to drink. I can talk until I collapse about how it's destroying her life and her body but she just doesn't seem to listen to me or care enough. At this point I just want to run away and move out, but I know that would be cowardly. It's selfish but I find it so hard to deal with this while trying to build up my own life. I have a girlfriend who is incredibly supportive but at the end of the day I dread coming home because i dont know what I'll face behind that door. \n\nI'm sorry this is such a rant but I'm just lost for what to do. Any advice or input is greatly appreciated. Thank you so much for listening.",

Normal drinkers around me looked on in despair; they couldn\u2019t figure me out at all\u2026 and they shouldn't be expected to; their minds work completely differently to mine with respect to alcohol.\n\nThe things that hold us in denial are; highly strengthened cravings, the absence of drink-aversion triggers, the changes in mood and distress that are the result of alcohol tolerance, falsely distorted memory favoring alcohol, and the firm knowledge that drinking will make us feel better. Added to this is the change in our social patterns; we only willingly attend social functions where there will be alcohol, so the only \u201cfun\u201d we know in our lives is linked to drinking.\n\nUnder these conditions I had no desire at all to stop drinking.

It was the *only* thing that made me feel better and it was the *only* source of fun I knew.\n\nPeople observing or trying to help us are completely baffled by our behaviour. \u201cWhy don\u2019t they see all the harm that their drinking is doing?\u201d They think we are being weak, stubborn or willfully ignorant. They see all the problems that our drinking is causing; to ourselves, to our families, at work, or with the law, and the solution is obvious to them\u2026 drink less! But we can\u2019t.\n\nDrinking less is not an option for us because it cannot be done. The combination of; a reward system in a runaway condition, changes in the brain due to alcohol tolerance, and the absolute knowledge that \u201cdrinking is good\u201d make it impossible for us to either drink less, or to exercise effective control over our drinking. This is an absolute truth. Not only is our free will compromised, but our mind actively works against us, sabotaging any attempt to reduce what we drink or stop for a spell. Once our brains have adapted to tolerate alcohol then we already lack the means to control how we drink: no-one has ever managed to overcome this. No alcoholic has ever subsequently become a moderate drinker. \n\nDrinking moderately was not an option for me, but I clung on desperately to the idea that I could somehow achieve it. Drinking was the only thing that made living worthwhile and I couldn\u2019t imagine life without it. So I kept on trying to control my drinking \u2026 and I kept failing to do so.\n\nDenial eventually broke down for me in the face of indisputable evidence that my continued drinking was a bad idea. It wasn\u2019t a lightbulb moment; it was more of a gradual grinding down until the conclusion became inevitable. It\u2019s not what I wanted to believe, but in the end the conclusion was inescapable\u2026 my drinking had to change, because try as I might I could not manage one simple thing\u2026 to drink sensibly. I was all out of ideas. I\u2019d tried everything but I still drank more and I drank more often than I wanted to, and far, far more than was sensible even by my own \u201cheavy drinker\u201d standards. But I was left in complete limbo. I couldn\u2019t control my drinking, but the idea that I should stop forever was inconceivable\u2026 I couldn\u2019t even go three days, so how would I stop forever, and why would I even want to try?... not drinking meant no more fun!\n\n\u201cWhy would I?\u201d eventfully answered itself. There came a time when I couldn\u2019t stop drinking, but I couldn\u2019t carry on either; things were really bad and continued drinking meant things were going to continue to get worse and worse. As I looked into my own future I only saw hopelessness and despair. As far as I could see I was going to end up dying somewhere alone and miserable. It had change. That was all: it had to change. I didn\u2019t really even know what \u201cit\u201d was; everything in my life was going wrong, but drinking was definitely a significant part of it\u2026 and it had to change.\n\nDenial was broken. It left me desperate and directionless, but that desperation was the key motivator that allowed me to change what had previously been unchangeable. Desperation gave me levels of courage, determination and strength that were previously unattainable. Desperation is what we get when we realise that change isn\u2019t just desirable, it is vital. For many this means reaching the \u201crock-bottom\u201d that\u2019s often mentioned in recovery circles. But however it is found it is the \u201cgift of desperation\u201d that allows us to succeed when we have previously failed. Hitting rock-bottom isn\u2019t essential to recovery, but it is very often what gives us sufficient strength to overcome those compelling mental processes that drive our addiction. Those mental processes evolved over hundreds of millions of years with the express purpose of directing our behaviour; that is why they exist. They evolved to make us behave in certain ways *despite* what we think is right in the moment, and they are deliberately not easily set-aside because their intent is to help us survive\u2026 which is the ultimate goal of life. Desperation gives us the strength to overcome the internal screaming demand that we drink and it does so by giving us the strength to reply to the call, not with \u201cI don\u2019t want to\u201d, but with \u201cI must not\u201d.\n\nI was desperate, but I was also clue-less. All I knew about my drinking was that I couldn\u2019t stop it, and that is finally what drove me to find help. I began to acknowledge the awful idea that I might be an alcoholic, but I didn\u2019t know what to do about it; I was completely out of ideas. Nothing I had tried had worked so I had to somehow find people who did know what to do. I walked into an AA meeting but in reality, at this point, almost any help would have worked. The *essential* element in recovery is not the recovery method followed, but the need to change. Once we realise that change is necessary then any recovery method will help us, but until then nothing is sufficiently persuasive to overcome hundreds of millions of years of evolution. But the will to change must be powerful, it has to be strong enough to overcome what the brain thinks is important for us to do to survive, and good intentions insufficient. The need to stop drinking needs to be the match of the imperative to drink\u2026 and that comes from our brain\u2019s belief that this is a matter of survival. So our need to stop must be of equal measure\u2026 and over time it becomes precisely that. There comes a point where our downward trajectory is so committed that if we continue we will die. Alcoholics die prematurely; from organ failure, traumatic accident, or suicide. If we carry on drinking we will die, so if we are to survive then we must stop drinking. When we fully believe this then we have something that is the equal of our condition. Both courses of action are driven by the need to survive\u2026 they are equal\u2026 so the fight is now on level ground. It is a brutal fight of attrition, but at least now the odds are more evenly balanced.",

            "selftext": "I went out for drinks with co-workers on Friday after work with the intention of just having three beers max. Long story short, I ended up having way more than three beers, blacked out, and was informed the next day that I made an ass of myself at the bar. I spent Saturday and today feeling anxious and depressed and I\u2019ve decided that I\u2019m done doing this to myself. Yesterday after a long conversation with my boyfriend, I finally admitted to him and myself that I have a problem with alcohol and I\u2019ve made the decision to stop drinking. \n\nOver the years, I cannot count how many times I\u2019ve started out the night with the intention of just having a couple drinks and then ended up getting completely hammered. I have woken up so many times feeling ashamed and embarrassed about my behavior the night before and there have been several times where I\u2019ve woken up not even remembering what all I did the night before. I have questioned if I might have a problem with alcohol but I\u2019ve always found some kind of excuse to validate my habits. I rarely drink so it was hard for me to think of myself as an alcoholic and it was so easy to say \u201cwell I had a light dinner so that\u2019s probably why I got so drunk\u201d or \u201cI hardly ever drink so my tolerance just got low.\u201d In reality, I just struggle with drinking in moderation and I often don\u2019t know when I\u2019ve reached my limit until it\u2019s too late. Nothing terrible happened on Friday but I decided that was the last straw for me. \n\nI am proud of myself for finally admitting that I have a problem and I\u2019m happy that I\u2019ve made the decision to stop drinking. I never have feel shitty because of alcohol ever again and knowing that I can take control of this is empowering. However I also feel really overwhelmed! I\u2019m finally coming to terms with the fact that I have a problem after about 5 years of denial and it\u2019s hard for me to put my feelings about that into words. I know this will change the dynamics of a lot of social situations and stuff. For example, I\u2019m going to Las Vegas with friends later this week and in a couple months I\u2019m having a going away party that everyone is expecting to get hammered at. Right now I\u2019m on a medication I\u2019m not supposed to drink alcohol while taking so that\u2019s a nice little reason to give everyone for why I won\u2019t be drinking but eventually I will want to tell some of my friends the real reason and I don\u2019t even know how to do that. \n\nLuckily I have a supportive boyfriend and family. Boyfriend\u2019s dad is a recovering alcoholic so he has an understanding of alcoholism and my dad and step-mom are recovering alcoholics. My dad suggested AA and I will probably look into that. \n\nI guess I don\u2019t really know my reasoning for posting all of this. Just feels nice to get it off my chest and put my intentions out into the world.",

            "selftext": "I (23 F) have been dating my boyfriend (36M) for over a year and at first his drinking was up to 15 beers a day, beginning in the morning and ending at bed time.  I told him at that time that if he continued to get trashed and drink so heavily, it wasn\u2019t going to work out for me.  When he saw that I was serious after a few times of him testing me, he cut back considerably.  Promised not to get drunk and had only been having 2 beers at night to relax, enjoy himself, etc.  and some when we\u2019d go out to lunch and over special events like that.  After a pretty big fight we had, one night, I found him passed out in his truck, drunk at his parents house in their driveway.  (They know about his problem but also know there\u2019s nothing they can do about it as he\u2019s a grown man).  He lied to me for 3 days and claimed to have been just tired that night when I found him, even though he walked out of line, but then admitted later once I found a beer in his truck from the night in question, that he had been in fact \u201cstrongly buzzed\u201d because of our fight earlier that one evening.  \nWe moved forward from this, after a long drawn out conversation which he professed his love for me, his having never felt this way about anyone before, him knowing that I\u2019m the one for him, not wanting to be with anyone else, saying he\u2019d be devastated if we broke up, etc.  but I told him that if it happens again that  I would seriously be done, for good.  At that time he said he will do his best to not let it happen again, but is a self admitted addict, so there was never full confidence.  But he said if it does happen again, I can go and he will understand.  \nA couple nights ago, I found a beer he had been hiding from me, and he admitted on the spot that he was hiding it.  His excuse was that he has cut back considerably, which is true, and that he wasn\u2019t getting drunk and that he is trying his hardest.  Regardless, on the spot, I packed my bag and left the home we share together upon hearing this.  As I was leaving, he cracked open the beer he had been hiding and closed the door behind me.  I\u2019ve been gone since then and we have had no contact.  \n\nI myself am devastated, this is the man I love with my whole being.  He is great, funny, loving, caring, and exactly what I want in a man.  Minus the alcohol, obviously.  He\u2019s the first man I\u2019ve ever truly been myself around and know that he loves me for everything that I am.  He\u2019s opened my life to so many new and amazing things and people.  He\u2019s done a lot for me in our relationship, but this one thing he doesn\u2019t seem to be able to budge on.  Which is why this is truly the hardest thing I feel I\u2019ve ever been faced with.  We do everything together, and I\u2019ve always thought we would be able to move past his problem and build a life together.  I\u2019m beginning to think he is never going to change.  I\u2019ve suggested that he cut alcohol out of his life completely, and go to professional counseling to him many times before but he is unwilling. I could be wrong, but I personally feel like he is afraid to live without alcohol in his life to some extent.  He promised to go get help last time we had a break up and i was reluctant about getting back together, but the plans seemed to fall through and he insisted that he didn\u2019t need counseling.  I don\u2019t drink at all and I encourage him not to, and get upset at times when he goes to buy it, so in this situation I do not feel that I am an enabler in anyway.  I\u2019m so conflicted, because he has come a long way by cutting back on his drinking so greatly,  and making the true effort not to get drunk, I know he doesn\u2019t hide his drinking super often, but the fact that he does at all really breaks my trust.  I feel like I can\u2019t be away from him a lot of the time, in fear of what\u2019s gonna happen. And for this he calls me crazy even though he knows what he has done.\n\nAny opinions, thoughts and support would really help me at this time.",

During this 18 years of being intoxicated every fucking day he lost his family due to divorce, his father (September 2017) beloved mother-in-law and father-in-law.  \n\n\nI've always believed that any addiction is purely psychological (except for the physical part which is curable) and never got an answer why he started to drink.   \n\n\nFew days ago he started to feel bad. His aptetite got lower (and believe me, dude's a vaccum when it comes to bbq and fatty foods) and he became to feel very bad. He is now in a hospital since monday. Due to highly developed cirrhosis his kidneys have failed. Also, he can't piss (so he has a Foley catether attached). His diuresis is low (due to the fact that he refuses to drink for most of the time) and his piss bag is filled with blood. He barely stands and tends to cry sometimes (first time I've seen my father crying when he thought I wasn't looking at his face).  \n\n\nBut after all that, he acts like nothing has happened when he sees me, like: HOW YA DOIN', WHAT'S UP LITTLE FELLA, WE GETTIN SOME PIZZA WHEN I GET OUT OF HERE.  \n\n\nAnd you know what? Even though I have medical knowledge and I know how this is going to end, I still do have this fucking hope that his liver will go into some magic backup mode.",

I realized I was wrong for doing it but I don\u2019t remember much except that I came back and fell asleep.\n\nI don\u2019t know how he\u2019s forgiven me.

I\u2019ve read a little from alanon and I know a little about \u201cdetaching from love\u201d.\n\nHowever even during the first month my wife has been completely detached - barely saying hi, no hugs, no kisses - basically no real affection.  We\u2019re essentially roommates.\n\nI\u2019ve been going to meetings, volunteer at them, work every day, trying to do errands around the house when I can - and going over the top with effort sometimes in the hopes that it would spark some kind of affection.   When I go over the top, it bugs her -saying she knows I\u2019m trying to get something (not even sex really...an unprompted kiss would be great).  The most I usually get is a \u201cthanks\u201d.\n\nThe most kind of time we spend together now is occasionally watching a tv show or two after putting the kids to bed.  In this, she\u2019ll usually put her feet on my lap, or occasionally her head on my leg.  Both typically means I try and give her a massage.  This she feels is plenty of close time - for her - she has other hobbies she wants to do.\n\nWe\u2019ve been married coming up on 11 years mostly great, and have two kids.  I\u2019ve been battling recovery for about a year, because I\u2019ve been a real alcoholic for the last 2.\n\nWhenever I try to talk about finding a way to bring some connection back, she always says she thinks it\u2019ll \u201cjust take time\u201d.  Makes sense to a point - it\u2019s fucking early!   But time doing what?  Nothing?\n\nHow is X amount of time only occasionally watching a tv show together ever going to lead to closeness?  Is she just punishing me or waiting for me to fail again?\n\nWhat have you done to try to bring something back - has it been this cold?  If so, how do you try to keep the relationship even alive?  Sorry to ramble \ud83d\ude2c\n\nThanks",

My husband is a great father, and our kids are doing great. He does and will do anything for them. The thing is I married very young and shortly after we were separated quickly because of his work. He had many relationships during our marriage. One night stands and some that lasted years. I guess he is an addict in his own thing. He even had babies with another woman during our marrieds. I forgave as he always told me he made mistakes because of our life apart from me and how he was lonely, but he never loved anyone other than me. We have been living together in the same house now for a few years like normal, but he is not faithful. I think sometimes I would feel better if I just let go of him, but at the same time, I am so afraid that I will not manage alone. Has anyone been in this mess?",

            "selftext": "Hi all,  i have been dealing with a toxic family dynamic for some time now. Recently my mother and brother have said things that aren\u2019t true about me, after a recent relapse I have been having a hard time getting back on my feet from. After everything was said I have decided to not be around them for a while. This is not the first time I have been thrown under the bus from the drama, my brother is also a addict/alcoholic. But for my own mental health I can\u2019t be around the drama they continue to create. At Christmas my brother blacked out and threatened my SO mother, telling his whole family I cheated on him which I didn\u2019t. I was sober at this time and again was the one in the wrong and had to explain myself on what happened. My brother gave me a black eye and I had a small scar when he threw his glass at me, which luckily it didn\u2019t cause any further damage but yet I was in the wrong. Long story short. I won\u2019t be attending Mother\u2019s Day brunch, and advised my family of this a week or two ago. But instead of being supportive i feel like I\u2019m being gaslighted for setting boundaries to not be around them when they cause so much drama for no reason, because they feed on drama. I know I\u2019m not perfect but I was totally honest about relapse which is a really good place to start but now I feel like I\u2019m constantly having to defend myself about my boundaries. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m wrong for finally drawing a line that I\u2019m not going to put up with this anymore. I think after years of being blamed for anything that happens around my mom or brother it\u2019s a good place to start to say enough is enough of being the scapegoat in the family. I have done a lot of work on myself and was advised my sponsor to stay away from them. I really want advice because I feel bad for doing this or my family is making me feel like I\u2019m in the wrong? I don\u2019t know what to do besides avoid the drama",

            "selftext": " \n\n## I  apologize in advance for the wall of text. Things are going down today  and I'm probably going to use this post to vent a little. there is a  TL;DR at the bottom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy  wife and I have been with each other for 16 years. We met in 2004 when  we were both freshman in high school. I cannot describe how unbelievable  in love I am with this woman. I know we will spend the rest of our  lives together. We started living together shortly after graduating high  school at her house. This is when I got to know \"P\" (the father in law)  I also became very close to the rest of her family.  her mom we will  call \"M\" and two younger sisters.\n\nLong  story short both of my wife's parents were addicts. M was an alcoholic  and used to be hook on pain pills and P could not function without  alcohol in his system for as long as I knew him. At first we barley  noticed how bad it was because they were wealthy and owned a business  and for the most part they were functional. All that stability came  crashing down one day when we found out that P was avoiding the IRS and  he owed an insane amount of money. after a few years of screening calls  and ignoring summons. the IRS came and took everything from P. He lost  his business, The cars, he sold all his valuables, and eventually he had  to sell the house.  You can imagine how bad his drinking got after  that.\n\nBy the time the house was sold  both the younger sisters had moved out with their long term boyfriends.  My wife and I decided to stay and live with them in the new rental home.  We knew that they were dig themselves into deeper trouble without sober  minds around. also we thought we would save more money living with them  for free.  M didn't have a job but P was a dentist and was making  enough to pay the rent at the new home.\n\nFor  4 years I watched this man spiral out of control. every single night he  was so drunk he would scream and break things until the middle of the  night. My wife and I had had basically two jobs; our normal jobs and  then when we got home we have to mitigate the damage that P would cause.  Every single night P would just shout nonsense at the top of his lungs.  The neighbors hated us. they heard the crashing and screaming every  night and they went out of their way to passive aggressively get back at  us. they would call H.O.A. for the dumbest things and we would get  fined. police were called a few time and every time we would see them  outside we  would just get the nastiest looks.\n\nP  ended up getting fired from two separate jobs and our income started  lacking. So my wife and I started helping out with bills and groceries  but eventually we got evicted from that home. my wife and I had 10k  saved up and ended up spending 8k  on a new home to rent and we  continued to live with them. In this new home is when things got real  bad. that year P totaled TWO cars  while drunk. he was arrested and we  had to bail him out. now I'm driving him to work and babysitting him  when he gets home and working full time. Hes going to work drunk and  getting in trouble.  he gets fired from another job. My fiance and I are  literally fighting all the time because we cant sleep and she drives 45  mins to work in the morning after hearing her dad scream and break shit  all night. Some nights he would be screaming so late into the night  that i... regrettably lost my temper and I spent the entire night  slapping his face every time his opened his mouth. I did it because my  wife had just worked a double shift and was exhausted and had a another  double shift the next day. I would be damned if she crashed on her way  to her job because he kept her up all night.\n\nMy  wife and I reached our breaking point and we moved out and left them to  their own devices. Her sisters, who wanted nothing to do with their  parents, kept telling us its not our problem and to just ignore them. We  listened we turned our backs on them for about a year but then it  caught up with us. One day about year since we moved out i get a phone  call from M. She informs me that she had a heart attack and is in the  hospital and P had been missing for almost 24 hours. She called me  because her 3 daughters screened her calls and I was the only one she  knew would answer.  It was then that I realized that these people will  literally die without us there. When my wife heard the news she went  into a crying fit for almost the whole day. I went to the hospital and I  told them. I would take the mom in with me because shes manageable. she  cant walk well or drive at all so she will be forced to sober up with  us at the cost of our privacy and independence. My wife's sisters  thought that was a bad idea but i had lost a lot of respect for them by  that point because of how they just ignored the problem for so long.\n\nSo  now its present day and its been a year since M moved in with us and P  went to live at his sisters house. things are finally going great and we  are back on our feet. We have been taking care of M without issue and  my wife and I literally a day ago were talking about how happy we were  and last night we got a call from P's sister.  She was coming to drop P  off at our house with all his stuff because she cant handle him anymore.   I told her that I didn't want P there but she said it would be only  for a few nights because shes so stressed out. I agreed for 2 nights.  now she is telling me she doesn't want him back at all and basically  abandoned P on my doorstep.\n\nwould I be wrong to grab all his things and  just leave him on the sidewalk at his moms house? I cannot live with  this man any longer and I don't have the resources or help to get him  the help he needs. He cant drive or work or be trusted. his first night  here with me he raided my fridge for beer but i preemptively dumped all  my liquor. My wife cried today harder than ive see her cry in a long  time. It dives me insane to see her hurt so much and I don't know what to  do. The sisters outright refuse to even talk to him and I am out of  options.\n\nAlso FYI...P was just in a  government rehab facility for 4 months and got sober and on his first  day out got drunk and high. so we cant afford to send him to another  place unless its free.\n\nany advice would be appreciated also I dunno what to do. we live in Florida.\n\nTL;DR  Alcoholic father in law was dropped on my doorstep by another family  member that didn't want to deal with him and my wife and I are already  taking care of her alcoholic and disabled mother. We cant take him in  and I am planning on packing up all his stuff and leaving him on the  side of the road by his moms house.",

Cold sweats, vivid dreams, no appetite etc. This continued to the point were I couldn't take it anymore so drank last night to make me feel better. Now while I didn't get waisted or anything I woke up this morning feeling completely detached from reality. And empty and depressed, almost as if I won't ever get better. More over my stomach is in alot of pain. I'm wondering if I'll be fine mentally? Should I go to a doctor? I'm so focused on becoming sober now and thank you in advance",

            "selftext": "I was at a little fire at my lifelong buddy's mom's house. She doesn't drink at all and hard supports my sobriety. My bud drinks lightly and doesn't get drunk when he does. He always asks me if it's okay everytime even though he knows it's cool. And the same goes for anyone else who wants to responsibly drink around me. Let's face it. I will see alcohol everywhere for the rest of my life. I'm not scared of the bottle. I'm scared of what's inside of me that draws me to the bottle. My psuedo older sister and my buddy's girlfriend were drinking somewhat heavy. No big deal. I like them both alot and have no problem being around them. Both have reached out to me for some light guidance with handling alcoholism but neither have hit the bottom hard enough to wake up. By the time my psuedo sister left I couldn't understand a word she was saying. She was fine ultimately though. My buddy's gf was not. She was the only one left drinking and was pissy because no one wanted to continue hanging out. So then in spite she decided to go to the bar even though she could hardly walk let alone  hold on to her smokes and purse. But she was fucking going.\n\nThen something happened. I know this person. I know someone who acts just like this when they need more of the sweet chaos of a great drunk that they won't let end. I'm that person in every way. She may be a girl and I a guy. We have different upbringings and morals. Yet somehow we are the same.\n\nI realized two things:\n\n1)  I never have to go back there. Back to being drunk and consumed by myself. I have complete control and I never have to feel the fear, anxiety, and pain ever again. This thought makes me feel safe in a way I haven't in a long time\n\n2) Alcoholics need to look to recovering alcoholics. You need to turn inward towards these people. Seriously just go to AA when you have rolled on your back to finally give up. We carry a specific burden that only others who suffer from alcoholism can understand and mend and those rooms will help. I saw myself in my friend. It made me sad to see her go through it and it hurts to be reminded of myself in that state. But I'll be there to lend an ear or some words just like I know any of the old timers in my group would for me.",

            "selftext": "Hello, some background info: I\u2019m 17 and my mom is an alcoholic. She was sober for 8 years and then started drinking again a year ago and had been on and off ever since.\n\nWhen I was younger I didn\u2019t fully understand what alcoholism could do to someone, I didn\u2019t comprehend what was happening to my mom. When she got sober I knew it was a good thing and her being healthy made up for the time she was gone after she left my dad and went to rehab on the whole other side of the country. \n\nLast May she started drinking again. The way I found out was by far the worst. She was picking me up from school one day and as I went to throw my backpack into the back of her car I saw empty nip bottles and knew that something was going on. I was the first of my siblings to find out and on that ride back to my house I just sat in silence. This was the beginning of the decline of our relationship. I ended up telling my dad a few weeks later after my mom showed up to a family even clearly intoxicated and then I knew everything was happening again.  This is when the trust issues began, she was asking me for money...my money that I worked for. Of course I gave it to her, I didn\u2019t know what else to do. She wasn\u2019t the person I had known anymore. \n\nFlash forward a month, she takes me and my brother on a small weekend vacation. She was drunk the whole time, luckily I could drive myself and it wasn\u2019t a huge issue but she Thought she could hide it and she couldn\u2019t. I\u2019ll never forget this trip, I was anxious the whole time and she would be gone for hours at a time, drinking, and then come back just to go to sleep. After this trip I realized I had to do something so I talked to my dad and we decided that writing a letter would be the best option. So that\u2019s what I did, I wrote a letter to my mom expressing my concerns and that I was worried constantly about her and what she was doing, keep in mind I was the only one of my siblings that was really noticing what was going on bc I spent the most time w her. Giving her the letter was very difficult but I did it. She then wrote me one back admitting to drinking and saying she was sorry.\n\nI haven\u2019t been able to look at her the same and I don\u2019t know what to do. I love her so much but still when I say \u201cI love you\u201d it almost feels empty. I never see her anymore and I\u2019m not sure what I can do to improve the relationship with her. It bothers me that I can\u2019t see her without wondering what\u2019s happening. If anyone has suggestions please lmk. Sorry for the book, thanks for the read.",

            "selftext": "This is my third run at sobriety, my first lasted a month, second one 17 months. I know this one will stick but now I suffer from anxiety (sometimes severe). I think it's a combination of always having anxiety and noises I don't have my original coping mechanism (alcohol) and also due to the fact that now I worry about the harm I inflicted on myself from the decade of heavy drinking.\n\nI started drinking at age 14, a few beers here or there, but before I was 14 I was drinking nearly every night. I drank all through high school, and really hit the booze hard when I was 18. I suffered a lot of trauma at that time, some partly brought on by my drinking I'd say.  Anyways, I was drinking 5 nights a week I'd say, 10 or 12 beers a night, and when I'd party I'd drink some liquor as well.  I'd go on binders, drink alone, drink with people, I was angry, sad, suicidal (I think) however now looking back it may have been a front, a cry for help if you will. I drank, I took pills, did whatever drugs were put in front of me. I would drink 30 packs, fifths, I'd sleep maybe two hours after partying all night and wake up and start drinking as soon as my ass left the bed. I was court ordered to a mental health facility for a rather se ere self inflicted wound. And I repeated this behavior until I had my daughter at age 24. \n\nI slowed down exponentially and quit for 17 months. When i relapsed or fell off the wagon or started drinking again or whatever was around the holidays. It was nothing like before, i had/have a child that I love with my whole fiber, this time i drank in moderation, only allowing myself 3 drinks when I would drink. I thought I was cured. When i started noticing myself dreading the third drink because i knew it was my last i realized i wasn't well and that i needed to stop for good, AND HERE I AM TODAY.\n\nI know I would probably be dead by now if I continued drinking the way I did and I'm grateful for every single sover day I have but sometimes the anxiety and the guilt gets so heavy. The guilt I have from the pain and worry I put my loved ones through. I love my wife so incredibly much, she is a wonderful woman and she helped me beat my dependence. She is a wonderful mother and we have a great life together but sometimes the darkness comes over me, it's not a craving to drink although sometimes I find it sad I cant drink moderately the way others can, it's just a dark despairing feeling, that the addiction already beat me somehow. Its extremely tough to explain. Maybe it's just trauma I created for myself from all of those years.\n\nAnyways, I'm not really sure if anyone will read this or why I even typed it out. I am just laying here in bed and cant fall asleep and wanted to share my experience, maybe some good will come from it, maybe i will feel better, maybe someone else will benefit from reading it. Who knows,but if you have made it this far, good luck and goodnight. May you find peace and keep it.",

            "selftext": "This is really hard for me to post, but I need to reach out. My girlfriend and I have been dating for roughly 3 months and some change and she's very sweet and I wouldn't want to be with anyone else, but she drinks. A lot. \nWe play League of Legends most nights (we live close but not together and not close enough to be together every night, it's closer to 3 days a week that she will come and stay over), and she's drunk almost every night. Sometimes to the point where she doesn't remember details from previous nights. She will often drink 100 proof vodka straight from the bottle and can go through a full bottle of it in a few days.\nI want to help her but she will often deny that it's an issue, and most of her friends don't stop/contribute to this behavior. It makes it difficult to tackle because many of them she has known longer than me, and I don't want to try to help her in a way that undermines her as a person or my respect for her, or in a way that could put our relationship in danger.\nShe isn't a mean or angry drunk, but her family has a history of alcoholism, and one of her grandparents also had mouth cancer related to his alcoholism. I worry a lot about what could happen if something doesn't happen to stop this. Please, any advice would help a lot.",

            "selftext": "In short, my dad is a heavy drinker, he is also a narcissist and abusive. My mom took us (the kids) away when I was 14, and we are NC with my dad since. I've decided to never drink based on this experience as well as affecting my (18f) mental health. \n\n The trouble is I am now pretty uncomfortable if anyone around me drinks, which I know is unfair to want everyone to be sober 24/7. I also understand that just because someone drinks, it doesn't mean they will treat me badly and it doesn't mean that they are abusing the alcohol. But I am still uncomfortable with it.  It is especially affecting my close relationships where if they drink I am uncomfortable, but at the same time, I don't want to be someone who makes someone quit when there is no harm. And if this person stops drinking just around me, I am partially fine but I still know they drink so in a sense I want to know to ease my mind but alcohol, in general, makes me uncomfortable. \n\nSo, what I really need help with is understanding that drinking can be done safely and responsibly or anything to ease my anxiety really. I'm not sure if this post is appropriate because in a way I want you to explain to me how alcohol can be safe and just be used as a fun thing or somewhat.",

            "selftext": "So I am reading something by an addiction researcher.  She says alcoholism is not a progressive disease because if it was then over time as people get older it would be harder and harder to get sober and fewer people would get sober as they get older. Hshe says however that based on studies the opposite it is true that as people get older they are more likely to get sober which means that alcoholism is not progressive.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how to understand this. I\u2019ve had more sober time as I\u2019ve gotten older but when I\u2019ve drank it\u2019s been worse over time and as my drinking has gotten worse I\u2019ve also been more likely to stop.\n\nSay over the last five years, my drinking has been worse than ever but I\u2019ve also been sober 3.5 of the last 5 years.",

This was from my ages of 13-21. She also has total symptoms of being a narcissist. She is never one to blame herself and has said insanely hurtful things to my dad and his family, me, and has been pretty isolated these last eight years. But all those struggles aside, she says she's \"not a bad alcoholic\" because she only drinks beer. How can I show her that even if it's just beer, it's still an illness that needs to be treated? She also takes a small dose of pain pills as well as sleeping pills, which as we know, is extremely dangerous to combine with alcohol. Any advice on any of this would help, but I really need to just get her to see that being addicted to beer is still a problem, and her ego is so big, it's hard for her to see. Thank you guys.",

I didn't drink as much and mostly kept it to the weekends, but when we had work parties I was always the one who drank the most. Sober for the most part, but I couldn't stop drinking when I had my first drip of alcohol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was a few years ago, but the trend continued and I have now realized that my drinking habits has costed me more than a few friendships, job opportunities, and has overall made me a bad person.

This night made me remember why I hate alcohol. \n\nThen there's another situation, when I came home (my dad was also out), my dad was passed out outside, the car door was fucked, puke everywhere. He stopped drinking 18 years ago. The worst part is, he embarrassed himself so much yesterday (there's just like on club/bar here). I saw him from a distance. I'm so afraid everyone will know him for it or took pictures or something. Can you guys tell me on how to deal with all the embarrassment anxiety?",

            "selftext": "I don't know for sure, but I have several things that are of growing concern to me. Full disclosure, I'm drunk while typing this. Not sure if that matters. I'm 31, and I've had...a life. My dad was an alcoholic, and took his own life when I was 10. I've been deeply depressed (confirmed by a therapist) for a large portion of my life.\n\n\nOddly enough, I never truly felt depressed until my (at least I got it out of the way early?) divorce at age 24. It had zero to do with alcohol, I was barely (maybe three drinks a month) drinking at the time, we were just a bad match and it took us a few years to realize it. I drank more than I was accustomed to to get me through it, but I was still very much in control of myself, and went several months at a time without drinking when I was on a fitness kick, so it wasn't even a concern.\n\nI started officially drinking to dull the pain after my following relationship (I'll call her Elizabeth)fell apart. We dated for just over a year, and almost five years later, I'm not only still not over her, but somehow just as hung up on her now as I was when it fell apart. Again, I cam say with full honesty our breakup had zero to do with alcohol, it was a \"community issue\", which she never communicated to me was a problem until after it was too late. Whatever. That's neither here nor there. That's the first time I ever truly dabbled in the term \"drown your sorrows\". It was still well under my control. At the time, I was working as a personal trainer, and living the lifestyle. I drank to make myself feel better on the weekends, but still followed a strict diet and got myself into the best shape of my life. I'd probably still be a personal trainer to this day if it meant actually helping people and not just selling training packages to people who may or may not have been able to afford it. I've always considered myself a virtuous person, and I'm the furthest thing from a salesman, so I left only because of personal conflict with the job.\n\nYears pass, and nothing but a few meaningless sexual encounters and random, still meaningless relationships, still very hung up on Elizabeth. Jobs come and jobs go. I get a therapist, I go on meds, I'm not over her, but I try and live my life. Get an apartment with my best friend. Things seem okay.\n\nUntil they don't.\n\nI find out Elizabeth is dating again and go off the deep end. I go on a week long bender. At some point I punch a speed limit sign and break my hand. I reach out to friends, all of whom support me, but I start drinking heavily. I take maybe a month off drinking (just to prove to myself I can) before getting back into it heavier than before. I sink deeper into depression. Therapy, medication, and exercise do nothing for me. I dabble a bit (thank the gods it didn't get further than that) in cocaine. I date a stripper for a few months. Nothing stems my depression.\n\nA few years, a few meaningless jobs, and  a few meaningless sexual partners later, and the only difference is that I've lost all motivation to exercise, I sleep more than ever, and I call one day without drinking a positive development. I'm drinking because I feel obligated to, because at least when I'm drunk I'm more than just sad. I swore when I woke up in a pile of puke on my floor with a sprained elbow (of which I remember nothing but a vague memory of tripping in my bathtub) I'd reign it in, but that lasted a week tops. I'm in my overdraft but spending money on alcohol every day anyways. I realize I shouldn't be doing this, but I am anyways, and I can't justify it any more than \"I'm depressed, so I want to\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy name is Kyle, and I think I'm an alcoholic.",

            "selftext": "If this is the wrong place to post, let me know. I'll try and keep it brief. \n\n6 months ago, I wouldn't even think I'd be here, posting this because before 2019 started, I had this handled. There was nothing to handle. I was purely a social drinker. And as long as I wasn't drinking alone, I was ok, right? Mid-January, I started drinking alone for the quick buzz (brandy, and it really didn't take much), I was on winter break and there was nothing else to do. \n\nThen I'd start to buy more liquor. Once the semester started (5th year if it counts), it started to be a way to wind down. I'd wind down every so often, then once a week, then twice a week and I started to keep an extra bottle in my room so I didn't run out. Brandy and wine turned to whiskey. Now it's 3 times a week (with two of those times starting out with just a taste/waft and then just binging).\n\nWent from buying with my card to cash. I have alcoholics on both sides of the family. I didn't want them to think I was succumbing and I definitely didn't want them to hassle me for drinking. I've never seen my dad drink and my mom was always measured about whatever she does drink.\n\nI went to see Endgame with a friend on Thursday. I was drunk by the time we even left and we bought mini bottles on top of it to drink during the movie (I still have one of them). Slept and woke up still drunk a few times during the 3 hr movie. My stomach aches in a way I've never really felt before. I feel extremely numb, physically and emotionally, and triggered to self-harm, but haven't. Forced myself to eat all day (I had no appetite today). Feels like I actively had to try and blend in at my new job and I'm just trying to survive through my finals. \n\nAfter reading up online about it and then everyone's posts here... I'm scared. I've been scared all day. Cause I felt like I understood. I am posting this because I feel like I'm finally looking around at what's been going on in my life and I want to get a handle on it before months turn to years.\n\nI plan to go back to therapy in a few weeks when the semester ends. What else should I do?\n\nTL;DR: I can feel that something is wrong. I'm drinking more often with less control. And I want to get in front of this before shit REALLY hits the fan. Planning to go to therapy. Any advice, help, or whatever is appreciated.",

            "selftext": "Hey guys. I\u2019m an 18 year old male, Freshman in college. \n\nMy dad has always been a heavy drinker, and still is. He gets a bit drunk every night but not beligerent. He used to start fights with my mom and be super angry before we moved 2 years ago, but he\u2019s down from a 12 pack a night to a 6 pack which is good.\n\nI started drinking Freshman year of high school with my two close friends. We would get tallboys from the deli (deli guys don\u2019t care on Staten Island), a few girls we knew, and binge drink in the park. This lasted till Junior year, when we started hanging out with our old elementary school guys - there were 12 in total, and all we did was get obliterated every weekend. Not gonna lie, it was fun. I would have at least 15 shots or 15 beers every time. In the beginning I would puke and have to get carried home, but now I can calmly drink that amount and write a paper. \n\nCollege came around and I went away, and met a kid who had severe depression. I didn\u2019t know he was depressed, but he loved drinking with me. We became good friends and would drink like 3-4 times a week to excess (15 shots). We would go through a handle of rum by ourselves in a dorm room. He got super trashed one night, ran away, and tried to kill himself. He was in the psych ward for 3 days. This is when I began to feel depressed. Around that time I came down with the depression. The agitation, hopelesness, sadness, couldn\u2019t get out of bed. For 5-6 months I was living an empty life. I was so ready to kill myself, if I even had the balls to jump off a bridge or swallow all my ibuprofen. I\u2019ve called the suicide hotline probably 10 times this year. That same kid, my friend, mixed his depression meds and liquor and had a psychotic episode where he tried to beat up some kids and break into their room. He got arrested and suspended from school. Said goodbye to him about a month ago before he flew home, probably won\u2019t see him again. I doubt his parents will let him come back when he\u2019s allowed. \n\nBooze was a fun hobby, but during these 5-6 months, it became a coping mechanism.\n\nMy only other coping mechanism was my faith. I consider myself a practicing Catholic, and I take my religion very seriously.\n\nThe entire year, one of the missionaries at church would notice I would show up to everything hungover - whether it was Sunday Mass or a communiy gathering of some sort. He insisted I give up booze completely - but I never took it to heart. \n\nWe met before the summer and he told me to stop drinking, he was like begging me. \n\nI have drank everyday since I\u2019ve been home, and even drank while my parents were asleep and puked in the hotel room because I had so much cheap wine. Every break this year, when I was home, in addition to partying and hitting up bars with my friends, I would stay up till 5am when my family was asleep drinking by myself. I have thrown up a few times because of this. \n\nAlthough my depression symptoms have become much more tolerable, I notice they are prolonged. Now, hangovers give me severe psychotic anxiety and fear filled episodes where I\u2019ll be fearful and paranoid, and when I close my eyes I see my thoughts. Even the smallest amount of alcohol will give me some sort of hangover now.\n\nI am never not at least a little hungover, so I don\u2019t know what\u2019s hangover induced or if my depression has evolved into something else. However, given the fact that I drink so frequently and this is what I feel in the aftermath, my gut feeling is that if I give up booze the symptoms will subside and I\u2019ll give my brain time to heal.\n\nThe one thing is that all my friends here at home do is drink and party - all that WE do is drink and party, and I really want to participate. I love partying. If I stop drinking, I won\u2019t be able to have as good of a time as I used to. I also just bought a new fake ID for 200 dollars and its coming in the mail.\n\nI also have a new job, so I can\u2019t wake up hungover on 2 hours of sleep because my hangxiety woke me up at 3 am.\n\nI think the missionary I know is right. I don\u2019t want to live a life like this. If not for myself, for my faith. My issues are caused by my alcohol consumption, and I need to change.",

            "selftext": "Hi folks \n\nFor the last 7 years I've known I've been drinking 'too much' following the death of my husband.  A post in another sub made me realize that I am actually 'drinking to feel worse' in the hope that either I commit suicide or drink myself to the point where one or another medical problem causes death.  \n\nI've reached out for help, only to find it sadly lacking.  No one seems to care that much.  Sure the few family members/friends I have left rally round when there's a crisis.  Sure the EMS will respond if I take an overdose.  However, beyond the initial 'crisis point' everyone goes back to their own lives, leaving me to stew in my own juices.  There is no ongoing support or help.  Jesus, is it any wonder that people turn to drugs and/or alcohol?!\n\nOne of these days I will drink enough that the pain/fear is outweighed by the wish to cease to exist",

            "selftext": "So me, my brother, and my dad have noticed that when my mom drinks her personality changes. She\u2019ll bring up controversial topics and argue with you about them, be mean, and get really upset about seemingly innocuous things. It was unusually bad tonight. I showed her a comedy clip I thought she would enjoy and  she thought i was making fun of her and started CRYING. The thing is, she really doesn\u2019t drink that much. Like 1-2 beers a night but it\u2019s very consistent. Now that I can think about it I don\u2019t remember the last time she didn\u2019t have a drink with dinner. But because she doesn\u2019t drink in excess I haven\u2019t really worried about her being an alcoholic i just thought having to deal with beer mom was an inconvenience I\u2019d have to deal with. But after tonight was so bad I started looking up stuff and \u201calcoholism\u201d kept popping up. Could she be an alcoholic? It runs in her family, her brother had a problem but caught it and went on those meds that make you throw up if you drink and he doesn\u2019t drink anymore and her uncle was an alcoholic. \n\n\nTL;DR my mom\u2019s personality changes dramatically after just one beer. I\u2019ve never seen her drink more than 2 beers in a sitting but she drinks very consistently nearly every day. My dad has told her before that she becomes someone else when she drinks and even her kids (me and my brother) notice it, nothing has changed. Could she be an alcoholic?",

I stopped after a little more than a year after realizing the damage I\u2019m doing to myself and plan on never going back to it. Problem is, I\u2019m a little scared that I have done some noticeable damage to my brain already. After my year long hiatus on alcohol, I noticed that my personality changed completely from being eccentric, to depressed and shy. I had really bad brain fog, but that seemed to have died down substantially. Overall I just generally feel a lot more \u2018limited\u2019 than before I started drinking. Could be placebo and/or self doubt, but it\u2019s obvious that damage was done. Aside from that, is there anything I can do to help myself and possibly reverse the damage done to my brain? I just want to make sure that my prefrontal cortex and all the other parts are fully developed and not thrown out of whack. Thanks.",

I just wanted to say that today while I was browsing online, I came upon an ad for Alavida, an alcoholism aid which combines medication, counselling and technology. I clicked the ad because I know I need help. (I'm a closet alcoholic who drinks 2 bottles of wine per night). I chatted with a representative to find out it costs $580/month to actually get any sort of help. That might be cheap for a counselling program (I'm not sure, I can't afford that and I have never had counselling out of fear of the costs), but my issue is they make you break down your addiction and face certain aspects of it in their \"self assessment quiz\" which comes before they give you your estimate. You become positive and excited that this may be the tool that can finally help you beat this before you are slapped with the fee. $580.00 (CAD) per month.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is my experience. When I expressed that this is very unhelpful, they gave me the number for a crisis line. I'm so discouraged. I need help and I am flabbergasted that there is a company out there taking advantage of addicts hungry eyes for legitimate HELP.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyone else feel his way?",

            "selftext": "To preface; I am student who is about to graduate over the summer and leave the industry and culture, but until I do, I still have to pay the bills. \n\nI decided to go sober when I realized I had a problem not sticking to a set limit of drinks and breaking multiple promises to my fianc\u00e9 that I wouldn\u2019t come home drunk anymore. My father and his father were alcoholics and didn\u2019t have healthy lives or relationships, I\u2019ve said I never want to turn out like them. My wake up call was when my fianc\u00e9 said I was doing a terrible job at that and was becoming them. Enough was enough, I got up the next day and decided to go sober. I went to my EXTENSIVE liquor cabinet and one by one I poured every bottle down the drain and tossed them all out. And I am talking about the good stuff, Blantons, Pappy 12yr, Monkey 47 gin, etc. Basically I tossed nearly a grand worth down the drain and it felt great! Best choice I have ever made and now I look forward to learning that short life and living a a full one with my fianc\u00e9 and future family. \n\nHowever, I still have to go to work and be around drinks, people who drink the drinks, and everything that goes along with it. I\u2019m actually getting disgusted by it now. It turns nice people into complete assholes who say and do things they later regret. Not to mention they pay to have that service. \n\nI have had a lifetime of drinking and I could give a whole seminar on the intricacies of different spirits, wines, and craft beer. I truly loved it. But, I am ready and want to leave that all behind me. Honestly, despite my library of liquors, I rarely drank at home or alone, it was mostly there for entertainment purposes. My problem was saying \u2018No\u2019 to others. I am highly social, and I couldn\u2019t turn down someone when they said let\u2019s have a drink after work, let\u2019s go to another bar since we have an Uber and don\u2019t have to drive, let\u2019s do shots! Once I had one, you could talk me into drinking 10. I just loved the social aspect of it all. But now I realized you absolutely don\u2019t need booze to still be social. In fact I enjoy sober conversations much more. \n\nAny other bartenders or ex bartenders out there going through something similar? How are you managing, any tips you have, or I plan on leaving the industry soon, do you as well or do you want to stay? \n\nSo glad I found this sub, you people are amazing and enjoy hearing the success stories, gives me goals to work towards. Thank you all for reading! Have a happy sober Friday!",

Anyways I thought the date went well and I liked her a lot but she pulled out weed in my car when I was driving her home.  I texted her after and said I can't have that because 'I have a criminal record, I'm an alcoholic, etc.'  Long story short there will be no second date.\n\nI just feel so shitty because it seems like the field is so tiny for someone my age in recovery (I'm not interested in other alcoholics).  I can be around drugs and alcohol and not be bothered but I just think no girl my age wants to date someone who doesnt drink.  My confidence is destroyed, I was super nervous on the date, not myself (I feel like I have no game whatsoever sober) and overall I'm just an expert catastrophizer.

I am the chlich\u00e9 of a binge drinker, one drink and you can't stop me anymore, I would chug an entire bottle of vodka if my friends wouldn't stop me. Do you guys have any tips to stop the urge of drinking when my friends drink? Right now i feel like I can do it, but I have the feeling, that the temptation tomorrow will be too much for me.",

            "selftext": "Before I start, let me just say that I realize I have a serious problem and I know I will be told to see a doctor.  However I need support too.\n\nI had a severe sleepwalking accident (unrelated to alcohol) last summer. They kept me in a coma for 4 days and I am damn lucky to be alive, bc I sustained a severe traumatic brain injury and had bruising on 80% of my body which led to rhabdomyolysis. In total, I was in the hospital for a week, but before I was released, no one told me about the effects or the recovery after sustaining a brain injury. \n\nIt has been hell. And I have made some poor choices since getting out of the hospital. I am prescribed Klonopin, but am supposed to be tapering my dose as of this month. For a couple of months now, I have been abusing alcohol, phenibut and found a source for extra Klonopin. I am nearing the end of my phenibut taper, which has been tough. But I have stuck with it. However my alcohol use has increased to almost daily and last night, for the first time in years, I blacked out.  And I am still taking far too much Klonopin. This morning when I woke up, I didn't feel hungover, but I noticed my legs felt like they were shaking even though there was no noticeable movement. My anxiety was through the roof.  I had leftover hard liquor from last night and and even though it sounded disgusting, I drank some a bit ago to see if it would curb the symptoms I felt. When it did, I realized I was in BIG trouble.\n\nAt this point, I don't know if cold turkey is an option. I feel like I need to see a doctor but my pcp is only available on Tuesdays and Thursdays so getting into him will take weeks. I know I have to face this head on, but inpatient detox isn't an option for me. I live alone with a cat who relies  on me for everything and I don't have a friend I can call and ask to stop in to feed her. If I leave her and go into the hospital, I don't know what will happen to her and she has kidney and stomach issues. I am not trying to use this an as excuse. I know I need help and that I've likely permanently fucked up my GABA receptors. Should I go into a walk in clinic? The ER will keep me there, I am thinking and I don't know how my cat will survive without a caretaker.\n\nPlease keep any judgment to yourselves. I am asking for advice... In the last year I moved back to Canada after being gone 17 years bc my father has Lewy body dementia. My ex and I divorced after a 17 year relationship and I don't know what's up or down anymore. I think about suicide all the time but my cat keeps me here. I am sure that sounds pathetic, but it's true.\n\nI don't know what to do. But what I am doing currently is killing me. I need some support and some real talk regarding this and I don't have a support network here in Canada.\n\nPart of me thinks drinking myself to death is the best option. Surely with Klonopin in the mix, it can't be that difficult. \n\nI am TERRIFIED to post this but I am going to anyway bc I know I can't manage this alone.  Thanks in advance for any words of wisdom and advice.",

She received the cirrhosis of liver diagnosis about a year and a half ago and also has kidney damage and other issues.  Unfortunately, the alcohol is winning this war and she continues drinking daily.  She chooses to go out to bars and drink rather than stay home which often leads to her falling on sidewalks or getting taken directly from bars to the hospital for various reasons.  Her blood alcohol content is consistently .4+ (over 5x the legal limit) which leads me to wonder if she is drinking enough to get to that high of a BAC or does the liver damage cause a lesser amount of alcohol intake cause a higher BAC than would occur for someone who drank the same amount with a healthy liver?  Additionally, I struggle with what to do in this situation as I watch this train wreck unfold before my eyes.  Are there any places where a person in this situation can live and receive care and live?  Thank you.",

I started smoking weed when I was 14, I became addicted to meth when I was 16, etc. I got pregnant with my son at 17, so I cleaned up and I had 2 children and I was good when pregnant /breastfeeding. I fell into drinking when my kids were young, maybe 1&amp;3 and I was a high functioning alcoholic for 12 years. I struggled with my addiction pretty much by myself out of embarrassment, I was a complete closet drinker, I tried to be the best Mom I could, while catering to my alcohol addiction. Like I would be incredibly hung over at baseball games at 9am it was awful. I never let myself sleep in or be hungover, god it makes me sick just thinking how awful I felt all the time. \n\nI quit drinking 4 months ago and I haven\u2019t had a drink since. This is the longest I\u2019ve been sober since I was 13 (20 years) there are no words I could use to describe how happy I actually feel. I\u2019m not even going to say I\u2019m never going to drink again, I know I won\u2019t drink again, but I\u2019m not going to say it. I actually fee terrified of alcohol. \n\nThe guilt I have for what my kids have had to see and experience is heart breaking. They deserved a better Mom, sometimes I was an embarrassment to them, and they lost to alcohol. None of my friends or family knew how bad it was, I think they thought I liked to party but they had no idea I was drinking from the time I got home from work until I went to bed, and my kids kept it a secret too. \n\nI\u2019ve never said anything to my kids or addressed it with them, I often wonder if they\u2019re waiting for me to start drinking again, and I think they resent me. They\u2019re such such good kids, so kind, smart, and loving. Whenever anyone says I did such a good job at raising them I know deep down they\u2019re who they are because of themselves, if I did anything it was make their life harder. I wish I could go back to when they were little and got a chance to enjoy them more. Alcohol has stolen so much from me and I\u2019ll never be able to get that time back or fix it. \n\nI\u2019m just not sure of what to say to them or how to say. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t say anything and just keep doing it.",

She told me he listens to me, and he will most likely take action. Now, in a way I feel she\u2019s throwing this responsibility on me. \nHis drinking got very bad, and he doesn\u2019t seem to care. They barely talk, and my dad spends most of the day drunk.\n\nI am torn between feeling like my mother is putting this on my shoulders and knowing that I am his daughter and maybe I can help.\n\nI have no idea how to approach this subject with him.\nHe always gets defensive and I also don\u2019t want to hurt his feelings. We can only talk through the phone as they live a 6 hours drive from me and I know I need to catch him sober to have a talk because I can\u2019t reason with him when he is drunk. My mom told me to lie to him and have him come over the pretext that I need help with something, and take him to the psychiatrist I am seeing. But I can\u2019t just drag him to a psychiatrist, once because I feel it\u2019s unfair and harsh and second, because if he doesn\u2019t acknowledge he has a problem, a visit to a doctor won\u2019t change much.\n\nPlease, I need any advice you can give me.\nAs much bad blood we had/have I still care for him.\n\nThank you.",

            "selftext": "Thanks for taking the time to read this if you\u2019re about to. I\u2019ll try and be brief. \n\nMy mother has struggled with alcohol for as long as I can remember. When I was in high school it was a common occurrence to come home from school and find her passed out. I\u2019m 27 now and throughout my life the amount of times I\u2019ve gone over to my family home to see my parents and found my mother passed out is far too often to count. This isn\u2019t passed out on the floor type stuff, more asleep on the couch or her bed. \n\nThis came to a head mid 2018 when her drinking started to affect her at work. She was closing up the shop alone and ended up getting hammered at work. A store owner next door found her passed out on the floor and the entire store was flooded. I got a call from an ambulance medic who was called when they found her passed out. I raced to her store to pick her up and talked to ambulance staff and my mother\u2019s boss. They were understanding at the time but this incident triggered my mother to lose her job. She hasn\u2019t been able to find a job since. \n\nAfter this incident her drinking improved for awhile and then has slowly regressed back to how it was. In the last 2 weeks she has basically locked herself away for days at a time and is just drinking until she passes out. My dad is working his ass off to support them both and I have a full time job which means I can\u2019t be at the house during the day to make sure she doesn\u2019t drink. We both feel like we need to constantly babysit her.  \n\nAll I can think about is how my mother is going to have a fall and hit her head at home or drink herself into a coma and it\u2019s really weighing on me. I don\u2019t want to look back in 6 months and not be able to face myself because my father and I didn\u2019t do enough to prevent this. \n\nMy mother acts like there\u2019s nothing wrong. She believes she hides everything well and that there\u2019s no issue. If she\u2019s just secretly drinking and passing out she\u2019ll say she hasn\u2019t been feeling well and is just sick etc. it makes me and my father feel like idiots because we all know what\u2019s happening and why. We\u2019ve talked about it with her numerous times, it will improve then go back to how it always has been. \n\nI\u2019m at the point where I\u2019m scared of losing her and I don\u2019t think I will be able to live with myself if something happened. \n\nWhat can I do to help my mother when she won\u2019t even admit or recognise it\u2019s a huge problem we need to deal with? \n\nThanks again for reading, I really appreciate any response that can help me process this or put a plan together.",

            "selftext": "24F, here. A bit of background:\n\nI've had substance abuse issues since I was 18. I experienced some trauma just out of highschool (I mention that because I THINK that's when I started self-medicating?) At that point, I had lost an entire group of friends (before the drugs), and for one reason or another, couldn't/wouldn't reach out to someone or handle it.\nI knew my mom had a xanax prescription that she barely used, and I started dipping into it. Seemed okay at first, because I was just using it to sleep. But obviously the problem snowballed. \n\nIt was disturbingly easy for me to get a benzo prescription at 18, which I abused on and off for a few years. Was never questioned, I'd always have a refill when I needed it. Eventually I decided to stop using them (I don't remember why or HOW), and eventually replaced it with booze/weed. Marijuana is my go-to (though I need to lay off of that as well, I'm a daily smoker). I didn't start drinking to the point of getting sick until a couple years ago. And it wasn't a daily, consistent thing. I'd drink, get sick, swear off of it for a couple weeks, repeat the process. Not necessarily good, but it was manageable. Which brings me to now. \n\nThe job I work requires me to be completely alone in a building for hours at a time. There were times where I felt like having a couple beers before work, but I eventually got too comfortable and started bringing my flask to work. It's VERY easy for me to drink and hide it during my shift. I have some form of alcohol with me at work probably every other day. I've also brought my vape pen to work on several occasions. \n\nI'm 25 in a few weeks and feel like an embarrassment. Dropped out of college because I don't want an art degree, I make way less than someone my age should be making, living paycheck to paycheck (due in part to my addiction problems), and I can't support my husband the same way he supports me, and I know I'm not doing my part in the marriage. I want to get sober and go learn a trade. I NEED to do something. \n\nThis is all a big ramble, but I've deleted it a few times and I just want to post it before I change my mind again. \n\nSincerely, \n\n\nBuzzed at work.",

At first I was always upfront about it and would get no replies on the internet dating sites. So I stopped being upfront with it and the likes poured in. Usually in the first date they would ask me about my profile about being a non-drinker and of course I would have to tell them my story. To No Surprise I would never hear from them again even though they were interested. On two occasions I was going out for at least a month before I told them and once again the same result relationship ended. My question is do I just bury this and not ever tell anybody about it .I might have to move because it's going to come up sooner or later.

            "selftext": "I'm struggling to change even though I know I need to. \n\nThe inevitable cognitive dissonance that comes out of simultaneously wanting something and hating it is exhausting. Then when you pile on the shame of disappointing not only your loved ones but yourself, the desire to obliterate yourself feels overwhelming. \n\nDrinking, even more so than smoking, is the only socially acceptable form of suicide. To get very far down this road, I think maybe you kinda have to hate yourself. \n\nI've read self-help books, been to meetings, done years of therapy, have a prescription for anxiety medicine. I've meditated. I've tried channeling my nervous energy into hobbies and chores. So far, nothing has taken away my desire to drink.  I'm just really tired of fighting. \n\nI can white-knuckle it for about 10 days or so and I start to feel a lot more confident and comfortable in my own skin. I've recorded videos for myself when I'm sober to watch when I am craving. Yet, here I still am, counting the hours until I can go home, and pretty much resigned to drinking again tonight. My mind keeps coming back to it, ever since about 10 or 11 AM. I think I'm going to cave. \n\nAnyone have any ideas on how to climb out before you hit rock bottom? Words of encouragement? War stories? Tips and tricks? \n\nThanks in advance for whatever help you can offer. You guys are great, I'm glad this community exists.",

            "selftext": "I drink regularly (like every Friday night) since more than 10 years ago, with some rare gaps of a week or several weeks (usually trip or work related). Since about 5 years ago, I drink more often, usually about several times a week, about 1 L to 3 L of beer after work at night. Sometimes I can keep drinking from the night all through the next day, and at the following night I stop.\n\nWhat happened to me a few days ago was something that made me concerned because I couldn\u2019t explain it and it seems it was for the first time. I think I came across the name of it online by chance.\n\nMy friend came from abroad to visit me for a few weeks, and in the last couple of weeks we drank often, usually every day or every other day and usually booze. I remember the last few days before this happened, we were on vodka and some tequila. Then, at about 3am, I just got tired of drinking, put my drink on the table and went to bed.\n\nThe next day I was hungover, but not very badly, and I didn\u2019t want to drink. I ate something, although the food didn\u2019t taste very well, and just did something about the house. Later in the evening, I drank with my friend, but only a little (1 or 2 drinks) because I really didn\u2019t feel like, and I also wanted to sleep. So I lay down in my bed at about 10pm, but I couldn\u2019t fall asleep.\n\nAt about midnight I started to feel like I was hot and cold at the same time, and I began sweating profusely. The profuse sweating (pouring down sweat) had happened to me before a few times after heavy drinking, and, although it was something strange to me, I thought it was just part of a bad hangover, during which I just took a shower and then felt much better, kind of like the hangover partially came out and away with the sweat. So this time I just used a towel to wipe it away. My friend got up and turned on the light. I sat down next to him and we smoked, but right before this, my hands and body started shaking uncontrollably. I just couldn\u2019t stop it, and the shaking was quite strong. My friend asked me if I was cold. I said, \u201cYes, I am very cold.\u201d He said, \u201cThat\u2019s strange, it\u2019s 20 C outside.\u201d Then I noticed I felt some kind of fear or anxiety: for example, I was afraid to open the closet or go to the bathroom, and when opened, observed the area with fear. But I remembered that years ago my psychologist told me that hangovers may cause the sense of fear, and just accepted it. After a while (it was already about 3am) I felt like I couldn\u2019t find a place for myself: I didn\u2019t know whether to go get some water, or read a website, or smoke, or something else \u2013 thoughts seemed to be racing and mixing in a random way. That made me more anxious because I didn\u2019t know what was going on and what to do. Then I said to myself, \u201cJust stop it now! I\u2019ll go and help my friend with his computer.\u201d (I do programming and he is not very good with tech.) I sat down at my friend\u2019s computer and started doing basic stuff, but I couldn\u2019t concentrate, e.g., I was looking at two windows with two different kinds of content and couldn\u2019t really remember which content belonged to which window while looking at them that very moment. The whole view in front of me was a little blurry, or slowly drifting to the side. Then I wondered if that content was really supposed to be there (in reality it was). At this point I started noticing something highly unusual: when I moved the mouse cursor with the touchpad, the cursor moved to a different position, as if somebody else was controlling it. \u201cThat\u2019s just a glitch,\u201d I thought, \u201cI just installed Ubuntu 18.04 on my friend\u2019s computer, it is a super-secure OS, nobody can just take control of the default installation remotely\u201d. I tried again, the cursor moved away by itself again. When I finally took control of it for a second and opened some menu or window, it closed and other windows started opening by themselves, and I completely lost control of the GUI. \u201cWhat the fuck?!\u201d I thought, \u201cThis computer is hacked! Somebody else is using it!\u201d The OS seemed to be behaving erratically, new menus and windows kept opening and closing by themselves. Horrified, I shut down the computer using the power button. \u201cBut how? But why?\u201d I thought, \u201cEven if my friend, who is very inept with tech, told someone all his passwords, it\u2019s still highly unlikely to be taken remote control of.\u201d\n\nI stepped to the side, sat down with my friend and tried to help him pack his stuff \u2013 he was leaving that morning. I still felt uneasy, but not that bad. Some everyday sounds seemed to have words attached to them, kind of like lyrics to the melody, my imagination just automatically filled them in. At about 5am we took a taxi to the airport, he left and I went back home. He left me some Klonopin to help me sleep, so I took 1 mg of it and went to sleep.\n\nI woke up because my friend came to my place again. He said his place abroad couldn\u2019t host him anymore, so he had to return because he had nowhere to stay, and there was a family with him from a third country, where they said they could rent him a small place. (At this moment I didn\u2019t even come to question the fact that it would be a 6-hour flight to his place and back, but everything seemed absolutely real.) Then I presumably fell asleep again, saw some dreams (some sad but no nightmares), and woke up at about 7pm feeling well-rested and much better.\n\nSo, on the Internet I accidentally found out about DT and some things seem to be aligned. Was it really the case? If so, what could be the degree of it \u2013 very mild to medium? Did anyone here have anything similar?",

I hope this is okay to ask here, if it breaks any subreddit rules please feel free to report and remove it!\n\nI'm a writer working on a story with an alcoholic character. The alcoholism isn't the focus of the story, but I plan to have her recover as part of the plot. I don't really have any personal experience with alcoholism, so I thought I'd go to Reddit and hear some recovery stories first hand!\n\nFor anyone that would be willing to share, I'd love to hear more about what it was like getting sober. My biggest question is about how long it took for you to start feeling \"good\" or even \"better\" after withdrawal symptoms calmed down. Also, if you don't mind talking about it, what were some of your biggest symptoms and challenges while going through withdrawal?\n\nAgain, if this type of post isn't allowed feel free to delete it, I'm just looking for some more information. And congratulations in advance to anyone brave enough to share their story!",

            "selftext": "So I had my second group session today. I was on time this time (just!) and remembered to take my drink diaries.\n\nThis time there were 9 people, 4 women and 5 men. Only about half of the group from last week returned.\n\nWe started with a check in where we say who we are and what we drink. I confessed to drinking a bit more this post week and my key worker asked why I thought that was. I said I was a bit more depressed because it was my birthday, but also I think I've been trying to be more conscious of counting the drinks.\n\nSome of the new people introduced themselves and two had been in hospital recently for withdrawal. This made me feel a bit better about having been admitted myself.\n\nThe topic for this session was how to spot problem drinking. We started just listing the signs we recognise, and then one of the key workers said that all signs pretty much fall into I've of three categories: social, psychological and physical.\n\nAfter a break we were given a case study of two people, and asked to point out the signs in their circumstances which indicated problem drinking.\n\nThen we did a similar thing but with our own lives.\n\nI was still very anxious this time and was visibly shaking, but I'm convinced that was anxiety rather than withdrawal. Overall this week was less scary than last week.\n\nThere was a new woman there this week who I think was drinking during the session. She was sipping from an energy drink bottle during the session, and became progressively louder, more talkative and started slurring her words. There's a rule about not attending intoxicated but also a rule about no shaming so no one said anything.",

            "selftext": "Hey guys, \n\nI'm currently on my second day of tapering down to 0 and staying there as long as possible. I'm taking it day by day and found it impossible to go cold turkey. I was previously binge drinking 7-12 drinks per night for around a year and a half straight and stepped down by cutting the amount roughly in half each day. I had 5 yesterday very spread out in the evening, tonight is 2.8 (two 16oz). I'm currently doing much more okay than I had expected, but the cravings are nagging me like crazy and I'm not even at 0 yet. Had my drinks around 6, and it's now 2AM. What can I do to keep them at bay? \n\nI do have Klonopin that was prescribed to take on it's own if I have withdrawal symptoms during the day, and have used it sparingly. No DT's as of now, but firmly believe that script has helped me avoid a seizure on day one after how severe that was and how much I had on my idiotic \"last hurrah\". \n\n*As a disclaimer, I should note that I don't particularly care for benzos and it's a very short script that was written specifically for this. My therapist knows, and I'm checking in with him throughout this. It sucks that this is what it has come to, but I need to get sober and continuing to drink is ruining my life and career.",

            "selftext": "I'll try to keep this as short as possible but I wanted to post this because it basically verifies to me something I was worried about - am I an alcoholic?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI lost track of time, but I know it has been more than 30 days. I've been a binge drinker for about 6 years. And it got to a point a few months ago where I wondered if if I was a true alcoholic. I decided to test myself, and stop drinking cold turkey for 30 days straight. The first 2 days sucked - I had minor shakes and insomnia. I was irritable. I had temptations. After day 5, I felt completely rejuvenated and like my normal self. I could sleep better. I wasn't irritable. I didn't have any shakes at all.  I'm not sure exactly, but I 'd guess around after day 8 or 9, I just stopped thinking about it all together. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward 2 or 3 weeks later, I still haven't thought about drinking at all. I almost completely forgot about this experiment. I haven't had any desire to drink or get drunk at all.  I just went back to how my life was before I became obsessed with getting drunk.  In fact, even thinking about drinking like I used to or getting drunk almost makes me sick to my stomach. I can't believe I enjoyed doing that to myself. I'm still gonna wait a while before I have a drink because I want to lose some weight and pursue a healthier lifestyle. Who knows, maybe I'll have a drink at the 4th of July or something? Lol. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut this takes a huge weight off of my shoulders because I really was concerned that I had developed an psychological and physical addiction to it. For example, one of my worries was,  \"am I going to end up in the hospital due to seizures?\". I mean there's a bunch of issues that alcoholics have to deal with, and I wish them all the best.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you made it this far into my story, thank you very much for your time. If you have any constructive feedback or advice, please let me know. I am open minded.",

            "selftext": "Apologies for the long post and I'm not sure this is the right sub but this is an issue I really want to try and get to the bottom of. Hopefully some people here will have relevent experience to answer my inquiry. So I'm 18 M from the UK, and as you will know, there is a huge underage drinking culture here - house parties since the age of 14 sort of stuff. So I'm not totally new to consuming alcohol but in the past 18 months I have been experiencing a lot of problems when I drink beers/lager and I've become very fed up of it as it's starting to have a detrimental effect on my experiences at parties and nights out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo try and explain everything the best I can, no matter what I drink, I am a slow drinker. When I'm in the pub with my friends, it'll usually take me 2 or 3 times as long to finish a pint than they do. If I take a big gulp of the beer, I'll feel instantly sick and I reckon that I could easily throw up off of my first sip of alcohol if it was large enough and sometimes causes abdominal pain. When I do take large sips and feel sick, I sometimes have to zone out for 10 seconds or so to recuperate and get rid of the sick feeling. The variation of beer is a very important factor in this: the more flavour a beer has, the more it makes me feel sick. I have found that certain Fosters' draughts go down a treat for me and it's got the least flavour I have found, but when it's in a can, it's a bit more difficult to drink. Other lagers like Stella that have a lot more flavour are a huge issue and I doubt I could finish a pint of it in less than an hour. The biggest problem is with ales. Around Christmas time I was out with some friends and someone got me ale for their round and I actually threw up within having drunk two fingers' worth. Nevertheless, I try to avoid these drinks and just stick to lager, but it often still causes so many issues, sometimes leaving me feeling off for a large portion of the night. I usually find mixers a lot easier to drink, but I still avoid shots as I don't feel as though I will be able to stomach it. When I drank a few years ago, I can't remember having these issues and everything just went down a lot easier. Another factor that seems to affect how I react is whether I have a full stomach or not. If I drink whilst feeling full, I am far more likely to throw up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is only one occasion in the past year where I got black out drunk and I drank the majority of a 3 litre bottle of Frosty Jacks at a rugby social which is a 7.5% cider that you can get in the UK for about \u00a33. lol. But other times I have drank cider since I still experience this rejection. Sometimes, there are nights that I am able to drink relatively well and other that I just cannot stomach anything. Although I have mentioned some possible connections, it's quite often very random (or a factor that I am not aware of). A lot of the time, this issue is so limiting that I am not actually able to become intoxicated, which as a teen attending parties and nights out where everyone else is drunk can become quite depressing. I am also going off to university in a few months and I really don't want to be having these same experiences there and ruining more of my nights.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt just seems very odd to me that this happens instantly and I feel sure that it is not an allergy as I take antihistamines daily for other health issues which would reduce the effects of any allergic reaction and have been tested for alcohol allergy (unrelated)  with it not showing any reaction. I have also been tested for celiacs etc and nothing was found. I underwent extensive allergy testing in 2018 that resulted in the diagnosis of a condition called chronic spontaneous urticaria, which basically means they tested allergies for pretty much everything and they couldn't find anything so concluded my body just produces histamines, causing allergic reactions (which my drugs keep under control).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe easy solution is for me to just avoid beers and lagers but within my social spheres there is huge lad culture and pressure to drink beer (not that I have an issue with any of this) but drinking anything else will result with me receiving excessive ridicule and abuse and I also don't want to be the guy in the group that drinks the more 'girly' drinks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone else has experienced this 'instant' rejection of alcohol I'd love to know whether you found out the root of the issue or whether anyone has suggestions of steps I can take to reduce these effects.",

My family have tried everything in the book and she simply cannot stop drinking. What can I do?

She just tries to hide it better, but as you may know it\u2019s kind of hard to hide being drunk. I admit I\u2019ve been her enabler for a while, I tried not to, but we live together and it\u2019s hard. I don\u2019t buy her alcohol, but I don\u2019t stop her. Our relationship hasn\u2019t been the same in a long time. I want to help her, but I don\u2019t know what to do. There is a lot more to this, but that\u2019s the jist..I\u2019m just someone with an alcoholic partner..who I love and I don\u2019t know what to do anymore.",

            "selftext": "I have been battling alcholism for a few years now. My issues maybe aren't classified as alcoholism in the traditional sense... I don't feel an urge to drink constantly when I'm home alone or anything. But instead, I have a problem with drinking when I go out. I don't know how to stop. Last weekend, I went to a simple brunch, and ended up drinking around $200 worth of alcohol at several different bars, and hitting on every girl I saw, spending money buying them drinks, even if she had a boyfriend, and almost (deservedly) getting my ass kicked. I would steal other people's drinks while blacked out and just finish them, until I hit a point where I collapsed and passed out. I have been feeling miserable since that point, knowing that I made a fool of myself, and knowing that this isn't the first time. I have been similarly drunk before, and every time I pledge to stop and get help, and I go for a few weeks being fine, and then I go out again casually and it happens again. I know that part of it is my selfishness for choosing not to stop, but I feel so reckless when I drink, almost like I am invincible. I don't want to end up hurting someone else or myself even more. I feel so ashamed of myself, and want this to end.",

One of those jobs is for a dying business so revenue and my personal income is way down from previous years.  Because of this, tension at work is very high.  In anticipation of the business closing I am in the process of looking a new job, which I absolutely hate job searching, it depresses the hell out of me.\n\nAlso because of the job searching, I gave up smoking weed a week ago in anticipation of a drug test.  For whatever reason, I cannot sleep without smoking.  I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had any REM sleep in the last week.  Having a toddler and two jobs makes life beyond difficult when I\u2019m exhausted all day long.\n\nIcing on the cake, I injured my lower back a couple months ago and it hurts all day, every. single. day.\n\nI don\u2019t want to go to the doctor for any of this.  My insurance sucks, so doctor visits are very expensive.\n\nI\u2019ve never been more miserable in my entire life.  \n\nI\u2019ve been battling alcoholism for the last two years and have been sober since December.  I\u2019m  constantly toying with the idea of drinking again to ease my pain.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do.  I am so upset.\n\nTrying to be the best father I can be while I\u2019m dying on the inside is killing me.\n\nTears are pouring down my face as I type this.  My wife and best friend know something is wrong but don\u2019t know how to help.\n\nI am a fit and healthy person.  I work so hard to make healthy life decisions and I still end up in constant pain and depression.  What the fuck do I do...  I\u2019m on the verge of falling back into the bottle.

            "selftext": "Ill try to keep this as brief as possible. I have been casually dating a man (31M) for a few months. We met at a bar the first few times and whenever I suggested other locations, he kind of did not seem happy with it. His dream was buying his favorite bar and owning it and he wanted to go brewery hopping. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs he learned that I do not drink, he completely stopped hanging out with me on weekends, because weekends were for \"partying and drinking,\" Thats despite me being fine with drinking.. He'd text me hungover on days, saying he want to quit \"and get back to the healthy lifestyle and stop drinking a little too much.\" but the next weekend he's right back at the bars. He was knocked out on a few days and when does he withdraws from me from a few days, he tells me hes sick and ignores my messages after which I assume its because of shame. Hes always sick and sniffing. always. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI never assumed much until alcohol would be mentioned in every single conversation. If I bought a dress for 50 USD , it was as much he spends on beer a week. If I say I want to hit up Ireland, he says he loves the distillery tours there. Alcohol always comes up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe biggest concern was when he lost an official governmental ID and when I asked where he lost it. he said he has no idea. I asked if he lost it at a bar and he avoided the discussion. What he was most concerned about was finding a document that would allow him to keep hitting up bars. That kind of felt off to me in terms of priorities. Should I be concerned?",

            "selftext": "I feel helpless and alone. When should I say enough is enough? Have I done everything in my power to help him? Is there anything I can do? I been with my boyfriend for 6 years. I want to say he's always drank a little too much since teenage years. Just from hearing stories and remembering how things were when we first got together. A few years ago his mother was killed in a car crash and that's when things just went completely down hill. He was only 26 and like anybody this was a completely devastating. She past away 3 days after her birthday. He forgot to wish her a happy birthday. He didnt get to say goodbye to her. After she passed away a family member got angry with him and told him how awful he was for forgetting her birthday. It's something I know haunts him. Things like this happen but I have no way of knowing how he feels or how to help with a pain so great. After a few months he quit the job he had for 5 years. It was a job that was not major and not worth keeping. I left that job myself so I didnt think much of it. I understood. He went through a tremendous loss and I dont blame him for it. He stayed home alot and drank. To the point that it was hard liquor bottles every night. I was stupid and naive and I would drink with him and we would have fun. No real problems. I helped him with food and stuff without a second thought. This went on for about a year. And I didnt really push him. Then I moved back into town and thing between us got very serious. And he eneded up moving in with me and my parents. And I was thrilled. My uncle got him a very high paying job. And I was like wow. Now it's my turn to look for good work so we can save up to buy a home. Just like my parents did. I'm so lucky. I ended up getting a really good paying job myself. And the problems started happening. Our liquor started disappearing. Our beer. And I would find them hidden in the most unusual places and not very well hid either so I was like ok weird but no biggy. Then he became very unreasonable. Constantly saying I was cheating. Lord knows I wouldn't cheat on that man. I'm not that kind of person. I deleted my social media. That didnt work. I cut off contact with my friends. That didnt work. I cut contact with family. That didnt work. To the point where I was just at home alone. And that was still not enough. I pleaded and bed him to believe me. My parents tried talking to him but he would not stop accusing me of cheating. I lived with the man. I answered every text immediately answered every call. He could look through my phone anytime he wanted. I lived with him and still that wasnt enough proof. The fighting and drinking got so bad my parents kicked him out. Our home is never a tense place where people fight. It's always calm and welcoming. He ended up losing his job. He would miss work or go there drunk. He would lie and say he was going to look for work at the union he was at and when I would ask him for proof he would get angry or text me he couldn't talk becuase he was at union or in a meeting. Lies and excuses why he couldn't find work. He would lie here and ther about having a job but no proof. Then he finally did get a job in October of last year and I was so happy and proud. Then things didnt add up. Then my snake got sick and need help giving him antibiotics and he would come to my house and help me and I thought it was so sweet of him to lose sleep because I didnt get home from work at midnight and he be up by 430am for work. He would sleep over and make up excuses like oh no work today, or oh half days today so I dont have to go to work til 12pm or what ever was convenient for him. I started getting fed up and I asked him to show me proof and he was good at dodging me for weeks and weeks.i was in complete denial. Finally we got into a heated arguement in January and he spilled the beans that he had been fired. I suspected him being fired since Novemeber. In March he told me he was getting evicted. And he was so stress out he couldn't find work becuase he need to look for a new home. Again things didnt add up. The house looked the same and no packing was done. I even got him boxes and begged him to let me help him to load off the stress. Well the eviction date came and went. Turns of the landlord decided to let them stay. And the landlord was no longer selling the house. Since then he still hasn't looked for work. I think this was just a lie to buy some time to not work. Two weeks ago He said his friend told him to come work at the airport with him. I was excited and supportive. And he found a way to twist and turn it to being my fault. I constantly find bottles in his home. When he is sober and hasn't drank in a while our relationship is great. But we hit another downfall. I am so hurt. I dont know what to do. Everything I do is wrong in his eyes. I cheat, I lie, I'm a horrible person according to him. I spend every day I dont work with him. I fought friends and my family over him. I lost friends. My family doesn't even invite me to events anymore becuae I dont show up. I isolated myself. I've put down my strong beliefs just to satisfy him. And still nothing is enough. Itll be his birthday in a couple of weeks and I been agonizing over the present. I spent this weekend working non stop on his present. That was a huge mistake. He cursed at me and broke up with me calls me just to tell me things and hang up. Then everything was ok but I had to go to work and then he goes again telling me horrible things. What do I do? Is there anything I can do? I feel so lost.",

            "selftext": "Been on and off dating a man. I don\u2019t drink or ever dated a man I drink so I am not sure if this counts as heavy drinking. Our few dates were at bars and he did not seem happy when I\u2019d suggest other places to go to. His dreams included buying his favorite bar and going brewery hopping. Alcohol is always in our discussions. I said I bought a dress for 50 usd, he\u2019s like that\u2019s my beer consumption for a week. I say I\u2019d love to go to Ireland. He said he\u2019d love to go to distillery tours.\n\nEver since he\u2019s known that I don\u2019t drink, he stopped hanging out in the weekends. He always asks me out during the week, because weekend is for \u201cdrinking and partying\u201d. A couple of times he texted me hungover and several times he flaked on me because he was so \u201ctired and sick and in bed\u201d, He mentioned twice that he\u2019d like \u201cto stop parting too hard and is quitting on this all and getting back to the healthy lifestyle.\u201d Only to mention his drinking plans again over the weekends. He\u2019s also sick and sniffing.\n\nI have been dismissing all of this as him not wanting a non-drinker around him. Until I saw him two weeks ago\u2014 he told me he lost his ID somewhere he can\u2019t remember. I said a bar? He said he does not even know. The problem was that he\u2019s not consumed with the ID loss as much as with the access to bars. He was asking what\u2019s the fastest way to get an ID to access them. No remorse or anything. Red flags? Or am I just overthinking?",

Days where I can't think. All my energy goes towards being human and functional at my full time job. I can't eat anything greasy. Nothing of substance. Not without never ending nausea. Bouts of intestinal exorsisms are a thing. I am over 6 months clean, but discovering that my shitty health wasn't caused by drinking (though is certainly didn't help). I'm mad that I can't do moderation like a normal person. No slice of cake and cocktail. No chips and pop while watching a movie. Just healthy food. And I'm not even skinny. The migraine medication I'm on is kind of known to make you hold on to weight. I'm frustrated. I just want to be a person. Not this fragile little friendless person who never goes out or me re eats in public. I am so tired. I just want to be good. Okay. Alive and living. Not just surviving. I keep getting ads for the drink I used to have nightly - nutrl vodka soda. Now in 2 new flavours! Ugh. Just enough to feel but not get drunk. I want one. I want that relaxing feeling after a long day. That little release in that first swig. I don't know if I can have one drink and not spiral back. I want to try but I also don't want to screw myself over. My relationship with my boyfriend is going very well. I am doing pretty well at work. But all my free time is spent being too tired to have fun. I just want a little bit of joy.",

I was fighting with a nasty eye infection (still dealing with the damage) and then I started to feel uncomfortable eating or drinking pretty much anything at all and a few days later I was so bloated that you could mistaken me as overdue pregnant. One rush to the hospital later the doctors quickly figured out that my liver suffered some damage and puked water all into my stomach cavity until it was pretty much filled to capacity.  \n\n\nAt this point they offered me a choice how to deal with the alcohol issue while I remained in the hospital to deal with the water problem. They will not force me to detox, so if I insist they can provide me with alcohol IV drips to keep withdrawal at bay. Or the second and more preferable option is to also do detox to prevent further damage to the liver; they can provide me with medication that helps dampen the withdrawal pains, but it will not be a pleasant experience.  \n\n\nI chose the latter as is obvious from the title.  \n\n\nAnd now, a week of pain and boredom later, here I am. Back home. With no desire to touch a beer again. It's a somewhat weird feeling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate: It's been a month since this and still dry. Somewhat. I slipped up twice when I decided to try a small glass of chili liquor and another time when I was relaxing on a sunny day and got a cold beer because I missed those cold beer on sunny days feeling. Both times could refrain from drinking more then that one drink though, so I still feel good about my sobriety chances",

He goes on for hours until he sobers up. Nothing in particular. Sometimes he gets ranty and will get overly aggressive about something or another. I just had to go upstairs for a bit simply to make it stop. But I can still hear him talking! To himself! I went down to grab something and he said \"I remember in 1982....\" I said politely that I need to go and watch a film, made a excuse about the snooker being on. I have told him about this when he's sober and he agrees. But then he gets drunk and here we go again. It's exhausting. Any tips on how to stop it without causing a massive argument? Just now I said I needed some space and he brought up the time I left him 6 years ago and ranted! Help!",

            "selftext": "Hi,\n\nI am completely new here. I struggle drinking too often and too much wine alone. It's now been 5 years. I am trying to hide this from my family but obviously they always know. I have 3 kids and I am married. Yesterday I drank almost 2 bottle of wine while others were watching TV. I sat in my office alone, pretended to be busy and work, but I kept drinking and drinking. I always hide my drink in the closet because I am shamed of the fact I have this problem and I cant stop. I also don't want my kids to see me drinking and to know about it. I mostly drink later in the evening when it's close to the time when kids sleep.\n\nMy husband tried to help me by finding a doctor whom I visited few time and I got the Revia bills. But I always find a way how to skip the medication and continue drinking. My husband is giving up on me and I think I will destroy everything I have because of this problem. I really hope I find a way to stop abusing alcohol.\n\nThank you",

            "selftext": "I think I might be experiencing DTs but I can\u2019t really find that much info about what I should be expecting but I feel really rough. My last drink was roughly 12 hours ago, I typically have a 6-pack a day occasionally more, have only had beer for last couple weeks. I have dried out before from heavier stuff and had very few side effects so this is scary.\n\nI started off okay, started to notice some shaking which has gotten progressively worse. If I lay down my trunk keeps lifting me up and my neck keeps jerking forward. I\u2019ve never had a seizure so it\u2019s alarming me quite a bit. Have had the shakes before but not to this extent. \n\nI have also completely and utterly cleared my guts out to the point I am just throwing up bile. I\u2019m not necessarily nauseous but several times I have gotten a very strong urge to just hurl and when I do it lasts for awhile and it hurts. I have not eaten for about 10 hours and have no desire to try, trying to drink water but I think it triggers the puking. I have anxiety from hell as it is but I have gotten to the point of hyperventilating several times tonight and my breathing is shallow even when I try to take a deep breath. It isn\u2019t helping.\n\nHas anyone experienced this? Does it sound like DTs? Like I said I\u2019ve been trying to find info but I didn\u2019t realize it was actually this bad and I\u2019m thrown off because it was just beer and I\u2019ve drank much heavier before. My mom died a month ago from problems related to alcohol and it was very sudden and if she knew she was sick she never told anybody, and she would be disappointed if I did the same thing. I am a 24 year old female, average height and weight. I know I should probably see a doctor but I am broke and uninsured and honestly just scared. Thank you for reading my post I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s long.",

I've had so many day 1s. Recently I've had a huge wake up call as I've developed a yellow spot on my eye.\n\nI'm 30 recently and have always been a bar fly. About 9 months ago my GF and I tried to go keto and switched from beer to clear alcohol. And since then the both of us have gone off the rails and honestly drink at least a half handle if not more a night between us. \n\nWhere do I turn for help? I'm telling myself that I'll cut back again, but I know without support I'll be drinking again tomorrow. And my gf is in denial also, but doesn't have the clear and present symptoms of liver damage that I do.\n\nI also don't currently have health insurance, though hope to soon get some through my work. Where do I begin the journey of trying preserve my life? \n\nThank you for any advice, because short of quiting my job and endangering my 4 year relationship by going to rehab I don't know how to find help.",

Triple date sort of thing. With this being a first date in a group I\u2019m a bit anxious as far as it leading to sex because of my sobriety I fear performance and nervous issues. Tho I doubt it will happen. Also not a fan of woman who put out on the first date. The thought of being in public already gives me a panic attack. I suffer from terrible anxiety. Back to the story I felt like I needed to drink the other day and to have a mellow week and prep myself. Just knowing I had the bottle made my heart race. Today I opened the bottle &amp; flushed it down the toilet. I\u2019m posting on here to vent. I will attend the meeting on Saturday and not drink. If I\u2019m not liked or made fun of for not drinking... fuck it. It\u2019s just a few hours spent with people I never have to interact with again. I woke up this morning feeling like my usual anxiety / panic shit self but I took a big sober breathe and it felt better than what liquor could ever do for me. 304 days sober. I\u2019m 30 and am about to get a year . The longest I\u2019ve had since I was 21.  I\u2019m still young. I can still escape this monster. I\u2019m doing this for my friends, family, my mother especially, and most importantly myself. I\u2019m a bit out of it as I haven\u2019t slept well since the other day. Just here to vent.

My dad is 67 years, retired and has been a daily drinker (2-3 beers) for years now but started drinking heavier these last couple years, even prior to retirement The family had an intervention about 3 months ago while he was still living in his own home with my mother. Unfortunately after almost 3 hours trying persuade him to check into a center for help we were unable to. After about 3 weeks he got drunk again. Fast forward to a couple weeks ago and couple more incidents including ending up in the hospital with a bruises and a cut near his eye after apparently falling, my mother told him to leave the house. He is now living with me. Its just my 16 year old son and me. The plan was to stay with me and start a program or start attending AA meetings which he has not and I also told him should he drink while living with me, I would have to ask him to leave the house. Well after just about 10 days, he is drunk in my living room. I can't talk to him now for obvious reasons. Here is my plan, he just to renovate a neighbor's laundry room a couple days ago. Tomorrow I plan to talk him and tell him that he will have get help starting tomorrow or he will have to go once he is done with the renovation. \n\nI have tried to find some help for him on my own but can't seem get any specific information on where get started. \n\nIf anyone reading this can direct me to a center, a telephone or someone I can ask I would really appreciate it.\n\nI live in South East section of Los Angeles by the 710 and 5 freeway.",

            "selftext": "Hi, this topic might have appeared here before. I have a friend who is an alcoholic. He is in his early 50's always drank, great guy, great at his job and as far as I know the drinking never got in the way of him doing a great job. He came to visit and I notice the drinking has increased. Vodka OJs for breakfest, asking to quickly stop at a bar in the middle of a city tour and so on. I noticed 1 bottle of vodka per day. I don't know the average but sounds too much. He holds his shit together during the day but for 2 evenings I had to put him in bed as he was stumbling and making inconvinient jokes, disturbing other guests. \n\nNow, he knows he has a problem. But what can I do to help? We don't live nearby. I didn't say anything directly when he was visiting, barely touched the subject and he said he drinks more when he is on vacation. Left it at that. \n\nI want to help him. No woman likes to stick around someone that is drunk almost everyday except the other occasional drunk who only piles up the problem. I think he feels lonely. Never married, no kids. \n\nShould I write him an email? Explain my concerns? Offer help? I know other people here are going through similar issues, so I would like to ask what would you have liked to hear? What would make a difference? \n\nSorry if the post is not super appropriate, I haven't read this subredit before, I just had this idea about asking theses questions here. I really don't know what to do.",

I drink probably average to excessive for someone my age, and have been probably since the age of 20...I have never had any heart related issues in my life and any crazy hangovers have always just been that, headache, lightheaded, tired, dehydrated, some shortness of breath etc...\n\nThe last 2 weeks or so where I live the summer weather is here and of course everyone gets out and about and hits it hard after a long ass winter...I basically went 4-5 nights in a row going too hard and probably drink the most I ever have, essentially binge drinking ...also smoking a little...\n\nCome the day after this bender where I decided to lay off and clean up (Sunday) I noticed a pain/sensation in my chest (left side) and the best way I can describe it is that my heart felt \"weak\" I also noticed throughout the day while talking to people, I had shortness of breath (having to take deep breaths all the way in).  I shrugged it off as being hungover/tired/dehydrated and chilled out that night, next day (Monday) I awoke at 6am to a constant pain in my chest with that same sensation and some shortness of breath as I got up and went about the morning...I had coffee, drank a ton of water, ate something, and went about my day to just this constant heaviness/pressure/pain basically in my heart or very near it, and shortness of breath all day...it got to a point in the afternoon where I started to somewhat have some concern medically as folks usually do when it comes to their chest/heart....I started googling and of course every sign pointed to heart attack...I debated with myself for about an hour what to do, and I decided that I was going to take myself to the ER because your heart is nothing to play around with...I started having a mild panic attack once I made the decision to go as it became somewhat surreal.\n\nFast fowardard, ER, doc, CT scan for blockage etc...no heart attack, no signs of one, no blockage, heart operating normally, they IV'd me, said they weren't sure what it was but it was nothing serious, and to rest, hydrate, and take it easy on the alcohol. \n\nThe next 2 days I did just that and started to feel better by the second day, however still had slight sensations/pain and some breathing issues...me being stupid, thursday night, I went to a get together and it turned into a deal and drank way too much...the next day friday was the worst shortness of breath, pain, hangover I have ever had...\n\nSaturday and sunday (today) I have taken it easy, hydrated, tried to sleep best I can as I have pretty much decided to quit the alcohol for awhile because this has been a wake up call....however I slept absolutely terrible last night and awoke at 2am to a mild panic attack that lasted for maybe 20 minutes...my heart/chest still has that pressure/pain sensation, shortness of breath comes and goes however is worse in the mornings...and I have slight pain in my shoulder, left arm, armpit areas etc...\n\n\nI have done a ton of research (good and bad) and have results that this is just typical heavy alcohol withdrawal symptoms as my blood pressure is high, heart rate maybe up? lack of sleep, anxiety all coming back full force and I just need to ride it out for a week and all will be good.\n\nHowever I also have seen sites/medical issues while I am googling phrases like \"heart pain\" \"shortness of breath\" \"arm/shoulder pain\" etc etc...and there are multitude of extremely bad medical cases such as angina, heart attack, artrial fibrillation, coronary heart disease, heart failure etc etc...angina and heart attack seem to happen randomly and within 15 minute window, so those are the least of the possibilities as this is somewhat of a constant deal...\n\n\nIt has only been 2 full nights since my last go around and I'm going to ride it out for 2 more as I have to fly to the east cost wednesday early morning, I absolutely HATE flying and it triggers all kind of anxiety the week leading up to the flight and I am semi-worried this is something serious and the last thing I want to have is to get on a plane and have some anxiety attack/heart attack/panic and shortness of breath etc...and I can't really bail on these flights unless obviously there's something serious happening here...\n\n\nThis has been a huge wake-up call for me and I am only 27 years old and would hate to think that I have done some irreversible damage to my heart and/or brought on a slow death of coronary heart disease or failure...I am hoping that these are not super typical but semi-typical symptoms of a binge/heavy drinking couple of weeks that need at least a week or more to clean out. \n\n\nAny advice would be great, thanks.",

He goes through DT's by himself in his apartment every month when he runs out of money and refuses to go to the hospital.  He used to work in the detox clinic here so he also refuses to go there. He has been told he will die if he keeps it up since he has liver cirrhosis.  If at any point you call him and start saying he needs help or ask him what he needs he just hangs up.  He's been admitted to the hospital with stage 4 hepatic encephelopathy a few months ago so If he does keep this up he really will die. I just don't understand.. He doesn't even drink for fun he sits there and watches his plants grow.  How can I help a person who doesn't want help?",

I want to say shes the one who encourages going to the bar but I will not. I want to say I do not have a problem but I wont do that either.. I take full responsibility of my actions and I have made the decision to stop drinking and to seek help.\n\n\n\n * Now, I want to talk about my gf.. We have been together for a little over three years. I moved across the country to be with her and to finish school. I am dependent on her to help with rent.\n\n\n\n * We have been drinking heavily almost every single day for almost a year but the last 4-5 months have been out of control. I don\u2019t want to get into details but when we drink we get into big arguments. When we fight it lasts a few days sometimes weeks.  The last month has been rough and toxic. We have not been intimate and have been sleeping in separate rooms some nights. A few days ago we got into a huge fight where I was convinced our relationship was over. It was because she thought I was emotionally cheating. We were both drunk and I was trying to prove to her I am a loyal partner. After the fight had escalated to a point where I felt I had not choice, I decided to call her mom.\n\n * I told her mom about the drinking problems. How she needed help and I needed help to make the drinking stop. My Gf was and still is LIVID that I did that. I feel as if it wasn\u2019t the best choice to do. But honestly, we have tried to quit drinking so so many times and we couldn\u2019t. I\u2019ve asked her to get professional help with me but she refuses. I\u2019m hoping if I can\u2019t convince her than maybe her family will.. My gf says I had no right, I damaged the relationship she has with her family and what I did was unforgivable. Am I in the wrong? I don\u2019t mind being in the wrong, I just want to know the right way to fix this. I want to be with her. I want this relationship to last forever. I want us to be sober again. She refuses to seek help and I know I can not force her. She has to want the help. \n\n * Right now I am scheduled to go to AA myself as well as Al-Anon next Sunday. \nWe both have not had alcohol in two days and we are both happy.. but I\u2019m not sure how long this sobriety will last for her.\n\nThank you for reading if you got this far..\n\nTLDR:  I struggle with drinking but seeking help. I told my Gfs family about the issues and asked for help. My Gf is pissed beyond words and refuses to seek professional help. What can I do?",

Last Thursday we split up and he told me that he is not a good man and that I deserve better. Of course I'm not perfect and I made some mistakes in the relationship but I'm wondering if this is just a cop-out or if this is how he really thinks of himself because he is an alcoholic.\n\nI asked him if he was doing this because he didn't love me anymore and he said no, I'm doing this because I do love you and I am not a good man and you deserve better. Is it just that he does not want to be with me or does he really think this? He knows that I have been affected badly by his alcoholism and I am wondering if this is just an excuse to get out of the relationship or if this is part of the self-loathing that they go through.\n\nI know that he is trying to change The Narrative of the break up into my expectations and needs but I know that it is his inability to help himself. I don't think that he is ready to stop and so he is telling me that he would rather drink and that he is not willing to put in the effort that it takes for a relationship to work. I am struggling with trying to figure out what it is about me that he doesn't think is valuable enough to want to step up and put in the effort. I keep thinking that he will be willing to put in the effort for someone else so maybe it was something about me.\n\nIs this just really about him not being ready to quit or is it something about me that he is not wanting to put in the effort for? I'm struggling to make sense of all of this. Any advice would be appreciated.",

            "selftext": "TLDR at the bottom.\n\nOk so I'm writing this text on this sub because I'm honestly needing help. I feel like I am silently battling a demon and I can't reach out to anyone.\n\nSB = step brother\nSS= step sister\n\nSuccinct backstory: Grew up in a family of 4 kids, I was the youngest. My 2 oldest siblings were \"step\" though I haven't ever thought of them that way because they have been in my life since I was 2. 15 years ago, my \"step siblings\" suffered a loss of their half sibling during a house fire, their half sister was only 4. My SB harldy ever talks about the incident but my SS took it very very hard. She has been an alcoholic ever since.\n\nI have been involved in multiple attempts to get her into treatment, multiple tear-filled meetings with my family, multiple \"I just don't know what to do anymore\" phone calls. All the while, I feel I have created an unhealthy coping mechanism with alcohol myself.\n\nI drink (almost) everyday. The days I don't it's only because I'm on my short-lived \"I'm gonna change\" bends. This has been progressively getting worse over the past 2 years to the point where I lay awake at night thinking to myself \"I have a problem\". NOBODY in my family knows, my husband just thinks I like beer (he doesn't know how much I ACTUALLY drink) and I'm very scared to reach out to someone for several reasons\n\n1. I feel like a hypocrit, given my sister's situation.\n2. I feel as though I will \"out\" myself and will make the hypothetical problem turn into a real problem\n3. I've suffered from Rx addiction in the past, and am nervous others will see this as a sign of me not having conquered it\n\nInpatient help is most likely not an option at this point. I suppose I label myself as a \"functioning alcoholic\" but I know, from having a sister who's afflicted, how quickly this could go south. \n\nKind words, insights, encouragement, brutal honesty. Anything. I'm asking for anything at this point because I am dealing with these fears all by myself.\n\nTLDR: Sister has been an alcoholic for 15 years, I feel I am starting to become way to dependant on alcohol and feel like a hypocrit. No body knows.",

Sober for 2 days. I've taken 15 mg of oxycodone both days. I feel fine. I have no desire to drink. I don't feel like I'm experiencing bad withdrawal symptoms at all. Just a little depression. From what I've read online. I should be experiencing bad withdrawal symptoms. I'm not going to trade opiates for alcohol. I don't have anymore and couldn't get more if I tried. I'm just worried that the opiate affect will wear off while I'm sleeping tonight and cause dangerous withdrawal symptoms. Just curious if anyone has done this. Am I not experiencing withdrawals or is it just the oxycodone masking the symptoms? I've also taken tumeric, milk thistle, magnesium, potassium,vitamin c, 2 multi vitamins. I ate really well today and I've drank a lot of pomegranate juice, water and a fruit smoothie. I have 2 shots I could drink if I need to taper off. I also have 3 Valiums I'm trying to hold on too if I need them tomorrow. Im Really motivated to quit. I just can't find any info about opiates helping with alcohol detox...",

            "selftext": "Hi my name is Dakota, I'm 18 years old and I'm transitioning from male to female both socially and physically, hence I'm set to start HRT very shortly. I know that both alcohol and estrogens are hepatotoxic, so I'm trying to kick my habit of binge drinking, or decrease how often i drink at the very least. However, I'm starting to worry that I've already done far too much damage to both my liver and my body at this point, I think that i have symptoms of alcoholic polyneuropathy, my arms and leg are constantly tingling, I'm always sweating excessively, I feel weaker than usual, and I've had both myalgia and arthralgia for the past year, but I'm also worried that this is all in my head, because I'm not only a hypochondriac, but I only developed my drinking habits around age 15, and I'm starting to question whether or not that would be long enough to do significant damage, at my worst point: i would drink between six and 12 shots a day, nearly every day, but I was only that bad for a period of about 5 months, ever since then, I've managed to decrease that to 1 or 2 shots a day, about every other day of every other week (so about 6 to 8 times a month), with the occasional exception of a celebratory event of some sort, but i only started to experience a lot of these symptoms around the time that i turned 18, which was August of last year. Should I seek out help right now? Or is it already too late for me to choose when I seek help? My liver vitals are going to be taken this May, and I know that they're going to deny me the prescription for estrogen if my liver isn't healthy enough to take it long-term, is there anything I can do? I've heard that milk thistle is good for boosting liver function, but I've also come to realize that about 90% of herbal supplements are snake oil salesman-type scams, should I say anything about my former habits? I really can't stay physically like this forever, so if i do have to choose between my physical health and my mental health, I'm going to choose my mental health, because i can't fix anything that's wrong with me physically, but as long as I'm dysphoric, there's a high chance that I'll eventually turn to self harm, in order to feel as though I'm in control of my body.",

Somewhere in the range of 15 to 20 units a day.\n\nA few days ago I didn\u2019t drink for a day. On the second day I had strong feelings of depression, I was tearful, had racing thoughts, depersonalization, and an uncomfortable \u201cthrumming\u201d sensation in my body. That was yesterday. I lapsed, but I did not drink today.\n\nI\u2019ve quit drinking CT before. Same thing. Drunk almost all day, every day. Back then though I didn\u2019t drink during my shift. I loaded up before, and got drinks after I finished. That went on for two years. When I quit tmy symptoms were insomnia, anxiety, DP/DR, elevated heart rate, and an enhanced sense of smell (which I\u2019ve read is a symptom of GABAergic drug withdrawl.)\n\nIm wondering if you all think this is a safe level of alcohol to CT?",

            "selftext": "Hello fellow alcoholics.\nAs my title has stated, I\u2019ve decided to drink again. Tonight in fact... well currently I\u2019ve started drinking a vodka tonic. \nAnyways, I\u2019m on my 3rd step with my sponsor - I was previously sober for 40 days, today being my 41st day. I\u2019ve had a REALLY low week this week. My depression has been super intense since I found out I need an exemption to work at my job. \nA little bit of background- I had a wet and reckless back in 2015 and had to take classes and complete 3 years of \u201cprobation\u201d... I didnt have a probation officer or anything, it was just a condition for maintaining my license. I must always be insured when driving. That lasted for 3 years and ended in July of 2018.\nAnyways, I had no idea that would effect me being hired when I accepted the job offer working in the office of a care home - so now I\u2019m in the process of obtaining an exemption.\nWell with that exception I had to obtain 3 character references and I asked my sponsor to complete one of them for me. She did. \nWell, what I haven\u2019t been telling her is that for the past week - I\u2019ve been really thinking that I want to drink again.. idk if it\u2019s just for tonight or if I want to continue more after.. but I\u2019ve been reconsidering because I\u2019m not 100% willing to give my will and life over to my higher power... just yet.. \nso, now I was thinking of telling my sponsor before I drank.. but I didn\u2019t want to be talked out of it, because I felt like that would lead to a resentment.. \n\nSo here I am.. drinking.. asking for advice on how to tell my sponsor (and friends) that I failed.. once again.",

My first semester GPA was a 4.7 (All A's in 5 AP classes), and as soon as second semester started, it dropped to C's because I come into school drunk as fuck. I am so addicted to drinking that I have to go ditch class and go to the bathroom and drink. I just love the taste. I've gotten threatened to be kicked out of high school last week because of being drunk. I definitely don't want to lose being rescinded from the ivy league school I got into, and now I'm facing serious consequences. I know I've let myself get out of hand, from the kid who got straight A's, teachers loved me, several awards, etc. to a wild party animal that just wants to skip school and drink and party all day. Idk what's wrong with me, and if I attend Penn next year with this mindset I'll be so fucked. Please help?",

The doctors said that that was very close to happening, but she actually just had a lot of fluid built up in her stomach that needed draining, and had really bad jaundice. My mother was a very heavy drinker. Ever since I was a kid I just remember her sitting on the couch every night sipping her vodka soda. Since she was discharged she was strictly told NOT to drink, they said if she continued to drink her liver would definitely start to fail and basically lead to death. She\u2019s been on unemployment, which ran out and she can\u2019t go on disability and she can\u2019t find anybody to hire her. She\u2019s still in pain every day and lies to me about not drinking, which really just makes me mad because i have to hear about how the pain isn\u2019t going away all while she\u2019s not doing anything to make herself healthier. Sorry for dragging that on.. I guess I needed to get that off my chest. My aunt wants to have an intervention for her, and asked me to get evidence of her drinking which I have on my phone (bottle under her bed). I love my mom but I haven\u2019t confronted her myself that I know.. and I\u2019m just not sure if it\u2019d be better if I did it before the whole family gets involved?

I've had very low self esteem since I was a child. I have really horrible social anxiety. I went through a really bad break-up about 18 months ago. We were together 6 years and he basically just stopped talking to me immediately after breaking up. Since then, I feel no reason to take care of myself. I don't feel worthy of anyone who would be stupid enough to date me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a fat drunk with a shitty job, but it pays well. I'm completely lost and broken.

            "selftext": "I decided not to drink any alcohol this weekend. I have been drinking pretty much every wknd for about 5 years. I never drank to get drunk. Anywhere between 3-4 glasses of wine 2 to 3 nights a week. So I have never been a heavy drinker or an every day drinker. \n\nIn the last year, I had started not liking many things. That first sip of wine not hitting my stomach right. Nothing intense. Just that yucky feeling when it first hits. But I powered thru and after that initial yuck, I was fine. I had always woken up a few times during the night every night that I consumed wine. Alcohol puts me to sleep fast but interrupts my sleep about 4 hours later. Dry mouth. That yucky sort of burning feeling in my stomach. Still a little buzzed and when coupled with waking up from sleep, it's not a good feeling. The run down tiredness feeling the next day. Sometimes headaches. I have finally reached the point of being very tired of alcohol. I made a choice to actively start listening to what my body is telling me about alcohol while I was consuming it. It really makes you realize that our bodies really do see alcohol as poison. It can be subtle, but it is there. \n\nSo, today when I woke up, after getting a full night of uniterputed sleep, it feels wonderful. I didn't drink last night. I always drank on Thursday nights after work.  (I have off on Fridays and Saturdays. ) Absolutely no plans on drinking tonight. I feel so good about this decision. My day is much brighter. I have not made a decision yet if I am quitting for good or just keep it to a once a month event. I have never considered myself an alcoholic per say. I feel like it's just a bad habit that I got myself into. I never really drank until I was 46 yrs old (Am 53 now). I was in a bad relationship with an alcoholic 4 yrs ago and that's how I got started into drinking more frequently. I kept it up after that relationship, not really thinking about it. \n\nSo, I made the decision to actively listen to my body. It tells us things. Good luck to all of you on your own journey thru this.",

I haven\u2019t had any dreams like this since I started (none that I can remember anyway) but damn. That was really weird. \n\nLike in the dream it was a night in an old school house (?) where all of my friends (even ones who have since moved far away or who have passed away) were all partying and saying \u201cit\u2019s just one night!\u201d And they had Bushmills (my fav). What\u2019s weird to me is that in my dream, it was all happy fun sparkle time and the dream whisky \u2018tasted\u2019 good, but like throughout the entire dream there was a small part of my brain going \u201cum no....gag... gross.... no... false....\u201d. It was like I was on the brink of lucid dreaming to even stop myself drinking in the dream (I still drank in the dream)  because I still remembered why I stopped in the first place. Idk. It was weird. \n\nI\u2019m waking up and processing it and for some reason felt the need to write about it (on reddit? Lol my sobriety journal is within arms reach too. Wth). Anyway. Not much else to say and not expecting any comments in return. But hey, DREAMS ARE WEIRD.",

I stretched out my stay at some places and omitted a few jobs that I only made it a week or two, then I used that new resume to apply literally anywhere and everywhere that I could get to. After a whole day of applying to jobs that I never would have in the past, I got a call back from a sales job (hourly with commission), even though I have exactly 0 experience. When I finally got the interview and the big question came up (about an 8 month employment gap) I said I had family issues and no further questions were asked about it. The rest of it was smooth sailing. I start on Monday! I couldn't be more excited. And I've got another interview today for a part-time position as a dishwasher and prep cook that will work with the other jobs hours if I get it. Thanks to everyone who responded with stories and encouragement. But special thanks to those two. Knowing that I wasn't alone and seeing how other people handled the same situation really gave me clarity and certainty that I would make it. Have a great day everyone.",

And, this became my new vice. I have an anxiety disorder. It existed before any of this. I even take Prozac and drink with it. I've known I've been addicted for years. I just don't ever mention it to my doctor. I've tried quitting. I even want to go back to weed instead, but I just keep telling myself this is legal and fine.\n\nBut, I know it's not. My dad died around 40 from it. I was abused from it. Lived with it. Now I'm no better then him..and, I hate it. I just wish the nightmare was over. But, I enjoy nothing more then coming home after a long day of work to drink and play video games.",

This past week I\u2019ve probably drank average 4 drinks every day, some days less some days more. Today is my first day not drinking after the week and I\u2019m feeling like shit. Mild constant anxiety, clammy, just overall feeling weird. I\u2019m wondering if this is enough to send me into withdrawals or even into the danger zone. I\u2019m wanting to drink less but the stress of school has got me finding myself wanting to drink more. But right now I\u2019m just worried about withdrawals especially the danger associated with that. I\u2019ve also slept awful this past week and have only been getting around 6 hours of sleep a night so idk if that has something to do with how I\u2019m feeling as well.\n\nTl;dr: normally drink 3 drinks 4 nights out of the week. Been drinking 5 drinks every night for the past week. Feeling bad today. Worried about dangerous withdrawal.",

I didn\u2019t touch any of the beer in my fridge (for tapering) as I really hate beer and see it as pointless. It\u2019s just PBR ugh.  But I did start on my dr prescribed benzo regimen and started back on the many pills for my high bloood pressure. I had stopped taking them regularly so I could drink. \n\nI didn\u2019t sneak away to buy a bottle! My boyfriend commented that I smelled like vodka but it was definitely from the night before. We made a nice dinner although I couldn\u2019t eat much, made popcorn and tea, and watched movies. \n\nThere were a couple times that I had to get up and just pace around my apartment but all in all, I think I did ok. Usually, around bedtime, I lay there and stare at my phone unable to sleep. I could barely keep my eyes open and slept better than I have in a long time. Aside from the multiple bathroom trips, and sweating. \n\nToday has been a little different. I woke up with a sense of dread and fear of a seizure. Lots of muscle twitching when I tried dozing off. I called my dr and he said to continue what I\u2019m doing (med-wise) and to also have one nasty ass PBR. NO LIQUOR! I\u2019ve yet to crack it open and I probably won\u2019t. \n\nIt\u2019s almost 2 am and I\u2019m going to get off my ass, stop worrying about what could happen, and get my mind busy. \n\nI just want to get through the next couple of days. \n\nThanks to all who responded yesterday. Y\u2019all are amazing.",

I'm wondering if anyone who has been in a similar position can share their story about what it was like to put the pieces back together? How did you find your first job? How long did it take? Were you honest about your work history and employment gap? Anything you can share will be helpful and motivating for me. Thanks everyone!",

He has also had sleeping problems due to the anxiety and drinks to go to sleep. He drinks wine to go to bed every night; sometimes he\u2019ll have 3-4 beers in addition, but he never seems drunk or even buzzed.\n\nHe\u2019s starting to realize he may have a problem, even though it seems \u201csmall\u201d compared to others. He admitted that while most of it comes from sleep, it does come from numbing the existential dread he feels. I really want to try and help but he thinks it may create a weird dynamic in our relationship. I\u2019m just scared. I don\u2019t want to sound selfish because I know he needs me and I would never abandon him, but I don\u2019t know what to do or how to help. I feel very alone because I can\u2019t talk to him about it, but I don\u2019t want to tell my friends or family because I don\u2019t want them to think differently of him.

My siblings and I did not really realize the severity of his addiction until we were old enough to understand. We are all in our mid 20's and early 30's at this point, and it has really become a big issue for us recently.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom has revealed to us that he's always been this way, and that she's really never been happy because of it. My parents don't hang out or do anything together, and have their own separate interests/friends. I guess it's just crushing all of us kids because we grew up thinking that our family \"had it all together.\" All of us are very successful thus far... two of us (including me) run our own businesses, and have always been the top performing individuals in anything we've worked at. I'm not trying to make it sound as if our family is better than anyone else's (because we're definitely not), but it's just really hard for us to grasp it all since we were raised thinking we had a solid foundation. How did we all make it so far when this problem was right under our nose all this time?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn top of that, my wife's father took his own life as an alcoholic last year. He was a very successful entrepreneur and provided for countless people...but somehow succumbed to the same addictive disease that inflicts millions of people. It really seems to us like almost all middle-aged men have an issue with alcohol consumption. Honestly, I'm terrified of ending up the same way, as I work in a high-stress environment (I like the drink here and there, but try and remember the dangers as to not get carried away). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mother and siblings want to have an intervention with my dad, and I agree we need to say something. My father is drinking a box of wine every day (plus liquor as a supplement). We want to approach this carefully as we don't want him to retaliate.. but at this point he won't make it past 60 years if he stays on this track (he's already jaundice, and has the shakes in the morning). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you guys think? How do we approach this conversation? We love him so much, and honestly he's such an amazing person...he just can't set the drink down. Do we push him to go to rehab? He's going to be so hurt that we feel this way, but it was self-inflicted and we just want him to be around to watch his grandchildren grow up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you all think?

To this day, it was the most spiritual and eye-opening experience of my life. The best way I can describe what alcohol does for me is that the difference between being sober and being drunk is the difference between someone telling you about a show and actually watching that show. I won't bore you with my whole life story, but suffice it to say that, since then, I've been trying to watch that show. No other drug I've tried has come close to alcohol in terms of filling whatever void there is in me. Unfortunately for me, alcohol also makes me an \"asshole\" according to my friends and family. I'm the least physically violent guy in the world, and I've never laid hands on anyone because of alcohol. That being said, I will admit that I'm an emotional powder-keg when I'm drinking and that I've been an awful prick to my loved ones for no good reason. But none of that matters. Everything I do in life is a calculated effort towards getting drunk. Without that singular goal, I have no real reason to keep going. I've quit before and gone through all the withdrawals and DTs and shit, but being sober is absolutely miserable. I don't want anything to do with my family or my old friends (whom I've not seen in three years) when I'm sober. The only tolerable thing about being sober is that I know I won't have to be forever. What the hell am I supposed to do? I'd seriously rather be homeless, friendless and estranged from my family than commit to the horror of prolonged sobriety...",

It's my own fault of course, but I didn't know they'd be so prompt.\n\nThe group was 11 people, 3 support workers and a nurse. All ages, but there were slightly more men.\n\nIt started with the typical introduce yourself, describe the problems you've been having in terms of what you drink and how much, and what you want to achieve.\n\nThen we did a group exercise where we were asked what we think what alcohol is.\n\nWe moved into a group drawing exercise where we drew the human body and all the parts of it which can be affected by alcohol. There were two groups, one drew a man and the other a woman, and we explored how alcohol affects different genders differently.\n\nAfter a break we discussed alcohol withdrawal, what symptoms to look for, and what to do if you experience them. I won't lie, this bit scared the shit out of me. One of the support workers had 'been there', so to speak, even to the point of seizures.\n\nIn the last half of this session I had started having withdrawal symptoms myself. No one said anything but I'm sure it was obvious.\n\nSeven more weeks to go!",

If we go out to a comedy club, he has to bring a coke and scotch with him for the ride there(I drive sober 100%) and while there he'll have 3 or 4 scotch and cokes. \n\nHe pays all of his bills on time so I'm not worried on that front.

            "selftext": "Alright everyone... I\u2019ve posted here before. I\u2019ve also not put a lot of effort into stopping. All talk, no action. \n\nIt\u2019s come to the point where I need to do this for the one relationship that I have left. And it hasn\u2019t been a healthy relationship either. In fact, it\u2019s been drunk and violent (resulting in us both being arrested twice.)\n\nWell... the other night, after plenty of vodka and generally getting along... things got heated and he pushed me. I fell onto the arm of the couch face first. I\u2019ll make it short, I grabbed my purse and ran crying outside. There were police out there already (bad neighborhood). They stopped me to see why I was crying and my face was bleeding. I have a report, took pics, and let them inside the house. My partner had snuck out the back door. He was arrested the next morning at work. \n\nHe\u2019s out on bail. He is all that I have left. I know it\u2019s a toxic situation. \n\nBut, a condition of his bail, is that he has to check in 4 days a week for alcohol/drug testing. He\u2019s facing at least 10 more days in jail - up to 6 months. I truly believe this is a wake up call for him and that he really wants to stop. I know I sound like a Lifetime Television for Women movie, but we get along perfectly when we don\u2019t drink. I have seen others change and I believe he can do it too, if he wants. \n\nI have also been a violent drunk. Abusive. Destructive. \n\nWe\u2019ve never talked about quitting together. It was always me, I was the one that had to quit. And I drink twice as often as he does. As in every single day. He has a much easier time going days without. No withdrawals, he just sips his tea and eats ice cream. I get awful anxiety and the shakes, can\u2019t sleep, panic attacks. I pretty much think I\u2019m dying. \n\nI said I would stop too and that we could both get help and try to salvage this relationship. He knows I will have to taper. I don\u2019t have insurance and can\u2019t get into any rehabs anyway. They don\u2019t deem me \u201csick enough\u201d even though I can blow through a couple pints of vodka a day.  A detox center is 800 dollars a night. So tapering and Valium is the plan. I\u2019ve seen my dr (120 bucks a visit!) And this is all he could recommend. \n\nI said that I would quit with him. That I wanted to support him. And guess what I did yesterday morning (he\u2019d gotten out of jail the night before). While he was at the courthouse taking care of things, I got absolutely drunk off of what was left of the booze. We went to see Endgame and I tried lying that the reason that I smelled was from the night before. He then said, I can see that you have something in your bra... I had hidden the rest of the pint in my bra. \n\nI fucking fell asleep during the final battle scene.  A movie I\u2019ve been looking forward to forever. \n\nI\u2019m ashamed. This has to stop. I want my life back. I want my children to speak to me again. I want to have a steady job and steady hands. \n\nPlease don\u2019t lecture me about my relationship (too much). I may end up leaving him to work strictly on myself and so he can do the same. One step at a time though... and today is the day that I (hopefully) won\u2019t be passed out cold by 5pm. \n\nThanks for reading. This got longer than I expected.",

            "selftext": "So, like the title says. Mom's been a drinker for a while--never enough to get her in trouble, but I'd say she goes through a small bottle of wine almost every night. She's driven under the influence a few times, though usually if she's been drinking and wants more, I'll go to the store for her b/c I know she'll drive there herself otherwise. I hate enabling, yet I don't want her hurting herself or someone else.\n\nThing is, I'm 26. Been at home too long already. I'm looking for work (kind of a slog--why'd I major in English?) and will ideally be moving out within the next six months. I lived away from home briefly at one point and she didn't get worse per se, she just kinda... began wasting away, you know? Sat there in the house, falling asleep on the couch, alone and lonely, with no apparent interest in doing anything to help herself.\n\nI'm really worried that when I leave, she'll spiral down and lose herself entirely, having no one around to stop her. I have a younger sister, but she usually lives on campus, only stopping home occasionally. Despite our best efforts, she never stops drinking, despite admitting that she drinks too much. I hear that's the first step--doesn't seem to matter if she won't keep walking.\n\nI know I'm not responsible for her decisions, health, or happiness. Just my own. I know moving out is necessary to my own happiness b/c she gets weird, hostile, or outright insulting a lot of the time, especially about the fact that I'm trans (\"I don't like who you are now\" is really, *really* cutting for such a simple, even polite, jab.) In some respects, I get that my transition hasn't been the easiest thing, and maybe moving out will help her a bit in the same way.\n\nFor the most part, I've tried to shrug off her behavior and rationalize it as her coping with stress from work, even if in an unhealthy way, but I don't think I can keep doing that. It hit me last night how resentful I am of all this. I had an awful day at work yesterday, saw the open wine bottle, and debated pouring myself a glass, then got really angry at myself. I automatically thought, \"I will *not* become her.\" The idea came unbidden. Pure emotion and reaction. Guess it's nice to know I have a defense mechanism that'll keep me from using alcohol to cope, but... still.\n\nMoving out is clearly the next big step in my life, but I know that it'll haunt me if she winds up destroying herself. The risk of driving drunk is one thing. The risk of her simply dying in her sleep of some complication is far greater. She already has weight/breathing problems (she smokes, too) and I'm pretty sure some degree of sleep apnea. Liver damage wouldn't be surprising at all. \n\nI feel like I'm the foundation for my mom's last tenuous grasp at sobriety. It seems certain that my leaving will bring her life crumbling down around her.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice? Thoughts? Experience here? A job offer, if absolutely nothing else?",

            "selftext": "Backstory: My mom started drinking when I was around 15. Binge drinker. Went through it for a good nine or ten years, off and on. She'd get drunk, get violent. She lost marriages and friends. Eventually she got on pills to sleep. Jail time, hospital visits, etc. I'd need several days to explain everything, so I'm just keeping it brief. Over the course of this time, I always took care of her, blamed myself, family blamed me... I stopped living my life for several years because I was so consumed with the fallout from her addiction. Eventually, she got her 4th DUI and she went to prison for a while. I had limited contact with her in that time and she stopped drinking. Once she got out, we really repaired our relationship and she didn't drink for three years. Up until recently...  \n\n\nRecently, my mom was supposed to come down and visit me (I live in another city four hours away from her) and she never showed up. I was worried and had an awful feeling. A friend of hers contacts me and tells me that my mom was arrested for a DUI and for evading arrest. Friend is concerned and lets me know that my mom is not only drinking again, but that she picked my mom up on another occasion a few weeks before for running down a fence when she was drinking. Luckily, the cops had not come that time. But this last time, the cops did come and arrest my mom. My mom contacts me a day later, and is mad that I know about what happened. She says her friend is lying and tries to explain why she got arrested. She insists the cops have it out for her and she hasn't been drinking.  \n\n\nCut to today, another friend contacts me and says she's worried about my mom, that she's on the phone having a freakout. I try to console my mom when I do call, but she's drunk (again), and is crying that she's suicidal, doesn't have anyone, and that the only person she has is me and I'm the \"only thing she ever did right\". I tell her that I love her but that she needs to pull herself out of it. She starts getting more belligerent and angry. She still insists she isn't drinking and that she's just loopy from her sleeping meds.\n\n  \nWhat I think set her off: A few months ago she got fired from her job unjustly. She found another one and started dating this new guy. He's no good for her, but she doesn't see it that way. He keeps going back to his ex-wife, and it's been back and forth between my mom and that other lady.  I don't know if he's caused her relapse or what, but she was fine before this guy. Not that it's his fault; my mom is a grown ass woman who is responsible for her decisions.  \n\n\nShe will more than likely go back to prison for getting, yet again, another DUI. Until then, I'm just not sure how to handle this. It's been three years since I've dealt with any of this. I also have diagnosed PTSD over everything that happened in the past, so I can't have her here while she's still lying and in denial that she's drinking again. She says she isn't, but I'm certain she is. I can tell by her voice. I'm not going to enable her as I did in the past or put my life on hold for her. I know I can't make her stop. I know she's in control.  \n\n\nBut ultimately, how can I interact with her? If I try to talk to her about drinking, she tends to start drinking more and freaks out that I don't believe her. if I don't mention it, then she still calls me, drunk and messed up off her ass, and treats me like I'm stupid. I just care about her and love her (obviously) but I don't know how to interact with her in a way that doesn't harm me.  \n\n\nThank you &lt;3",

I\u2019ve just woken up in bed, on my own, fully dressed and I have no recollection of how I got here (for context I live with my SO and he\u2019s asleep in the other room on a pull out mattress). This definitely isn\u2019t the first time. It\u2019s happened twice last week.\n\nI\u2019ve been trying to piece together what happened. The last thing I remember is leaving work (I work in a pub) and all there was when I woke up was a text from my SO saying \u201cwe\u2019ll talk tomorrow\u201d.  I don\u2019t know what that means but I\u2019m terrified. The texts before that from him say \u201cdon\u2019t do this again\u201d (talking about staying out at the pub and getting back smashed). \n\nIt always starts out with the best of intentions. I work a lot and do fairly long hours so once I finish it\u2019s easy to convince myself that I deserve a drink after work. And I get on well with the people I work with and it\u2019s fun. But I can never just have one, I get smashed.\n\nAnd then I come home. That look of disappointment breaks my heart every time. But I don\u2019t know how to stop. I do it to cope.\n\nSometimes I\u2019m good. It depends on the day. If I wake up anxious and sad (which is becoming more often now) the only way I can face getting out the house is by swigging something or buying a can on my way to work. And usually on my day off I\u2019ll start drinking as soon as I possibly can.\n\nFor a long time I\u2019ve not accepted that I have a problem. My problem is too much work and long hours so it\u2019s fine if I drink. My problem is having a hard time with my mental health so it\u2019s fine if I drink. My problem is my SO so it\u2019s fine.\n\nI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing anymore. I\u2019m not sure if this is the right place to post or if this is the sort of thing people post. This is my first post on reddit so I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing with this either, ha! I\u2019m just lost and could use some advice.",

            "selftext": "So far, I think it\u2019s been almost three weeks since I was last really drunk and a month since I was drinking in public, before class, and at work(thankfully I\u2019ve never been caught). Even before that I used to drink tequila right from the bottle before all of my classes earlier in the semester and last semester I used to make regular trips to the liquor store as in two to three times a week and it was at a point where I almost couldn\u2019t do homework or edit videos without drinking. I\u2019ve been feeling the itch every now and again like when I go to meetings or when I hung out with my \u201cfriends\u201d(who I\u2019m sure really only wanted to keep me around because I was old enough to buy alcohol for them or get alcohol for them. The second I stopped getting alcohol for them they stopped calling or coming around, barely even speak to me on campus but whatever). I think I\u2019m doing pretty well though, from where I\u2019d be drunk 6 days out of the week and always feeling like I need a beer or two just to get through being around people to now where I\u2019ll occasionally have 1-2 beers with the guys from the office if they invite me out. I still get nervous sometimes though, like what if it gets too rough and I go back. I know I\u2019ve got my roommates to help me through it in case the water should ever get too high but I still get scared some nights. I know there are people here that really are suffering through this and I would never try to equate what I go through to them. I just get scared sometimes, like on a Saturday two weeks ago when I was first trying to get off I went to a party with my friends where there were people everywhere, like the streets were filled to the brim with people. There was beer everywhere, people had brought all these different types of alcohol, it was practically raining alcohol. Then there was an after party that night at one of their houses and everybody was drinking heavily(granted I shouldn\u2019t have went because I told them I wasn\u2019t trying to get drunk but I didn\u2019t want to sit at home by myself) and everybody was smoking. It felt like I was wrestling someone two weight classes over me, after about an hour I bolted. It\u2019s nights like that and the guilt/shame I felt from that night that keep me worried, but I know that the people I keep around me now(basically my roommates and my gym partner) are supportive of me and I owe them everything. I don\u2019t mean to take up anybody\u2019s time, I just needed a place to talk about this.",

            "selftext": "I started drinking when I was in my teens with friends  but it was not a regular thing. Later on I would start drinking often because I had just turned 21 and lived at a party house. Drinking daily was normal for a household of young guys who liked to party. Towards the end of 2016 I got a pretty nasty DUI. It scared me straight and I didn't touch alchohol for almost a year. Then once the dust settled I began to drink seldomly. Then I started drinking about once or twice a week, only to about a light buzz. Now a few years later I find myself drinking almost daily but not to the point I get smashed and have hangovers. I have great career and pay all my bills on time, none would be the wiser to my drinking habits from the outside.\n\n Am I considered a functioning alcoholic or am I just a ticking time bomb that's waiting to hit rock bottom?\n\nNot trying to glorify, brag or \"flex\", just honestly curious. Any and all replies are appreciated regardless of their nature.",

I drank a whole liter of 80% alcohol and threw up MUCH more than usual, it looked like coffee grounds. I was throwing up blood. This addiction, this habit, this problem I had, I couldn\u2019t admit until then. I was fucking killing myself. See I was fine with that, but my ex of 2 yrs was there and saw me was crying saying \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d as in, I don\u2019t understand why you do this to yourself. I had people that cared about me. \n\nIt clicked, I do this to myself. Im only 22 but Ive been seriously contemplating rehab if I lose it again. I know what I\u2019ll do though. Lock myself in a room for the next few days while my wrists feel like they\u2019re getting scraped by shovels from the withdrawal, I can already feel it. Sitting there feeling like death, wishing you had liquid courage to make life interesting again. \n\nI\u2019ve drank half of this 100% bottle of liquor and my fucking organs hurt, why the fuck do i do this to myself. All I know is I don\u2019t want the face my ex had to be on anyone ever again. I HAVE problem, but problems are fixable, and I KNOW I can fix this. I\u2019m gonna die at some point, but not like fucking this. \n\nMy dad was a severe alcoholic that cost him marriages, the house, and many other things. I won\u2019t fall into the sins of my father. I will look at this post when I think of relapsing and if anyone if anyone is reading this wanting to quit please please please do, it DOESNT make things better, but it gives you the CHANCE to make things better. Oh god i can feel the digging in my arms already, good luck to any fellow alcoholics trying to quit, sending my love your way.",

On average, it\u2019s about 6 times a month where I go pretty hard.\n\nLately though, after a weekend night, I\u2019ve had some pretty horrendous anxiety the next day / day and a half. I\u2019ve always had anxiety and take some meds for it, but it\u2019s been crippling these past few days. I last went out on Friday and have been an anxious/stressed mess since then (it\u2019s now Tuesday). I stopped drinking at about 4am Saturday morning, and around 6pm and I felt like I was having a panic attack near a crowd of people. Now, I feel like the inside of my body is buzzing constantly and I am always fatigued. Every now and then I\u2019ll have a random twitch, and I can feel the panic coming on (I immediately think withdrawal). My solution to make it go away is to work out or engage myself in video games or conversation. Once I\u2019m alone, it all comes back.\n\nI haven\u2019t sweat or had external tremors, and I can sleep normally for the most part (about 6-7 hrs a night). Last night though, I jolted awake from a normal dream to my shoulder shaking very hard for about 5 seconds. I felt the panic coming on and I wasn\u2019t pretty sure I was about to have a full blown seiZure. It went away pretty quickly  and I fell asleep shorty after.\n\nI\u2019ve been reading about magnesium deficiency as in heavy drinkers, and I wonder if this could be the main cause of this feeling. I plan to pick up some supplements today.\n\nI\u2019d like to hear that this is all anxiety, but I figured this is the best place to hear the truth of withdrawal experiences.",

            "selftext": "I just have some feelings I wanted to get off of my chest, and get some opinions from people who have experience with alcohol and alcoholism.\n\nSo I\u2019m 22yrs old, and I have been around booze pretty much all of my life because of my father. He\u2019s not a very good person for more reasons than I care to list, but I do think his alcoholism is a big part of why he is who he is. Growing up, I\u2019ve always had a disdain for alcohol because of how I\u2019ve gotten to associate it with him. I also know that alcohol addiction is a problem that spans generations, and that children of alcoholics are at high risk for developing it.\n\nThroughout adolescence, I never drank or even enjoyed alcohol, and planned not to drink because I don\u2019t want to be like my dad. After my 21st birthday however, I was in a few situations where people around me encouraged me to have a drink or two, and I eventually caved. I have always hated the taste of beer, and seeing how beer is my father\u2019s vice, I didn\u2019t want to develop a taste for it anyway. Wine tasted a little better, but gave me major headaches. So, hard liquor it was.\n\nOn one hand, I had horrible physical pain. I found that when I drank, I would almost immediately be hit with this debilitating pain in my back. I couldn\u2019t even sit up sometimes. In addition, I often experienced pain in my bladder.\n\nAlong with the pain however, I became acquainted with the buzzed, euphoric feeling that alcohol causes. And I liked that a lot. And I found that after I powered through the initial pain, it would subside, and all I\u2019d be left with was that buzz that alcohol is known for.\n\nAfter that, I started drinking more and more regularly, pacing myself and taking ibuprofen for my back and Azo for my urinary pain. Eventually, I stopped experiencing pain when I drank altogether.\n\nThis all led up to my current drinking habits, about a year and a half later. I only allow myself to drink on the weekends, but on the weekends I drink consistently and in large quantities. I will go through an entire bottle or at the very least the vast majority of a 750ml bottle of Crown Royal every week. I know that it\u2019s common for people in their early twenties to drink a lot, but I also know that it\u2019s a slippery slope to substance abuse.\n\nI\u2019ve struggled with mental illnesses throughout the majority of my life, and I\u2019ve discovered that alcohol provides their hold on me to be temporarily lifted. When I\u2019m drunk, I don\u2019t worry that people are staring at me, or judging me. When I\u2019m drunk, I don\u2019t stress out about my future. Everything doesn\u2019t feel pointless. Commitment doesn\u2019t terrify me. I\u2019m not constantly doubting myself. I actually feel like a normal person. \n\nIt scares me that alcohol has this effect on me, because it\u2019s easy to see myself becoming reliant on it in order to function when it seems like such a \u201cmiracle drug\u201d. It\u2019s quick reprieve from all these problems I\u2019ve struggled with for as far back as I can remember. I know that it isn\u2019t a real fix, and that drinking these problems away is simply trading those problems with another one. Yet, I still worry about becoming dependent. I worry that simply being aware of this isn\u2019t enough.\n\nFor the most part, it isn\u2019t hard for me to abstain from drinking during the week. If I\u2019m struggling, I might be tempted to drink, but I don\u2019t give in. It\u2019s not hard for me to go back to sobriety after drinking Friday and Saturday night. But those nights are more often than not the highlight of my week. I have the most fun when the week is over and I\u2019m able to pour myself a drink and play some video games poorly.\n\nHow much alcohol is too much? Am I becoming an addict? Do I already qualify as an addict? Should I be concerned?",

I know children have little control, and tend to try to take control where they shouldn't, but honestly I need advice.\n\nAs a child she lived with her mom and her sisters, they (her sisters) were always gone, and her mother was drunk almost everyday. She's bipolar and has back pain, those may also have something to do with it. My dad works a very low-paying job, and works 11-12 hours a day, leaving me alone with my mom who drinks now around 5 times a week.\n\nIt used to be almost everyday from the time I was 5 until the time I was 8 or 9. After that it slowed down to 3 or 4 times a week. She's been to rehab twice, neither had effective results, and was recently sober for a month at a time on 3 occassions, but immediately went back to drinking again.\n\nI was suspended for 3 months from school, and watched her all the time everyday to make sure nothing happened, and she was sober all but 4 days in that time. Now I'm back in school and the first 3 days she drank, after that she stopped that week but began again and it has happened 5 days a week for the past 3 weeks.\n\nIt always leads to fighting, my dad coming home late and seeing her like that, yelling, hitting, things broken, etc. I just want to have a normal (around) last quarter of my \"childhood\". She steals money from me and my dad, she lies about her issue, even saying the next day she's sober that we are \"Insane dickheads for accusing her of doing such a horrible thing.\"\n\nShe's a good mother, she really is, but I don't know how much longer any of us (Me, my brother, and my dad) can put up with her addiction. Is there any last-resort we should discuss trying, because my dad plans on kicking her out soon and I want to give her one last chance.",

I do not like alcohol, I've seen what it did to my late grandpa, I am aware of what it does to innocent people, and I see what it has done to my father. He is in denial even though he recently got arrested for DUI, and had been living in his friends garage for the last 5 years smashing cases of Keystone and Busch, chainsmoking, and eating once a day. He would hold a job for 6 months to a year, then would be on the hunt again. Recently he was offered the opportunity to move in with a family member and took it, moving away from a failed 15+yr relationship with a stepchild and my nieces for a \"fresh start\". Well, he got a DUI while moving. Knowing how I feel about booze and drinking and driving he has to audacity to call me at 2am and demand I come get him from jail(over an hour away), completely unapologetic to me with this blas\u00e9 attitude downplaying the severity of his charge and it associated dangers. Whatever. Since then it seemed like he was doing better, only had a beer or two here and there that we were aware of, found a job etc.. Long story short, this past weekend he showed up to work drunk(1.5 hours from home), got fired, and proceeded to walk off into the city. Family went to look for him, he turned his phone off or it died, and I am pretty sure had a missing persons filed by my family and his boss. He finally turned his phone on, someone went and picked him up and got him home, still had the same old blas\u00e9 attitude and still thinks he is in control of his drinking... We are at wits end, it is fucking with my emotions, and I am genuinely growing tired of being an adult dealing with this shit from my father. I want him to get help, I want my fucking Dad back, I am tired of worrying, and I am done bailing him out. \n\nMy main reason for coming here is to get that shit off my chest. I am too embarassed to speak to anyone I actually know, and they wouldn't be of any help any how. How can you convince someone they need help? If we do get through to him, he needs inpatient rehab. My family is talking about Trosa, but the program is extremely long(1+yr?) and contact is extremely limited from what I can tell. Idk, that is why I am here. I need advice. I don't expect a bunch of strangers to solve my problems for me, I just need an idea of where to start. Sorry if I offended anyone, thanks in advance for any suggestions. NC, USA if it matters.",

Do any of you who\u2019ve been sober for a long time (year or more) still sometimes get (or feel like you\u2019re getting) the taste/smell of alcohol on your breath, even though you know for a fact you\u2019ve not had a single drop?\n\nSometimes I do. Not all the time, only sometimes. Now that I think about it, it\u2019s usually late in the evening or after I\u2019ve eaten candy (I eat a lot of junk food). Is it akin to \u201cphantom limb\u201d? Anybody else know what I\u2019m talking about?",

            "selftext": "I am posting this on a throw away and I don't know if this is the right place, but I don't know were else to go.\n\nMy mom was/is an alcoholic. She is in all honesty a really great mom, she always supported me and my brothers and always did her best to watch us prosper and ways put our needs before those of hers.\n\nShe has always been very open about her alcoholism. She suffers from ptsd from traumatic events and often has waking nightmares about me or my brothers dying or being taken or unfindable. Growing up with her was well quite normal, I understood my mom and my dad and other family always supported her. \n\nOccasionally she relapses, it happened twice in the last eleven years. I was a teenager back then and while me and my brothers were at school and my dad at work she would start doing weird shopping trips, she has a bad leg and would never go for some small things like just some cola. Her purchases often were cheaper than money spent and my dad knew this. The final straw the first time was when she proudly showed two drinking glasses she bought while returning empty bottles from my brothers and I.  These glasses were not from the supermarket, they were from the liquor store next to it, because it had their brand, and they don't take empty bottles, We held an intervention, confronted her and she struggled but gained her footing after a while. She promised us to never drink again. \n\nSecond time happened last summer and that one scarred me a lot more, I came home from work, after a hot summer day and I could hear her shouting against my father, I parked got inside and witnessed her being all pissed off.\n While my dad is not an easy man, he was really really calm.  Turns out she drank a bottle of wine. A friend of mine who didn't know gifted it during a house visit. She screamed called me and my brothers names and just full on drunken banshee. When I asked one of my brothers what was going on he just said: \"She drank\". That broke my heart, I never felt so much emotional pain at once. Meanwhile my mom was still raging about how bad her life was and how she gave me and my brothers everything. I gained some composure and tried reasoning, I told her she should leave the wine and just rest,I had hoped that she would at least remember the promise and I mentioned that promise, she looked me straight in the and just slammed back an entire glass of wine. That feeling I mentioned got worse and I couldn't do anything just cry.  I called my neighbor, who happened to be my co workers and my dads best friend to help out he brought his wife, my mother's best friend and they got her to calm down.\n\nAll went great after that, but I never really forgot I still feel betrayed. I love her, she is my mother, but I also know I can't handle a third time, I just can't.\n\nRecently we suspect, she started drinking again, CV she sometimes with hot weather had a beer and that's it, but it is starting to get worse. Yesterday she and I went out for a nice afternoon and she drank three, the first two I didn't mind but the third one let all alarm bells go off. \nI was paying the cheque and she asked for another beer because she was thirsty. I told her to take a drink for along the way to the car. She told me she couldn't walk with an open bottle on the street. It confused me until I figured she wanted another beer, I told her no, we have to go. She insisted and stood up to get her own. While there were alarms going of I figured that there's nothing going on, she didn't have slur in her speech, she didn't smell like beer. \n\nToday the alarm bells turned into a huge sign that's she's drinking again. I got home, nothing weird, dinner etc. all is fine. I go upstairs to my room to play some games and my dad approaches me.\n He tells me she did grocery's shopping, she told him some mayonaise and some pastry's. Around 3 \u00e0 4 euros in total, she spend eleven. There are empty bottles in a plastic bag in the pantry and I only recently got my own beer after not drinking beer since August. I had four bottles, I drank two, there are three bottles of my brand in the pantry. The plastic bag also has the favourite brand of my oldest brothers, who is currently on a roadtrip though Africa, he has been gone since October, he drank all his beer before he left.\n\n \nTo me it's obvious that she is drinking again. There is too much evidence, my dad doesn't want to start anything until my brother comes home.\n\nMy question is though, Or well my situation is, I don't know what to do. I love and respect that woman, I have no excuse to go away from this place, because this is all she does wrong.  But I just, I don't have the strength to do this again, I can't watch my mother drink and throw this family aside, I don't know what to do.",

            "selftext": "I\u2019ve had an issue on and off for the past few years. It got worse last year after I broke up with my ex. I don\u2019t drink often, but when I do I have to get drunk enough to fall asleep immediately. One of the reasons it started getting out of control was because I had issues sleeping, so I\u2019ve been using alcohol as sleeping aid.\n\nI can\u2019t remember the last time I went to be without either alcohol or sleeping pills. A while back my doctor prescribed me with Zolpidem, which I\u2019ve used on an off. But as I discovered, by accident, the very pleasant high it gives you, I started abusing that too. Until recently I was being religious about never mixing that with alcohol, but about a week ago my brain betrayed me and said \u201cfuck it, what\u2019s the worse that could happen\u201d.\n\nLast night I remember heading to bed after 20mg of zolpidem and a small glass of rum. I wake up a bit late for work today, but not embarrassingly late. Didn\u2019t even have a hangover or anything. I got home to a pretty messy living room, my gaming console missing, and a few other sleeping pills, that I don\u2019t use nowadays, scattered around a table. I was convinced someone had broken into my house. The TV-table out of place. A wire ripped off of the speakers. All of a sudden a flashback hit me, like a dream of a broken TV or something like that.\n\nIt was me. I got complete amnesia, apparently finished off the pack of zolpidem. Must have been 40mg left on that, and the devil knows how much of the other pills and rum I ended up taking. Broke my own TV and speaker set, and I wonder what other delightful surprises I must have left myself....\n\nWell at least I\u2019m starting to see a therapist this Friday, so I\u2019ve got that going for me, which is nice. Anyway, thanks for reading, and here\u2019s to getting my shit together.",

            "selftext": "Hey /r/alcoholism,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm here asking for advice on how best to confront my mother about her alcoholism. She's known she's had a problem and has gone through rehabilitation 2-3 times, but nothing has stuck. We suspect her husband is an enabler and may even have an alcohol problem himself as they won't throw out all alcohol in the home since \"he's not an alcoholic\". She just went to the hospital for high ammonia levels in the blood due to liver problems caused by her drinking. Her symptoms were severe to the point the she was zombie like. Yellow skin/eyes, completely unresponsive to questions, confused, disoriented. The few questions she would answer, she'd answer wrong or say I don't know. We've done the supportive tactic and have been very encouraging, but I don't feel it's helping. My grandmother went the same route and eventually died of liver problems herself, also caused by alcohol. This is now affecting my kids, as they've shown a good bit of concern for her as well.  \n\n\nI feel it's time now to stop being supportive and show hard love. This isn't in our nature, but I don't think anything else is working and see her dying in the next few years, if not months, if she doesn't take this seriously. I'm contemplating being blunt and letting her know all the consequences of an early death (my kids will barely remember her, if at all, she'll miss her daughters marriage and children entirely, etc). Then start distancing ourselves until there's absolutely no contact with her. I'd hate to go this path, but we've been supportive for years. I don't know what else we can do and hopeful for a meaningful way to hurt her enough to want to stop drinking.  \n\n\nDoes anyone have thoughts on this? I realize that the method of helping someone is completely dependent on the person the and circumstances. I just don't want to do something with good intention that would absolutely backfire. I appreciate everyone's feedback.",

My name's Andrew and I know I have a serious binge drinking problem. I'm only 24.  I wouldn't class myself as an alcoholic because I can go weeks without a drink and not feel anything, no cravings what so ever. My problem is binge drinking. If I have a beer at a family meal that's fine, I can go home to the land of nod. However, I used to binge drink with my friends who I fell out with in January. And since I made up with them I've started to drink a lot lot more than I should and I feel ashamed. If I drink at their house I have to lie to my parents about where I'm going. The weird thing is that my parents don't mind me getting drunk with friends and coming home, they just don't like me drinking in the house which is understandable because I've kicked off in the past. Just need some advice really? We'e moving to Wales in a few months so I get a fresh start thank God away from everything",

I didnt really even consider drinking alone to be much of an issue as I hate socialising  anyway.   \nI rationalised it as just relaxing with a glass of wine and watching tv, but I easily down a bottle or two of wine a night if i can. I dont have a lot of money as a full time student, and if I have spare change Ill buy a cheap bottle of wine.\n\nPart of  me doesnt believe I really have a problem, and part of me knows I do. Problem is, that part of me that doesnt believe I have a problem doesnt really want to/think i need to get any help or quit drinking. This is all really new to me, and I have no idea what to do and nobody to turn to. Im scared that the evidence is suggesting that I might have a problem, and I want more than anything to not be like my dad. \n\nThe part of me that knows i have a problem is freaking out, Ive gone to the dentist drunk, Ive gone to my exams drunk, i drink drive more than Id like to admit. I know I have a problem, and now I have a criminial record to top it off.\n\nWhat the hell do I do, where do i start, am i even in that much need of help? is it really serious yet? Am I deluding myself? Im just scared and confused and I dont want to add alcoholism to my huge list of mental health problems and shit. Its a huge taboo in my family, and Im ashamed to even consider I might have a problem really. This is all a bit convoluted cause Im panic posting, but any advice, support, ideas, anything you wanna share with me Id love to hear. Im at a loss. \n\nThanks reddit",

I never thought it was a problem until I could comfortably drink a 750ml of jager and still have room for stout beers before bed. I started drinking so I could fall asleep faster when I worked nightshift and I struggle to have a sober day more than once a month. I know I\u2019m an alcoholic because I have been stressed about keeping alcohol stored for Sundays (it\u2019s illegal to sell alcohol on Sunday\u2019s where I live). \n  I obviously don\u2019t want this to be the rest of my life. Alcoholism runs in my family. Any time I don\u2019t drink, I\u2019m using another substance. I\u2019ve sought out therapy and a doctor but it hardly helped. Overall it\u2019s just much cheaper short term to keep drinking VS shelling out a lot of cash going to therapy/Dr visits. I\u2019m currently unemployed so I can get sober. My funds are low and I really need to change my life or I\u2019m going to be broke, single, homeless and suffer from the chains of alcohol. \n  What are steps that I can take to not crave \u201cgetting trashed\u201d every single day? Would it be better or easier to replace it with something like weed or simply cut out all substances?",

            "selftext": "Hi all, great sub, appreciate as many perspectives on this question as possible.  I\u2019m speaking with my sponsor and other trusted mentors in my fellowship, but the more opinions the better!\n\nI\u2019ve been sober now for just under 20 months.  I\u2019ve got a solid program, sponsor calls daily, average of 1-2 meetings a day.  I\u2019m starting a new career tomorrow.  Grateful for where I am, and very watchful of losing it through slowing down or stopping the things that got me here.\n\nI didn\u2019t date or do much of anything during my active alcoholism.  Even before that, relationships were fairly rare.  But it\u2019s something I want in life: eventually marriage and a family.  I\u2019m not in a great hurry, and like I said, keeping my sponsor in the loop.\n\nI have heard nightmare stories about harassment and even abuse within the fellowship for years: men preying on female newcomers, or harassing female members into avoiding certain meetings.  I would NEVER want to this, even inadvertently; I\u2019d also hate to even be mistakenly seen to be acting like that.  Just as importantly, I would never want to do or say anything that could make a woman feel uncomfortable coming to a meeting.\n\nAlong with the above, I don\u2019t want to do anything that may hurt my own sobriety.  Relationships between addicts can go good or bad , just like any other.\n\nSo...aside from work, most of my free time is spent in the rooms, and at church functions.  Naturally, I managed to join the parish in town with an average parishioner age of 65, so there\u2019s not anything going on there.  \n\nTo the point: there\u2019s a woman that I see at a few meetings a week.  We\u2019ve talked casually before and after meetings, she\u2019s definitely someone I\u2019m interested in.  Beautiful, very sweet and hilarious, great personality.  She\u2019s also got 5 years sober, and I know her sponsor, who is a \u201cwise sage\u201d around here.  In short...I don\u2019t know what the fuck to do!\n\nMy sponsor seems satisfied that I\u2019m in a good place, and he\u2019s not opposed to in-fellowship relationships out of hand.  But, in light of everything above, just not sure how to proceed.\n\nAny personal experiences or opinions are really appreciated.  Thanks!",

It\u2019s pretty easy living here on the drinking side, if the wife pisses me off...drink, can\u2019t fall asleep..drink, bored...drink.  I could do this until I die and be ok. I\u2019ve played with tapering off by extending the time I take my first drink by 1/2 hour every day but I have never made it past 7:00pm before the anxiety gets too high and my heart beat gets irregular . It just seams like I\u2019m trying to climb over a mountain that is just too high and the presumptive rewards on the other side are just not worth it. My question is, for those of you who have crossed that mountain from severe dependence to sobriety; was it worth it?  Are you happier sober?  If you could give your former self any advice, what would it be? What is better about your life now that you are sober?

How do I support them with us moving into our own place? \n\n(We\u2019ve been staying with our parents to save for a huge down payment on a home). The fear expressed is that when we are in our own home, they wont have the safety net of their parents. (Christian household where no one drinks, parents will stay up late waiting for them to come home so they don\u2019t stay out late out of respect for them). \n\nIm not a drinker, so alcohol will not be bought. I just want to know the proper way to support them . Thanks!",

She was a tattoo artist so she was \u201cedgy\u201d. I obviously never got sober again, I\u2019m also not with her. Been through a couple more women since. \n\nI feel like with every break up it gets worse. I\u2019m sure my alcoholism has been a factor in the break ups, but at the end of them they all seem to show that they are all very superficial. So that in return makes me head harder into my alcohol. All I do is go home from work immediately start drinking and try to make music. This might sound stupid but I can\u2019t play video games anymore. I used to love them. I never go out because I feel like I\u2019ll be the one that gets way more drunk than everyone and make a complete ass of myself. \n\nI can\u2019t even begin to explain how fucking lonely this world feels. Growing up I didn\u2019t have a conventional family. My father wasn\u2019t there. My mom killed herself while also trying to take my brother with her. It feels like literally no one on this earth cares about you or that you exist. \n\nI feel like I hold the weight of the universe in my chest. Nothing makes sense anymore. \n\nI feel like when I drink it\u2019s like the key to a magical door that transports me to another world where all I have are my thoughts. It\u2019s just not a happy magical place. But for some reason it\u2019s comfortable. \n\nI can\u2019t even afford to have this habit. I don\u2019t get paid shit at my dead end job, but for some reason I keep going back to it. I\u2019ll wake up feeling like shit, regretful, but as soon as night hits and I\u2019m feeling better it\u2019s like I completely forget why I shouldn\u2019t. \n\nI can\u2019t do AA I\u2019m not religious. I\u2019m not knocking anyone that is, it\u2019s just not my thing. I can\u2019t afford rehab either. Everyone\u2019s too busy living their lives. I almost feel like I\u2019m on a motorcycle heading for a cliff but instead slowing down I just want to push harder into throttle. \n\nFor anyone that reads this I don\u2019t expect the internet to fix my problem. I think I just needed to type this out. The inside of my mind feels like faceless human silhouette banging at a glass cube they\u2019re stuck in.",

He had a rough history with alcoholism and I also had a real problem with being drunk all through my 20's.  I keep seeing different counselors and I keep trying to make myself make better decisions.   I have a good job that can support us both, he works in his own industry as well, and we have a normal up and down married life.   We don't drink when we go out, and we smugly turn down friends or acquaintances that offer us a drink,  and we keep nothing in the house. It seems so easy for him to just stop.  He seems super proud of his determination and I am proud of him.   But when I go to work, having a beer is the first thing I do.   I drink it quickly and try to get the most out of my quick buzz before going into all out paranoia and eating and drinking countless glasses of water to make sure all of evidence of my drinking is gone before I see him again at the end of my shift 8 hours later.  I work in an industry where I'm just talking to guests and managing a restaurant floor.  I always feel that having a few drinks in me makes me more outgoing and a smoother operator for the floor.   I have social anxiety that has all been cured with Zoloft, but I ALWAYS think there's a better version of me behind a beer or two.  Sometimes, I'll over do it and still smell like alcohol when I get home and then I'll try and lie about it and it creates this circle of hurt where I see myself hurting my husband, who thinks if I just loved him enough it wouldn't be an issue, and I can't explain in the right way that it has absolutely nothing to do with my love for him.    This has gone in circles of pain for years, and every time I fuck up, I feel him slipping further away, and I get it's MY FAULT, but I don't know what kind of help I actually need.  It's more about the urge to rebel against our pact, lie about it, and I have so much pleasure in just getting away with it.   Just spending a few hours relaxed and happy from the alcohol.   I just love that brief feeling of being the (perceived) best version of myself.   BUt I also very much just want to have an honest and happy marriage and not have a chain bound to me that separates me from the man I very much love.",

Now we are on good terms as any father son even tho we weren't never *that* close. Now i see his drinking as problematic when he is sober i love hanging with him maybe we just silently watch tv but that is fine by me. He is my father and i want to help him so i would like all of your advice",

            "selftext": "This is my first post on Reddit ever, so I'm not 100% sure how everything works but I'm quite enjoying this community. Reading everyone's struggles and the support given is really motivating and beautiful. \n\nWell, to put it simply: I'm a 17 year old girl and have been daily binge drinking for the past 5 months. I've gone through bottles and bottles of cheap vodka, rum, beer, wine, or whatever I can get my hands on and steal or water down. I'm currently in online school and work three days out of the week in order to pay for my car and rent. I'm a junior in high school and have been a straight A student until now. My grades are plummeting and I have D's for this entire semester. \n\nMy family knew something was wrong with me because I've been lying to them for months on end. I have broken every rule they've given me simply because I'm so drunk I don't remember what they said, or I just get drunk and have awful judgement. Just yesterday they broke down and cried because I was failing and lying and they were so hurt that they had taken me in from an abusive house and tried to raise me right, but I'd failed them. \n\nThey dumped my room and searched through everything. They found empty chaser bottles, empty wine bottles hidden in old backpacks, and suitcases full of empty liquor bottles that I had stolen from the garage stash. \n\nI told them that I had a problem drinking and broke down crying. I had been drunk the whole morning. They saw my failing grades and were almost relieved that it was an alcohol problem rather than me being an evil lying monster. \n\nThey're fully supportive of helping me recover from my problem, allowing me a few shots of beer during the day to wean off of drinking. They keep all of the alcohol in a place where they would see me take it and I have to ask whenever I need a drink. \n\nIt's day two of the whole weaning off of drinking thing and I'm almost full of regret for telling them that I have a drinking problem. They've given me time to catch up on my school work and allowed me to continue going to my job. I'm so thankful that I've been forgiven and given this opportunity, but I still feel awful that I've been doing nothing but lying and failing at everything that I do. \n\nI was drunk at a family member's funeral in January the entire time and barely remember anything. \n\nI didn't even know my problem was so bad until I stepped into my car to run to the grocery store and almost hit a pedestrian while backing out of the parking lot because I had forgotten to check my mirrors in a drunken paranoid hurry.\n\nThe point is, I feel regretful that I can no longer drink. I look at the bottles of whiskey and crave to be drunk. I have feelings of nausea, exhaustion, and dehydration though I've been doing nothing but drinking water. I want to feel happy and drunk and relieved again, but at the same time. I know that I almost ruined my entire life and future by driving drunk and destroying my family's respect for my word. \n\nI really want to drink and sleep but I have so much responsibility now. Any advice on avoiding the bottle just for today while I sit and do schoolwork and occasionally chores? I have work tomorrow and am worried I'll end up at the gas station for another bottle.",

            "selftext": "I started drinking approximately 2.5 years ago (I think). At the beginning, it was just small amounts once a week. After a year or so I started drinking stuff with more alcohol per volume so essentially I went from 4 lokos to liquors containing 35% alcohol. I'd buy a 750 ml bottle of liquor once a week but even then it got worse. The past half a year (probably longer) I would probably buy two 750 ml bottles per week and of course drink them both. \n\nNow that you know my background, maybe you can make a better guess. I haven't had any alcohol in my system since Monday so about 5 days now. I'm not at all tempted to drink at this point but I just leaned that quitting cold turkey is bad for you. But I don't know if the amount I drank would even put me at risk for withdrawal symptoms. \n\nEssentially, I'm starting to get nervous because I have no idea what if anything will happen. Should I be worried? Or am overreacting. Thus far I've had no withdrawal symptoms unless feeling sweatier than usual counts.\n\nPlease, let me know what I should do.",

I'm sure this is because on Friday I got trashed. Binge drinking is a problem for me. I can go for a couple of days or even weeks without a drink, and sometimes if I go out I keep it calm and cut out of the pub after 2 beers (although I admit that awakes a thirst so that if I walk home by the shop I might pop in for a couple of cans). It's not the regular desire to drink that is bothering me - although maybe it should - its the emotional hangovers that are so immensely crippling to me. I have so much to do but I've spent all day yesterday and all morning in bed, racked with apocalyptic guilt for no real reason, depressed and tired. This happens at least once a month and takes so long to recover from. Apart from giving up the booze entirely, and I think it's best to address that solution sooner than later, what I want to know is how do you manage to pick yourselves back up if you ever felt that low?",

My mom also had a alcoholic boyfriend that my twin brother and I I had lived with for 5 years. This lead to my mom getting arrested for battery when I was 12. Fast forward a year in 2013 when grandpa(mom\u2019s father) died. This took a tole on my mom and this is when her drinking problem starting getting worse. Sometime\u2019s she would drive with in the car while intoxicated. I\u2019ve seen her yell at my stepdad, she\u2019s defiantly a mean drunk. One day after walking home from school in my freshman year, I came home to mom, who had locked herself in the bathroom, banging on the door repeatedly, and mumbling words mixed with crying, I could tell she was on the ground. She did this for hours and I didn\u2019t see her until the next day. Her and my dad also had a pill problem and took (fentanyl, oxytocin, Xanax, vicodin). Why I had to grow through this and had the parents I had, I don\u2019t know. But they also made me stronger. I\u2019m now 18 and my mom has been sober for a few years now and I\u2019m so grateful and proud of her for overcoming this demon named \u201calcohol\u201d. Has anyone else had a similar childhood and experienced similar things?",

            "selftext": "Ok so I am new to this posting thing and I would never post on here my personal business like this but I need advice. This will be a sort of long post I guess. My brother had his first major episode when he was 13. He drank too much and got rushed to the hospital when he was found choking on his vomit in the woods. What happened next was years of uncontrollable drinking and parents that said not my kid and did everything to possibly coddle him from having any repercussions of out of control drinking.\nThe parents divorced about 11 years ago and my brother lives with my step dad his dad. My mom purchased a car for him thinking that would motivate him to get a job. Instead he trashed it in a dui with a .320 blood alcohol level. He has never worked and my step dad fills the keg weekly for him. He has had a seizure when his Dad will get in a mood and cut him off. He has been in a mental institution a few years ago from running away from a voluntary rehab when he thought they were bugging his phone. He was told he has alcoholic hepatitis and extremely high liver levels. That was several years ago.\nI got him insurance and he told me he would go to rehab. I asked his dad to take him to Intake and then we would come up and take him to the rehab near us I actually got him a bed. His dad said he wouldn\u2019t go to intake. He will never stop drinking beer and if you question him he blocks you. Which has made my mom never see him, because she is afraid he won\u2019t answer the door which is common. He also will block her. \nI talked to his dad and he said he is allowed to have a beermeister if wants one and that my brother shouldn\u2019t control what he has. He also said he wants no blame and he isn\u2019t burying him when he dies. He also has told my brother why don\u2019t you just die already. \nMy mother,  sister and I are worried so is my other younger brother. I don\u2019t know what I can do? I don\u2019t have any control of the situation and I can\u2019t even get him to go to the Doctor. \nTonight my sister finally saw him and said he looks horrible has a big round belly and is yellow but not dark yellow. His ankles are swollen which they have been. All this kid does is sit and play video games and drink, and watch sports I guess. He is at a point now where he won\u2019t FaceTime, lost his funny personality,  hasn\u2019t had a haircut since December and doesn\u2019t leave the house. I\u2019m talking months now. I don\u2019t know what to do? My mom was supposed to go and sneak over and see him tomorrow but she said now she isn\u2019t because he finally started talking to her again. \nWhat can I do? I can\u2019t sit back and watch my brother die. It\u2019s also not fair that we always wind up getting into fights over him when he doesn\u2019t care.",

No car, friends are degenerates as well, I needed the \u201cbreak\u201d anyway.

So I managed to lose my ID for the second time in a week. But this time it\u2019s nowhere to be found. So no cigarettes. And most importantly, no beer. I was heavily drinking that \u201cgarbage\u201d daily. 6 7-8% on a \u201cgood day\u201d (like if I was working), and 7-10 otherwise. Of course had more if I was day drinking, which I heavily began to do recently. \n\nBut I just love my IPAs. Yeah no wonder I was bloated and gaining weight, I know. Shh. \n\nFirst day I did WD a little bit. Nothing extreme, had it way worse with whiskey a year ago. Shakes, sweats, anxiety, blah blah. I got past that. I still am sleeping like absolute shit. My anxiety is still awful, on top of my general anxiety. I just want a cigarette and a six pack. But unfortunately, I am going to be sober for another two and a half weeks knowing my lazy ass won\u2019t bother to do anything shady, and I have no one to ask to buy it for me.

I live in constant fear and anxiety when he gets behind the wheel multiple times a day. He has overleveraged the finances and fired our best employee. Every type of intervetion, taking his keys, heart to hearts etc. nothing works. \n\nAt this point dealing with the consequences of his addiction have taken an intense toll on my own mental heath.

They're probably right. \n\nThe thing is though..... I can remember being 9 years old and wanting to die because of the life I was in. I never really felt loved. I got married young and wound up in an abusive relationship because I wanted to be loved. It destroyed me and while I fought alcohol and drugs during that time I was raped. I never told anyone.\n\nI went out drinking one night because I hated everything that WAS me and got in an accident and a DUI that was later reduced. No one was hurt thank God. But that wasn't before I really started to realize I was an alcoholic. I actually quit drinking, got a degree, and a damn good job.\n\nMy mother and step father both committed suicide a couple of years after that. \n\nBut things sort of started to spiral. I fell in love with a married man who coached me into bettering my life- and he DID. I have a very successful job, live alone, and finances are stressful but when I look at it, they are just a number.\n\nThe thing is. I've never felt truly loved or wanted. The people I loved the most are the ones that harmed me the most. The man I was with, am with\n..... I try to leave so much..... no one in my life knows I drink like I do to deal with the pain. \n\nI could not and cannot imagine a life without alcohol to deaden the hurt in my heart. The guy who helped me- he uses me. Has a ton of excellent excuses to prove he loves me but fuck I know he doesnt. My family... they didnt leave me because they thought I had a problem; they guessed but didnt know. They left me for loving my mother's family. \n\nFuck divorce. \n\nI moved cities. \n\nI am trying\n \nBut honestly I cant imagine my life without alcohol because it keeps me from really really feeling all the pain from the people I've loved. I am very much known as someone who would give their left arm for a stranger- and well, it's probably true because I want to believe in people so badly.\n\nI don't know how to stop. I dont know that I want to. The thing I want the most is to be loved but money, even feelings/compassion for others cant make that happen. I was raised in a very small circle. I want to expand that circle and maybe make new friends and people to love who love me but at this point- letting others in seems stupid. \n\nI feel so lost",

            "selftext": "Hi. My father is an alcoholic and has been for my entire life. I\u2019m a 21 year old girl and I\u2019m just home from college on break. Every time I go home i fall into an incredible depression because of my dad. He has never beat me, but I am unsure if he\u2019s ever beat my mom (she doesn\u2019t like me to worry about her, so I know she\u2019d never tell me). He has broken car windows when I was young and locked myself in the car to escape him, thrown bottles at me, punched holes in all the walls and doors, ripped doors off the hinges, etc., all in drunken fits of rage. I am terrified to be around him and usually end up locking myself in my room for days at a time as I\u2019m too afraid to go downstairs and interact with him. \n\nThe problem with my dad is that he\u2019ll NEVER admit to being an alcoholic, despite the few times he\u2019s been to rehab and the MANY times he\u2019s gone through withdrawal. The guys had two strokes, his life hasn\u2019t been easy and he\u2019s deff sufferred from depression resulting from the strokes. I feel bad for him and I know he uses alcohol to cope, but I can\u2019t help but wish he would just disappear sometimes. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t believe in AA or medication. He drunk drives constantly and I don\u2019t know how he hasn\u2019t gotten caught, but I can\u2019t bring myself to be the one to report him.... he is my dad, after all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m asking here, I guess I just don\u2019t know what to do. I have been on every depression and anxiety medication in the book, been going to therapy since fourth grade, talked to friends about it and nothing helps. When I\u2019m around my dad I am full of sadness, fear, and hatred, but when I\u2019m not around I\u2019m full of fear for my mother. My mother won\u2019t leave him because she for some reason still loves him deep down she says. He also can\u2019t function on his own, so I know if they divorced he\u2019d end up dead and i know she doesn\u2019t want to be \u201cresponsible\u201d for that. \n\nHis alcoholism has caused me so many problems in my life with my self esteem, relationships, friendships, anxiety, depression... you get the point. \n\nMy mother won\u2019t leave him, he won\u2019t get help, it\u2019s all just waiting for him to get arrested due to a DUI, or die. That\u2019s all there\u2019s left to wait for. I know there\u2019s not a lot of advice to give me, I just felt like I needed to share I guess, and I know my friends are sick of hearing about it - as they\u2019ve been hearing the same horror story since second grade. \nThanks for reading if you did!",

            "selftext": "Hello, I'm 20. \n\nI'm a student. I've been looking to move out, but haven't been able to, for the reason detailed below. I work when I'm not at university, but can't get enough money together. I was working at term time, but it was too much to handle as my course is demanding, so I've had to just work during downtimes. \n\nMy mother has been a closet alcoholic for the past 5 years. It all started to due to family competition, (we all stay on the same land, its a shared farm) between my mum and aunt, who both are different religions, hate each other and my grandparents mostly sided with my aunt, as she is an actual rational person. My mother isn't.\n\nMy mum's family come down to help her, and she just ends up laughing and joking and being as happy as she can be while drunk out of her head. They leave, and nothing gets done. She yoyos between hating me and loving me within a minute. She also has some suspected, but undiagnosed mental health problems. I cannot cope with all of it. Right now her family are in again, and they are all laughing and joking. \n\nMy mum kicks my dad out regularly, an event that has again, yesterday, happened again. My brother is 8 years old, and so, with my mum out of the count, and my dad thrown out, I am next in line to look after him. This all happens for a few days, maybe a week. Then all of a sudden she let's my dad in, sobers up, life is good and it happens again. I have no Influence, and my parents view my opinion as that of a child's, I am constantly put down and made to feel inferior, made to feel a liar, made to feel I am a spoilt child and have everything I could ever dream of. I had a good upbringing, but for the past few years I am constantly made to feel spoilt and so have rejected any help from my family. \n\nI have no clue where to go in this saga. I am more than happy making sure my brother is OK when this happens, but I honestly have no clue what the hell to do about anything. It's a vicious cycle where in a family intervention no body bloody cares, everyone is keen in this cycle. Crap, even I get taken by it when everything is OK. I don't know what to do anymore.",

A full bottle or two of wine in a day, or the worst case I've personally seen was 16 beers in an 8 hour period.   \n\n\nCombined with a few other general relationship issues we are on a break right now till she can get a handle on this &amp; other things. I'm still trying to be supportive to her, but she insists shes not an alcoholic. I asked her to attend AA meetings, which she refused &amp; then countered with going to bi-weekly therapy to get at her underlieing reasons for drinking(past abuse in relationships). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admittedly am not much of a drinker, never have been. I think I've been drunk maybe once when I was 21(I'm 34 now). I've got basically no experience on how to handle this or interpret if I'm being too much of a hard ass on her, or if shes not owning up to her problem?   \n\n\nShe doesnt like the setup for AA, which I can understand isnt for everyone. But she wont even admit to having a problem, which is the harder thing I'm grappling with. She did pour out all the alcohol in her house down the sink yesterday. So I know that shes willing to work on this. I'd just really like any advice you all might have.",

            "selftext": "I am 27M and I think I have a problem with alcohol. It has been impacting me and my life for too long and I am looking for some advice. \n\nSo I have grown up fairly \u201cnormal\u201d. There is a weird history of alcoholism in my family. My uncle is an alcoholic, and so is my ex-stepdad and ex-grandpa (long story but there\u2019s been a few break ups in my family). My whole thing is I always assumed since most of the alcoholism was not genetic, I was fine. But the more this haunts me, the more I feel like it\u2019s the exposure I have which makes me an alcoholic or at least just someone who struggles. \n\nI never feel like I\u2019m an alcoholic because I don\u2019t drink consistently. I can do weeks without booze and it has zero impact. \n\nBut when I do drink. It\u2019s all or nothing. I can\u2019t just have \u201ca couple\u201d. Once I have had 3+ my body takes over and I suddenly can\u2019t say no to booze. I\u2019ll do shots, drink tons, and just eventually fall asleep/pass out. It\u2019s embarrassing and humiliating.  But no matter what I try, I can\u2019t control it and it always ends up with me passed out or doing dumb stuff. I am married and have told my wife I can get it under wraps and drink in moderation...but I\u2019m very sad to say it doesn\u2019t seem to be the truth. I don\u2019t want to lose my wife and my life. Should I just give up alcohol all together and go sober? Advice or input is appreciated",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nFirst post here -- been lurking a bit, think this is a great community from the helpful posts I've read thus far.\n\nI've been experiencing a dull pain in my upper abdomen in different spots for several months now. Comes and goes, sometimes just feels like a pinching sensation, but can be a minor pain/soreness as well. Doesn't go away if I take a night off drinking a six-pack. Hasn't gone away after cutting my days drinking in half a week. \n\nI'm ready to make a doctor's appointment, but can't till after the weekend. In the meantime, has anyone else experienced this and have an outcome to report? Liver damage? Is cutting back okay, or is cold turkey quitting the only way to get this pain to vanish?\n\nTHANK YOU GUYS/GALS",

The last 4 years he broke his head and his femur when he got drunk alone during the week. What was supposed to be a wake up call turned out to lead to 2 unsuccessful attempts of rehab (is that the correct term for alcoholism in English?).\nHe swore he would be sober by Easter, he was not. Today I had to tell him about his cousin s death. Hours later on the family chat we had some cynical and very inadequate message from him about that. I am pretty sure he was wasted during this. I have brought him to a specialized centre, I offered him a dairy where he could follow his daily consumption. He promised but nothing followed. Should I give up? (  It is so selfish, but by wedding is in summer 2020 and I am so afraid of him spoiling everything because he might we wasted.). Any tips on how I can talk to him, help him or even only protecting myself is very welcome.",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone.   \n\n\nI've recently decided to try and tackle my drinking problem, have been a binge drinker since I was 14 (23 now) and have been a consistent daily drinker for about 2 years, with occasional nights off. Have had periods of daily drinking throughout my life, but this 2 year stint is definitely the only time I've really struggled to stop.   \n\n\nI drink every night, to excess, but very varying degree's, almost always beer, sometimes 4 pints a night, sometimes much higher, occasionally no drink at all. I almost never drink before mid-day.   \n\n\nI had a cross addiction with weed that I've managed to cut out after a slight taper, but it was basically cold turkey. I went to my doctor about general mental health, and we got on the topic of my drinking.   \n\n\nDocs advice is that I've been drinking too much for too long, and that I now need to taper instead of going cold turkey, but the issue is I want to go cold turkey, I keep f\\*cking up my tapering plan because there's a crate of beer in the house, I drink the 4 beers I'm allowed, and if it's been a particularly bad day, all willpower goes out the window and I binge quite hard. I feel like if I resigned myself to cold turkey and had no beer on person, this wouldn't be an issue.   \n\n\nAm I safe to just ignore my doctor and go cold turkey? Have recently been around 36 hours no drink, and had mild shakes and heart palpitations, but nothing serious, again, rarely drink before mid-day. Is it best to follow doctors advice and try and regulate my binge behaviour? Or can I just cut it out and hope for best?  \n\n\nTIA. Stay strong everyone.",

I thought I had dodged the bullet that ricocheted throughout the family like neo; I'm already older than my Dad was when he finally got sober after 40 years of hell...I thought I had beat the game.  I was the stronger man that had learned from the past...I thought.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut my sense of pride and accomplishment turned from a sixer of craft beer per week...to a case...to a fifth of vodka first thing in the morning.  A 2 year slow fall to rock bottom.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLuckily for me, all I've lost is that sense of pride and probably a few years off my life from whatever I've done to my poor body.  My wife and family are still here, and now so am I.  I'm back.  I'm present in my life again.  One without alcohol.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMaybe I was stronger than my Dad.

Alcohol came into my life like a snake in the grass; I'd always had anxiety and depression problems and when I got drunk for the first time at 14 it felt like the greatest feeling on Earth. I could talk to people and have fun, the pain and darkness within myself went away, even if it was only temporary; \"I wish I could be like this all the time\" I thought to myself.\n\nWell guess what... I tried that and it has led me to very dark places. I often wonder how it would've been if I'd not taken the decision to start drinking heavily and instead faced my demons and addressed why I always felt the need to escape. Well maybe at least I can start now.\n\nI need to change my mentality and my attitude, I always told my self that my life was gonna suck anyway so I might as well get drunk. But... What if maybe my life didn't have to suck? What if I could actually become something I can smile at when I look at the reflection. Loneliness, abandonment- I always felt like everyone in my life always leaves me behind, but alcohol won't ever leave me. Alcohol is always there, come to me, make me feel nice and warm, put me to sleep and make the silence and darkness seem invisible.\n\nAlcohol has been a crutch for any problem I've had in my life, my approach to most personal problems I've had has been to get drunk and forget about it. But now I'm done, it's a new day.\nI will be a better person.",

            "selftext": "My mum has been an alcoholic since I was born, pretty much. Sorry if I appear insensitive over the topic but my patience is really being tried at the moment. \n\nShe currently claims that she \u2018needs to drink\u2019 to \u2018avoid having a seizure.\u2019 I know that last time she attempted to quit, she did it in a completely unsafe way, and ended up having quite a few serious seizures and a dislocated shoulder during withdrawal, so I can understand this fear.\n\nBut she\u2019s drinking even more than she did pre-quitting attempt. Like, waking up to a sizeable glass of wine, and drinking a full box a day. (I know to some this may seem minor, but she\u2019s a massive lightweight and is noticeably drunk after one glass.) \n\nI\u2019m just not sure that she \u2018needs\u2019 to drink as much as she claims she does? It feels to me like an excuse to start again, as I\u2019ve watched this same pattern happen countless times over the past 15 years. Although she makes out like she is wanting to stop again, the only thing to suggest this is true is her words. \n\nIt is also really difficult to gauge how she will act when drunk. Sometimes she is emotional and shares things about myself, my dad and my family that I would never want to know. Sometimes she tries to set me up with boys she deems \u2018worthy\u2019 and scares them off in the process. Sometimes she berates me for my life choices. No matter which way, it is directly affecting ME as well as her. I\u2019m not in a position emotionally to deal with it.\n\nSo basically, do you really need to drink that much to avoid a seizure? Or is she having me on? If she is, I\u2019m considering cutting contact for a while, for my own sake. I know it\u2019s important to show support for her during this process, but it\u2019s been my entire life, I give so much and get nothing back, and it\u2019s fucking up my life now too.",

I have depleted vitamin levels, elevated liver enzymes and basically malnourished. I\u2019ve been hitting the gym and some days my cardio is amazing and I can go forever and some days I am like and overweight elderly person that can barely get through the day.  Has anyone any recommendations on how to get healthy enough for pregnancy after torturing my body ? Has anyone else gone through healing for baby ? I\u2019m taking prenatal vitamins  plus extra b  vitamins and still feel weak. My doctor thinks I wasn\u2019t drinking enough to damage my body but I know otherwise.

            "selftext": "To all who consider reading this,\n\nI've been drinking at pretty significant levels for over a 18 months/1.5 years, poison of choice being bottom shelf 100 proof vodka, with the caveat of two trips to rehab, 5 trips to a psychiatric ward for an average stay of a week and a recent 4 month period of unemployment. Recently, I've started a new job as a design engineer while re-starting an old job at an casual italian restaurant. On my off time, I can't stay away from the bottle. As soon as I'm in my room, I'm drinking at a rate of at least 5-20 sufficient pulls from the bottle per hour (depending on my level of occupation/what I'm doing in addition to the drinking) for at least 3-4 hours, until I usually fall asleep *with the competency to put my laptop on the chair beside my bed with a music playlist playing*. Regardless, I wake up most days pretty drunk, very dehydrated and fatigued. \n\nMy ask of the reddit community, specifically the recovering alcoholics community active on this site, is to objectively detail his or her experiences with the physical and mental effects he or she has experienced due to chronic alcohol abuse.\n\nWith the preliminary details provided, may I provide further quantitative aspects about myself.\n\n-22 years old (7/19/1996)\n-male\n-5 ft 10 in (rounding up from 5 ft 9 and 3/4 in lol)\n-180 lbs, maybe 5-10% body fat (I've always retained muscle definition as I'm consistently physically active)\n-diet: high fat, low carb - wholistic but probably malnutrioned ... I eat only when hungry; when I'm hungry, I eat what fills me up the most - fiber is a nutrient responsible for feeling full, so I'll eat a handful of leafy greens (spinach, kale, arugula or chard) by itself, fruits and avocados, greek yogurt, milk, aged cheddar cheese, nuts and berries, grains like oatmeal and pasta, red meats and chicken, flax seed oil for omega 3's or 6's or whatever they have, etc.) point is, I consider a lot of factors before consuming some food. granted, every once and a while I'll get subway or mcdonalds\n\nSo to anyone who has been a heavy alcoholic in his or her early life, please lend your experience in what lead you to the conclusion that you needed to change.\n\nThanks to all who read this post, and more importantly, to those who contributed feedback. Cheers to you all",

            "selftext": "TLDR: my boyfriend quit drinking 3 weeks ago and feels like he lost part of himself and his identity and doesn't know what to do. I'm not going to tell him what to do and I trust him to make his own decisions. How can I help him learn how to enjoy things without alcohol? What is something encouraging or supportive that I can say or do for him? And what are some things you do when you feel that you want or drink?\n\n\nMy bf has been drinking on and off for almost 20 yrs Starting around 6 months ago, things started to go downhill in his life and he was drinking, but not past his \"limit\" everyday. I have been with him throughout 2.5 years and seen changes in him, however, He has never been violent or abusive and either gets funny or depressed. I put \"limit\" in quotes because I am all too familair with the strategies they use to control themselves. I was in a toxic long term relationship with an alcoholic who refused to get help.\n\nMy bf stopped drinking 3 weeks ago. 2 nights ago, he had a few drinks, about 1/4 of what he used to have, and it was because he got upset about something (not related to me) and the first thing he said was that he needed a beer. I had been telling him how happy I was that he was making positive changes and how proud I am of him. He's been spending every night here because that reduces outside influences, and 2 nights ago when he drank, I was trying not to let my feelings show but he could tell I was disappointed. I told him that I really just want what's best for him, and I just didn't want him to wake up the next morning thinking what the hell did I do? I don't really know what to do or say to help him, and he said to just let him do what he wants because he knows what he's doing and can take care of himself. I never intended to do that. I know that he is capable of making his own decisions.\n\nThat same night he was telling me that he feels lost. He told me that the alcohol is like a part of him. And now that he's not drinking he feels like he lost a part of himself., part of his identity. He is perfectly aware that he used to self-medicate, and now he says he feels like he's been thrown into the middle of the woods and is trying to find his way out. He knows that he wants to get better. He knows that he wants to stop drinking. And he still has a good part of his life left to make the best of it.\n\nYesterday I invited him out to play catch at the park. Sometimes we play sports, or we watch movies. He used to write a lot, so I was going to recommend that maybe he start doing that again, but I fear that he may not be mentally or emotionally capable or ready to do that yet. I know he wants to get better, but he really just doesn't know where to go or where to start. I also told him that it's going to take some time. To get used to this \"new life.\" \n\nAre there any recommendations for things you do when you feel like you need a drink? I am not going to stop him from drinking if that's what he wants to do. I also know it's not my job to keep him distracted. Is there anything your SO has done or said or does currently to support you emotionally and mentally?",

I have been drinking for two years, the first year was a whole bottle(70cl) of 3/4 of it a day. I have slowly weaned myself off and in the last couple of months have only been having half a bottle or less of a 70cl, most of the time it's less. I only really drink hard liquors, mainly gin and rum. I'm working on myself slowly and have no idea why I had the urge to post this.",

Screaming, pushing, telling me I was worthless... I got into the habit because being numb was better than being sad or just watching it happen. Soon got to the point I was drinking every day because it wasn\u2019t a good day without alcohol.\n\nAfter that relationship ended I still drank a lot but not as often. Then two months ago I was open with my newer partner and said I think I have a problem and don\u2019t want to drink as much anymore. I know I use alcohol to cope with stress, anger and even boredom.\nShe was/is super supportive and doesn\u2019t drink herself so it wasn\u2019t too hard. I decided if we went out I might have a drink but never to have it in the house.\n\n\nDrank once in the last two months so last night I thought I\u2019d \u2018treat myself\u2019 and bought a bottle of vodka. Had the intention of only drinking maybe 3 shots. I drank more than half the bottle and have no memory of last night.\n\nWorst part is I woke up and put my arm around my partner and she just started bawling. I was terrible to her last night. We\u2019ve been together six months and she said I never talked to her the way I did last night and I scared her to the point she stayed awake most of the night.\n\nI can\u2019t explain how awful I feel for now being the abuser, especially because I know first hand what it\u2019s like on the receiving side of a rude, terrible drunk.\nShe said she won\u2019t do it again and I told her no she won\u2019t cuz I won\u2019t be drinking again. I poured the rest of the vodka out.\n\nI don\u2019t want alcohol to destroy what\u2019s good in my life but I don\u2019t know if I have a drinking problem or if I\u2019m an alcoholic. I guess I\u2019m wondering if meetings would be overkill or unnecessary and I should just go sober on my own? I feel confused and a bit lost. \nAny advice is welcome\n\nI just downloaded the \u2018I Am Sober\u2019 app as well.",

            "selftext": "My bf (38M) and I (31F) have a pretty solid, drama-free relationship. We are loving and supportive. I cannot possibly explain all the amazing intricacies of our relationship before delving into this issue but suffice it to say: he's great and we are both the happiest we have ever been. We've talked about a future.\n\nOne issue. About 3 times in the past 13 months, he has gotten stumbling drunk, and this is only when he drinks whiskey or hard liquor. Beer never gets him this drunk. One time, he flaked on a brunch with my friends and me because he was drunk/hungover, which was embarrassing. Two times, (including last night) when he got this drunk, he got really mean, cussed at me, and in the morning didn't remember and felt terrible. The first time, I told him he needed to cut back. I'm not at a point in my life where I want to be dating someone who becomes undependable and mean when drinking (aka not himself). He did cut back (this was in Jan/Feb). Things were totally wonderful, I noticed a difference...until last night.\n\nThis morning I was so mad because apparently the \"cut back\" thing was too general. I was so pissed I almost left the whole relationship, but then he \"came to\"... was himself, and felt terrible just like the last time. I told him how I felt (about the slurring, stumbling, mean-spiritedness only occurring with liquor) and he said, \"ok I trust you, you are right, no whiskey/liquor you don't deserve that.\" \n\nI still feel resentful of the things he said. I'm so confused.. alcoholism was so far from me growing up, I honestly don't know what it looks like. Am I in denial about the liquor only causing this? I feel like if I said no drinking, he would do it, but it'd be too restrictive and he would resent me. Is he an alcoholic? Literally, any input appreciated. I'm in the dark. Thank you.",

And that me messing up my sobriety doesn't surprise him at all and he's just tired of me being this way. I feel like no one I know expects me to ever actually be sober, and they all can't stand me because I always saying I'm going to get sober, and it still hasn't happened. Sometimes I think they wish I'd just stop trying to sober up because the stupid dramatic roller coaster would stop and they wouldn't have to deal with the intense depression I fall into every time I fail. And I get that, because I wish I'd just stop fooling myself and be the crap person they all know I am. Fighting this addiction is exhausting, and telling them \"I drank again\" is so painful. I wish someone in my life would be able to just once make me feel like it's not a big deal when I screw up. I wish I had someone to say \"It's okay. You messed up, but you can get back up and try again.\" I wish it didn't have to feel like the world was ending. I know that's not realistic, but sometimes I feel like the stacking disapproval and disappointment from the people contributes to my relapses.

For me \"doing something\" meant drinking alcohol. Now I actually enjoy the sun and the nice weather instead of getting drunk.\n\nHowever I am surrounded by  people who are not supportive or are just mocking me. My sister who for the longest time has called me an alcoholic, said to me today after I told her I was 23 days sober  \"Counting days is so childish, you have to really want it without counting. You will relapse so hard. Don't talk to me unless you have done at least 6 months\" and I just want to cry because it is the exact wrong thing to say to someone and is making me question the whole thing.\n\nFirst thing my mom asked me was \"Are you doing this to get attention?\" And I was crushed because for the longest time I associated friendship and attention with alcohol and in order to stop I did not go anywhere for 15 days and just recently and very tentatively tried going out. So saying I am doing it for attention made die a bit inside.\n\nMy friends are super supportive and understanding and we joke about my problem but not in an abusive way like with my sister but in a chill way where I am the one making most of the jokes and it is never malicious. What my sister said was downright cruel.",

            "selftext": "Make no mistake, I am a drunk.  I'm 37 and have drank since 18.  I've had periods of sobriety, none longer than 1.5 years.  I've been to rehab; I've attended countless AA meetings; I've taken responsibility; I don't blame anyone but myself and I don't make excuses.  I am an alcoholic and can't stop drinking. \n\nI married my partner 6 years ago.  When I met him, I had *just* started drinking again after a several month stint of sobriety.  We had fun, partied, went to clubs, etc.  I drank to excess then, and worse now.  Over the years, I've tried to explain alcoholism to him.  In short, this included a book on understanding the alcoholic family member, bringing him to a couple AA meetings (he didn't have much interest), hundreds of discussions (which typically ended in arguments), and exposure to other alcoholics with their collective wisdom.   He continues to conclude that I am weak and I have a choice to stop \"if I wanted to\".  My interpretation is that he simply does not understand the power alcoholism holds over me.  I tell him that I'd love to stop drinking, that I know how detrimental it is, that I realize it could have devastating effects on my health and our relationship.  \"So just stop\", is the response I get.  \n\nObviously the dynamics in our relationship are much more complex than I can detail in a post.  So, understand that he is a loving person, I am a loving person, he always looks out for my best interest and vice versa.  It is a healthy relationship with the glaring exception of my alcoholism.  \n\nAside from the obvious answer that I should stop drinking and that will solve all my problems, **here is my reality:** \n\n* He likes to go out and have cocktails, and wants me to have cocktails (albeit only one or two) and gets furious with me when I have more.  Every time, I explain that I can''t.  He doesn't believe this.\n* I drink at home for untold reasons.  He tells me I am weak.  He tells me that it is my choice (is it?).  He gives me ultimatums, for which I reply that I understand.\n   * I am a happy drunk - I drink to get away.  I go into my own world, and watch videos and smile, laugh.  I never get angry, and rarely get sad.  Any confrontation is almost always when he berates me with judgement and callous comments that I can only assume are driven by his inability to comprehend this disease, not by a fault in his character.\n* I am born from a family of alcoholics - so that's fun.  He throws that in my face whenever I go to visit family.  \"Your mother will let you drink, your father likes to drink, have fun, don't come home\".  \n* Oddly, he discusses our lifestyle in a hurtful manner, and this one really makes me bewildered:\n   * When there's cause for argument, he condescendingly states that he is under my control because I am the breadwinner.  I have a good job that pays very well.  I NEVER tell him what to spend or how to spend it, but he will bring this up as if I do.  His profession is difficult and comes and goes.  I am always supportive as money is not an issue, so there is no reason for me to critical of his earnings.  It just doesn't factor with me, but it DOES for him when he wants to make me feel bad about my drinking.  I don't understand the association.  \n\nThere's more.  But this is tiring me out.  If you've lasted to read this post, I am thankful and hopeful to hear your thoughts.",

At any rate, I don't really need advice or encouragement, I'd just like to get some perspective on this thing; Alcohol has always been \"my\" drug. Every other chemical I've exposed myself to has paled in comparison. Even weed is an uncomfortable buzz for me, and I've not smoked in probably three years. But man, alcohol... I've never felt like a real person when I was sober. I've always felt like I was processing the world around me at 120fps while everyone else was seeing 60fps. If I was sober, you could talk to me for 45 minutes and I'd not retain a single thing you said, but put about nine beers in me and I will be more interested in your story than a dude who has had three lines and a pot of coffee. I've done a shitload of drugs, especially downers, but beer is better than all of them. So my question to those of you who are drying out is: How do you go on sober?",

            "selftext": "We have been together 5 years, no kids just yet but that is something we both want in the future. Drinking has always been an issue and I do nag him about it at times. When we first got together he was drinking alot more than he does now...I suppose he cut down because we were having arguments about it and he realised he was over doing it a bit. These days he will either stay sober or have 1 drink from monday to wednesday. Thursday he might have 4 or 5. Friday night he often gets drunk (maybe 5-12 drinks depending), saturday and sunday he will start drinking during the day from midday and often ends up have 4-8 drinks over the course of the afternoon and evening so is a bit tipsy.  If we go out with friends on the weekend he gets drunk but its not all the time. Honestly I love a good drinking session and getting drunk but not every weekend, maybe 1 or 2 times a month, personally I go hard or I go home lol.  I hate it when he is hung over because we can't do fun/active stuff the next day. And if we are driving somewhere on the weekend I have to drive because he will be over the limit. A few times a month he will be hungover for work. He doesnt get in fights anymore and has never had a DUI and he is not abusive. Sometimes he gets  cranky tho but no big deal. Compared to other people his habit is not really that bad but I'm still a bit worried about it. He is a bit overweight and I just wish he would get fitter, its hard for me to be attracted to him. He does go to the gym but really if he cant cut down the alcohol there is no way he will lose weight. He says that drinking is the only time he really feels happy (preexisting depression) and he has an alcoholic mother so alcoholism runs in the family....he also had a rough childhood. I even suggested that antidepressants might work? He went to a counsellor but did not find it helpful. We have nearly broke up a number of times due to our differences of opinion on this topic and I'm not sure if I want to raise kids around this. He reckons when a baby comes along it will motivate him to cut back. But I can't be certain this will actually happen.  I'm really at my wits end with this. I've had some severe problems in my own life which he has definitely helped me deal with but I really don't have the space mentally to be thinking about this issue as well. I'm starting to not care about the situation and have caught myself being a bit too flirty with others which I am ashamed about. I'm seriously considering moving out. I would appreciate any advice.

My dumbass decided to drink last night, and this morning when I went to my car to drive to work, I blew into my ignition interlock and failed. After doing some research and consulting a bunch of different bac calculators, my alcohol level was around a 0.07 by the time I blew. Im desperate, and was wondering if anybody had any possible excuses that have worked in the past for why I would've blown such a high number. I know mouthwash etc. Is only a temporary method of failure, plus it wouldn't get me anywhere near 0.07. Just fyi, not that this helps with my past fuck ups, but after being good for 3 months without 1 drink and fucking up this one time yet again after my DUI, I know i have a problem and fully intend to get the help I need to beat this addiction.

            "selftext": "I\u2019m beyond livid right now. I can\u2019t even think straight I\u2019m so upset. My brother decided to tell my whole family about my addiction instead of focusing on his own addiction, he is a binge drinker and blaming me for everything. He told my sister, mom about my relapse with coke. Now they think I\u2019m headed down the same path. Which I\u2019m working on myself for about 2.5 years now and I\u2019ve overcome a lot even with my relapses.  Anyways he did coke with me too and is acting like I\u2019m an issue, told my sister a lot of stuff I didn\u2019t want her to know. I went off last night again. My mom told me I was an addict and an alcoholic and said I\u2019m going to Alanon so you can\u2019t treat me this way anymore because I was defending myself. My brother gave me a black eye a couple years ago and I got blamed for that as well. I was completely sober when I was talking to  my mom i feel like my family is gaslighting me when I have been open to most everyone about my relapse \ud83d\ude33 a month before my wedding my brother yet again starts drama. He pulled some other stuff back in Christmas and pushed me into a coat hanger. Any advice would be appreciated! I\u2019m about to lose my shit and obviously am not speaking with my family besides my brother and sister. Am I the issue here or is my family bat shit crazy?",

            "selftext": "\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s been a decade under the influence. I started when I was 20. Now at 30, I can\u2019t believe where I am in life.\n\nI\u2019m facing an OVI charge. My final jury trial date is May 30th. It looks like they\u2019re going to throw the book at me. I have a very aggressive attorney but he doesn\u2019t seem to have much hope left for winning the case. I haven\u2019t even dug the courage up yet to go watch the video. Luckily I didn\u2019t blow, but I know if I did it would be at least over double. I fell asleep behind the wheel and wrecked my truck into another car. At least no one was hurt.\n\nI am also single, chronically single. Unable to attract anyone, for years now. Even if someone shows some interest, they soon come to find out that I would rather spend my nights at a bar alone, than with them. Maybe it\u2019s for the best that I pursue no one. At least that\u2019s one less person to let down. My dick barely works anymore, anyway. Thanks, whiskey.\n\nI don\u2019t remember the last time I had an ambition or goal. My day to day is avoiding thinking about my debt, upcoming criminal conviction, and my loneliness. I stopped trying to imagine a life I enjoyed. I stopped thinking one day I would have all my debt paid off and $30,000 in a savings account. I stopped dreaming of day not living paycheck to paycheck. It\u2019s so debilitating because I make a lot of money, but most of it goes to the car, the credit cards, all maxed out, the consolidation loan, the student loans, rent, booze. I\u2019m a contractor at my office so I don\u2019t even have stabilizing things like health insurance or a 401k. Oh, and I found out I owe $1400 to the IRS. Late fees and penalties. All a day in the life, for me. \n\nFriends are the same. Only bar friends. Regulars too dipped in the dark that the idea of meeting up outside of the bar makes no sense. They care, in their way, but we\u2019re all the same. We\u2019re all lost. Some worse than others. \n\nI don\u2019t know how I haven\u2019t lost my job yet. I\u2019m pretty sure everyone knows I have a bit of a drinking problem, but I get my work done on time so they let it pass. If they only knew I spend almost all my down time with some kind of bottle or glass in my hand. \n\nI\u2019m just a loser. I\u2019ve spent a decade ruining my life. I\u2019m a shell of the former kid I was in art school, wanting to do something meaningful with my life. Wanting to find a wife and marry her and have children. Raise children. Now I know I\u2019ll never have that life, I don\u2019t deserve it. I would just make anyone who is close to me miserable. I\u2019ve accepted this nihilism.\n\nI don\u2019t even want happiness, because like drink, it\u2019s just the moment before you need more happiness. I would like meaning. Purpose. A family. A legacy. I\u2019ll never have that, not while I still live like a 21 year old college student. \n\nI don\u2019t even know if I want to stop. I\u2019ll probably end up back at the bar tonight. Hell, the Jackets are playing the Bruins tomorrow night, Stanley Cup. It\u2019s a huge deal for my city, and I\u2019ll probably get drunk watching the game with my \u201cfriends.\u201d It seems every day there\u2019s a reason.\n\nI just feel hopeless.\n\nI just feel so tired. Life is so exhausting. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t have anything else to say. I\u2019m just sad. I could use a real friend.",

Some nights I\u2019ll have one and maybe 1 night in the week I\u2019ll have none.\n\nI have a very strong mind, in a sense that if I wanted to not drink for a certain amount of time, I could do it, but obviously I\u2019d be bored at night if no one is around.\n\nThe reason I\u2019m asking and why I feel guilty is because, i just feel bad having to consume something every night (most) in order to enjoy watching tv that night or just go to sleep easy.\n\nIf I really wanted to I could stop all together. \n\nMost people say that if it becomes a problem in other aspects of your life, like family, friends, work, study, then it\u2019s an issue. - but I only drink when everyone\u2019s sleeping or in bed at like 10pm and it\u2019s usually maximum 3 drinks. \n\nI am fit and I workout every second day. \n\nI\u2019ll once again say, I do not drink in the day.\n\nIs something wrong? - is this bad? Obviously it\u2019s a slippery slope and I know this, but should I feel guilty for having these habits. \n\n\nSorry for the long read.",

I want to help and I don\u2019t want this to last forever.

I feel guilty because I know he will take every reason to drink and I really needed a break. \n\nHow do I start the conversations.

My greatest problem over the last few weeks has been insomnia. I waited until 8 am and no sleep, and an overall feeling of doom.\nI'm fine now, after I took a couple of shots. My alarm is set to 6 hours from now so I can take care of some stuff related to my business.\nI know you're say it's fake and that I'll have to pay with debts for this feeling \"tomorrow\". I couldn't agree more with you. But right now, just not feeling that I should hang myself but without having the willpower to do it feels really great.\nSorry for the rant.\nLast week was an alcohol-free week, with a LOT of work and since Monday I've been drinking a lot as a \"present\" for myself. Ridiculous, I know. This resulted in me texting awkward emails for my manager and for my account assistant, who kinda said she doesn't want to work with me anymore (nothing sexual, I'm gay, I just started ranting about my life without any context).",

It's hard to admit that to myself for some reason, and even harder to tell others. Everything is going right in my life, but for some reason I can't stay off the booze. I drink a fifth of vodka every night and it gets me to a slight buzz so I can at least fall asleep. I drink before I go to class, I drink before I see my friends or my family, and I drank before I attended church 2 days ago. I have a term paper due in 15 hours. I haven't started it yet. I just finished my vodka. I don't know if I should try to write it now even though I'm drunk, or if I should wait until I have a clear mind, but a broken body. I've had enough. I want to stop. I'm going into tomorrow with a positive attitude and a lot of prayers. I want to wish anyone out there going through the same thing to be strong and be well.",

So, one day I quit. I didn't know it then, but I was going through a mid life crisis and for the next couple of years it was and is a rollercoaster ride of depression, drinking, self loathing and despair. I can go weeks without drinking and I feel really good and then, for no reason at all, I'll start drinking. Usually only for a day or so, but it still manages to screw things up. I'm usually so sick afterwards I can't get out of bed which causes me to miss work. I just started at a new company where everyone is very supportive. They don't know what I am going through. My wife of 13yrs works there as well. The last thing I want to do is make her look bad. I lie to myself that I can have a few drinks and get up and go to work the next day. Never happens. I really like this job and don't want to lose it. I can't afford to. Just thought I'd share.",

Even went a year without drinking. \n\nNow it\u2019s been a year where we\u2019ve get drunk every night after work, wake up hungover, puke a lot, go to work, rinse, repeat. \n\nWe are actively looking for AA meetings to attend, detox programs etc. the worst of it is with withdrawals.\n\nI\u2019ve read a lot about tapering down with beer to get through the worst of it (ie trying not to have seizures) but we know that\u2019s not a solution.\n\nIs this is right way to go?

On top of that I obsessively fap to porn and snort drugs which makes it even worse. It takes me a week or more to recover physically and mentally after.\n\n\nWhat my drinking does to me:\n1. I stop going to gym and making progress, very often have to spend another week or two to get back on track\n2. Making me to seek drugs and porn which leads to the next point\n3. Making my depression and anxiety much worse\n4. Damaging my health, so far I didn't develop anything permanent\n5. I lost my job many times\n6. Depriving me from ambitions and goals or having any hobbies\n7. Making stupid decisions, calling people while drunk not even remembering\n8. Losing stuff, like mobile phones\n9. Falling down the stairs few months ago breaking my wrist\nand so on...\n\nAll that just for few hours of happiness? Why do we tend to forget the consequences?

            "selftext": "My dad is in his 60's and is an alcoholic.  He has anywhere from 15-20 drinks a day.  He is a diabetic who has had heart issues.  He is in sales and is making $0.....but then he is in amazing shape, works out all the time, eats healthy, has a beautiful home, fun family life etc.\n\nSo my mom, brothers and I are really struggling with how to approach this.  He is not doing rock bottoms things that would make most people want to change.  No abuse, public embarrassment , no endangering other people etc..My mom is a fixer and is the main breadwinner so he never faces real life consequences for his drinking.  He has offended a few clients and can't seem to make any sales since the job is from home and he is drunk doing it.  He is an amazing fixer upper and prefers to putter around the house fixing things, walking the dog, working out...drinking.. \n\nThe ramifications are things like; my mom not being attracted to him when he's drinking, us kids finding him silly or not respecting him, my mom having to work super hard in her 60's to support them, all of us worrying a lot about his health and the effect of long time alcohol abuse etc... \n\nWe are all also enablers who like to have a good time so the alcohol is flowing when we get together.\n\nMy two biggest questions are (a) Is it worth it trying to make him do the HUGE life change when he is not *that bad?* and (b) should we worry about his health even more if tried to quit since his body is chemically dependent?\n\nSorry for the long post...any advice or comments are welcome...we are pretty new to trying to take all of this stuff more seriously.\n\nThanks :)",

He\u2019d recently come back in contact like this. He\u2019d been sober before, but suffered some family tragedies and is now homeless and back to drinking. I was too ill with the flu to do anything, but told my partner what was going on and he spent 6+ hours getting him into detox (guy was not not resistant, just a mess and it was quite the process). Reading about the difficulties of detox, I worry and feel for him. Is there anything else we can do or arrange for him in detox for his aid and comfort? Or is that all that can be done for now? How long do people typically stay in such facilities? Thanks for your help, and good luck to all of you who are struggling.",

I found this really strange as he's never been one to ask my permission for anything. I figured he meant it as permission to be away from me on a night that we usually reserve for date night. I can side step for a wedding event, no big deal. But now I'm worried it was asking permission to drink way too much. I tried talking to him about it and he just said \"it's a bachelor's party, you drink, that's what you do, so I'm going to drink and I'll be home by 2am\". But he made it clear he wasn't going to limit himself at all. I'm really concerned because he was previously sober for 3 months, but in the month of April he's gotten drunk 2 times already and this will make 3. So he's transitioning from not drinking to drinking once a week or so. I'm just looking long term and seeing it becoming a nightly think again. What should I do? I think he should go to the party to be with his friends but I don't think he should go if it means he'll be drinking.",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone, this is my first reddit post ever so I will try to do my best to explain this situation. So I have been with my gf for about 2 years now and am so in love with her. She is just a lovely person, beautiful inside and out. The first time I met her I was at a party with friends and she was pretty blackout drunk. We ended up hooking up but kicked it off. I have personally never been a big drinker but can have a beer or two with friends without losing my control. My gf on the other hand just cannot put down the bottle as soon as she starts. Flash forward about a year and a half and all the sudden things are much worse. She ended up working at a bar, turning 21 not too long ago and I had a feeling in my gut she was going to start losing any control she had left. So a couple of weeks ago, she went on a bad binger, about a week long. She would never talk to me on the phone, because she knew I could tell by her voice she had been drinking. She wouldnt talk to her family, friends or myself and just went off the map. That is until I get a call at the end of that binge week with her saying \u201cI am an alcoholic, I need help, you were right all along\u201d. To make matters worse she ran out of money and started using her family\u2019s credit card to buy alcohol and when her mom asked about the statement she blamed it on me. I took that pretty well, even though I know it was a horrible thing to have someone do to you especially with it being my GF being the one throwing me under the bus. I know this is a disease and she can\u2019t help it so I forgive her to try and level with the lack of control in her life. She has had a rough life and troubling past which I always am willing to talk with her about. Lately she has been calling me at the earliest hours of the morning begging me to come over just to be with her because she says I make her feel better. All the while, I feel empty, this is the first girl I have ever been in love with and I cannot help but feel like I am not doing enough. When I arrive to see her, she is angry, emotionally unstable and constantly shifting her mood. She will attack me, make me do things for her and I just take it hoping she will see what kind of person she has become. I wonder if she has done things behind my back and I know she has lied to me in the past about where she is or if she has been drinking. All in all, I love this girl to death but I am being pushed into a position of whether or not I cut my losses or try and work with her on this in the best way that I can. I have a great deal of patience when it comes to allowing a person to become better but only when I know they are committed to helping themselves. How do I go about getting the girl that I love back? Because right now, she is a shadow of what once was a bright light in my life. She has refused AA meetings as she \u201cdoesnt want to be one of those people that goes to meetings\u201d. I do not enable her to drink around me and she knows that but my heart is just breaking every time a day goes by where we dont talk and I know exactly what she is doing with her time. Her grades in school are slipping, her family seems to just be fine with her drinking herself to death unsupervised, but I just feel like I can\u2019t give up on the people I love. I have a soft spot in my heart for people I truely connect with and she is one of the few people that I have ever met where I can say I want a future involving us building a family and getting back to the great past few years we have had. She has told me before all of this happened completely sober so I know she loves me too. I would really appreciate any advice and if there is any information that I can tell that would help with a solution feel free to ask. I just want the one I love back and if I could have one wish in life right now it would be for her to stop destroying what a great life we could be spending together. Thank you for your time reading this, I know I am a bit of a sap when it comes to this but its just the first thing I worry about in the morning and the last thing I worry about before bed.",

            "selftext": "I know what alcohol does to me, I know how it makes me feel, I know the aftermath of it. 60 percent of my problems stem from a night after drinking and that leads to deep depression. Which is crazy to hear that someone knows what their problem is and how it stems out but they continue to do it, almost as if they are making the conscious decision to continue doing the thing that makes them suffer.  You hear time and time again the constant battle of addiction is a \"disease\" or its a \"choice\" the terrifying thing about it is that it's honestly both. I have chose to let this disease take over, it has been passed down to me by both parents, as hard as I fight it, it always seems to win. I enjoy the feeling of being inebriated but its the feeling after that makes me feel empty, pained, lonely even and that continues the cycle to where I need to drink again to feel good about myself as I feel my inhibitions lower and my gut raise. I'm not creating this post for pity. I am creating this post to to feel as though I'm not alone in this struggle.",

You\u2019re going to stop where you are, fix it, and keep going. This helped me in dealing with my relapses. The time you\u2019ve had sober and the things you\u2019ve learned aren\u2019t lost.
