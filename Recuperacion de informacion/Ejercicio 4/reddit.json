            "selftext": "I was bullied for having a lot of acne by these 2 assholes when I was in middle school. Let\u2019s call them \u201cJack\u201d and \u201cJake\u201d. Now, Jake was the ringleader and Jack would just follow him around and listen to whatever he said. I used to really sensitive about my acne because no one else in my grade had it as bad as me, thankfully most of my real friends didn\u2019t care and were nice enough. \n\nJack and Jake would do things like take pictures of me and laugh behind my back, point to each pimple then just laugh like it was a joke. I asked them to stop many times over and over but they just didn\u2019t get it. They would edit pictures together and make videos with music and voiceovers making fun of my face and show it to other people. Middle school was a very bad time for me in general, I wanted to never go to school and deal with them every again. I felt very depressed and anxious most days. \n\nI was generally liked by most people so then trying to get more people to bully me wasn\u2019t really a big deal but the problem was in 8th grade, I had all 8 classes with Jake, who as I mentioned before was the ringleader. He would do whatever he could to ruin my day and make it hell. \n\nNow, I\u2019m a fairly chill person so I am cool with jokes between friends and roasting each other for fun, but these two guys genuinely wanted to ruin my life so one day I started crying in school for the first time and I lost it. \n\nI went to my counselor who was very empathetic and told she was also bullied for having a lot of acne as well. I explained in detail, how for over two years, they basically made my life hell. She then called Jake and Jack to the main office and had a talk with them for around half hour each. (I had told her they kept all the pictures and videos on their google drive so it was easy to prove my complaint). \n\nAfter chatting with each one, she called me in and let me decide what punishment each of them should receive since they basically ruined two years of my life. In my heart, I knew that Jake was the actual \u201cbad guy\u201d and Jack had been badly influenced. I was still really pissed at both of them since they ruined all of my middle school basically. \n\nI asked my counselor if a 3 day suspension was reasonable and a letter to their parents. She said that was in the ballpark and then got verification from administration. I also didn\u2019t want to deal with them so i asked if I could never have classes with either of them. She said that was a given and I shouldn\u2019t have to ever worry about them again. Now, I don\u2019t think I mentioned this before, but we are all Asian so any misbehavior from kids makes Asian parents very angry, which I why I also wanted a letter to their parents.\n\nWhen they came back, each of them gave me a very big apology and then we moved on. I never socialized with them for the rest of 8th grade and was able to enjoy my life for the first time in years. When we got to high school, they didn\u2019t try to bother me and we just generally stayed separate.\n\nI was a senior this past year. Jake and Jack had still been friends for this whole time and thought it would be all right to bully me again during the spring of our senior year since we would graduate in less than a month. \n\nI wasn\u2019t going to put up with this bullshit again so I just went and told my high school counselor who had been briefed about my problem by my old middle school counselor. She had a talk with each of them and gave them an ISS(In School Suspension) for 2 days. \n\nWhen it came time to apply for college, I was a relatively smart guy so I was able to thankfully get into the Medical Program at John Hopkins University, which was my dream college.\n\nNow, Jake and Jack had in total, 5 days of suspension each. Like mentioned before, they were Asian and it was expected they go to a good college. They were both only accepted at our local community college, since most good colleges don\u2019t want students with multiple counts of suspension on their record.\n\nNow, I want to say that going to a local community college is not bad, but Asian children are kept at a very high standard by their parents, even the ones living in America.\n\nI was pretty satisfied when I graduated high school and was able to ensure the bullies would never think about bullying me or anyone ever again.\n\nSorry for the long read, hope you liked the revenge! \n\nTLDR: 2 kids bully me for over 2 years for my biggest insecurity, my acne. I got them both suspended in middle school and in high school. Later on, they were not accepted into good colleges and had to go to community college.",

            "selftext": "This one will have a long background but please stay with me. It is all very important to the outcome. \n\nFor some info about me, I am currently 18 as of the date of this being posted and my brother is 16. I currently commute to college and live with my mother and step-dad to save money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom a bio-father got separated in mid to late 2006 when I was 6 hyears old and my brother was 3. He doesn't remember much but I remember after my bed time my parents would fight and argue in the kitchen. I didn't know what it was about but I know now it was about how my bio-father would do nothing but jerk off and drink coffee all day long while my mom worked 60 - 80 hours a week at 3 different jobs  (shes an MRI tech) to support me and my brother and keep the house. This apparently when on for YEARS before the divorce. Eventually thye settled in court and my bio-father was granted the weekends with me and my brother at his place (he moved back in with his parents; who are total assholes and I do not speak to them to this day, but thats a story for another post). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis works fine for about a year until my dad gets a place of his own, a pretty shitty apartment around the corner from his parnets. Well, one weekend he apparently left me and my brother alone, we were 8 and 5, to go DOWN THE STREET AT 10PM to buy cigarets and soup. When my mom found out she brought him back to court for this, and not paying child support. The Judge was PISSED at my bio-father. He apparently screamed at my dad, \"IF YOU **EVER** LEAVE THOSE KIDS ALONE AGAIN **YOU WILL NEVER** GET THE CHANCE TO SEE THEM AGAIN!! DO YOU UNERSTAND THAT Mr. \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ ?!\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter this we continued to see him every weekend (my mom decided me and my brother needed a father figure in our lives and did not have him put in jail for not paying child support, which was $50 per child mind you...). I would call my mom from my first cell phone nearly EVERY weekend leaving her voice mails of me crying about how much I hated being at my bio-fathers and how he would always yelling at me. I hated being there. However, my brother was always treated like a god. He got whatever he wanted, whenever he wanted it. This still continues to this day. If I even wanted to go and see the local war ships (Battleships and destroyers that was a 15 minute drive, 20 with traffic, it was an immediate \"No\" from my bio-father, but when my little brother wanted to go to somewhere 45+ minutes away, it was always \"Get your shoes on, OP we'll be back later\". I was always very upset by this but I knew it wasn't my brothers fault. Me and my brother do not get along well, even today, but we both realize that it is because of my bio-father that ruined it for us. There was some minor abuse that I admit I sort of provoked but the mental and emotional abuse was the worst.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe years pass and all of this continues until I am 15. I can no longer take the verbal and mental abuse of my bio-father and tell him I will no longer spend every weekend, but instead every other saturday. He was angrier than I'v ever seen him bit he reluctantly accepted because I was of the age that I could make up my own mind about these things. The favoritism continued in favor of my little bro and it hurt worse and worse every time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***This is where I start to plan my revenge against him.*** Over the next 2 hyears or so I slowly start to get my revenge, small piece by small piece at a time. I talke dwith my mom and found out all of the above info aboiut the divorce through several journals she kept hidden from my dad detailing all of the graphic things he said and did to her, me and my bro, and my mom's parents. I learned that He hadn't payed a single penny of child support and alos learned that me and my mom could garnish his military disability cheacks. So we make sure the state has this done and we finally start getting vhecks from him for the custody of me and my brother. I also find out he is dating someone. I find her on FaceBook and create a new account to message her warning her of what he is. she reads all of the messages but never responds.  2 weeks later he was single and living on his own with no car because it was in her name. The next part of my revenge was to make sure **EVERYONE** knew who he was. So I sent his boss a message telling him about my bio-father's previous job in that industry and why he was fired. I won't go inot detail but he was basically caught stealing money from accounts. His new boss did not know this and thanked me for the information and being honest. He said he would not mention my name in the paper work or to my bio-father for the reason for why he was being fired. He finds a new job somehow and buys a ***brand new truck*** (a ford f150 that was, granted, 2 or 3 years old but had low miles on it). I fin out the tital must not be in his name because my mom tried to get the full, court ordered, child support amount for my brother (I had turned 18 by this time). I sent a letter to the state and the DMV to find out he also did not have a valid drivers licence. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI should mention that this is about the extent of the legal revenge as of right now. **BUT......**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere were a few good moments with my bio-father. We talked about cars and motorcycles often enough to form some sort of loose bond together. So, because my bio-father very rarely had a job until I was about 16 or 17, I worked from 15 (with working papers) as much as I could and saved everything I had to buy not one, but 2 motorcycles over the course of a year. He loves to ride but never had the money to buy one after my brother was born. At 18 I payed for my own riding classes, my own bikes, and my own car / motorcycle insurance. Not only this, but my bio-father also loved Subaru WRX / WRX STi's. For those who dont know these are 4-door sedans with higher performance engines than the regular Subaru Impreza. So, recently I found a new job that pays $20.00 and recently made a large downpayment on it along with some minor upgrades. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust before writing this I finnally got the guts to tell him off over the phone. I told him I knew everything he did to my family and I was not having any of him anymore. I also told him I am hanging my name to my grandftahers name (they HATE eachother), I have everything he wanted in life, I will not be inviting him to my wedding when I get married and I will not be speaking to him until he not only pays me and my brothe the money he owns us, but also until everyone on my mothers side of the family recieve a personalized, typed apology letter in the mail. He was silent for a moment and then just started yelling at me, telling me how I would never amount to anything, how I would never \"be successful like him\" and how I better take back everything I said or he will make sure everyone knows who I really am. I hung up before he could say anything else and blocked his phone number. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm sorry this is so long but I felt it was important for any one who reads this post understands my situation. There is SOOOO much more I did not wrte hre but I do not feel like sitting here for hours writting a post that would take 2 hours to read.",

            "selftext": "Hey reddit users, I don\u2019t know if this would be \u201cProRevenge\u201d or \u201cPettyPeople\u201d petty being me! This story is from years ago when I was in 8th grade, but that doesn\u2019t make it blurry at all. I\u2019ll just up front name characters. I\u2019ll call my friend Brad and the bad guy Tyler (I think that\u2019s all I need to mention but if not I\u2019ll add more details) I\u2019ll start this off by mentioning I\u2019m a girl, maybe that will help so you know what voice to make while reading in your head. Lol. So ill now start the story. I was at school one day opening my locker to put my stuff away as Brad came up to me, me and brad go all the way back to first grade. He was my first crush and everything and we had always been best friends, no distance or moving could ever change that. I would pretty much do anything to help him because by then he was like family to me. So when he came up to me he had a smug look on his face so I knew something was up. Brad said to me \u201cyou see that kid over there?\u201d Gesturing to Tyler. I said yeah, (I didn\u2019t really know Tyler at the time he was in 2 of my classes and we had mutual friends but something seemed off about him so I kept my distance.) of course Brad wanted something to do with this kid. I guess Tyler was getting on Brads nerves or something because he asked for a favor, and I never say no to a favor, little did I know this was gunna start hell for me. Brad asked me if I could mess with Tyler, not in a sexual way or anything more like psychological. I said sure knowing this wouldn\u2019t be hard, and I was right, it wasn\u2019t hard. I became Tyler\u2019s friend, gained his trust. No I wasn\u2019t just gunna start up and do something then, it was gunna take a bit. (Let me add, at this time I was with a guy who wasn\u2019t very nice to me, I\u2019ll call him Charlie. Charlie will appear again later) I kind of started to enjoy Tyler\u2019s company. It was nice, I felt like I was kinda actually cared for a bit. We had science and English together (sadly our science teacher was his aunt) so since we had the same friend group it was easy for us to all sit together. We even went to the movies once which was nice. I thought the friend shit was going well... but I was wrong. One day in science Tyler changed my life permanently. I can\u2019t be the same because my mind just won\u2019t let me. I know you question what happened. And the best way I could put it is Tyler decided it would be okay to start touching me inappropriately though I kept telling him to stop. There was a witness, but the teacher didn\u2019t care because I mean it was her niece. He wouldn\u2019t do such thing. I reported it to the principal and guidance but knew nothing would be done. So I decided to do my own revenge. (You may ask why didn\u2019t I tell my parents, well I did... she didn\u2019t believe me and my dad only agrees with her) my revenge was honestly simple, it was an easy take and leave plan. I went back acting like everything was okay and normal (honestly the hardest thing for me to do, especially cuz I\u2019m that time I had recently lost my dog) I decided to take his friends one by one. It wasn\u2019t hard. I told them what happened and thank god the witness was one of the hottest and most liked guys at our school, so they believed me (well I mean I wasn\u2019t lying to them) and no that wasn\u2019t bad. Tyler hated me so much for what I did, but did he ever think what he did and how it effected me? I don\u2019t hug people or touch people anymore, I can\u2019t be touched at all it scares me, I only let a couple people hug me and it\u2019s hard to get in that spot. I have awful trust issues and everything. I definitely bottled that rage into something worse. High school came and Tyler thought we were all good again. Hilarious, but I went with it. It didn\u2019t even take a week for me to find the right people to make him pay. Of course I wasn\u2019t going to do anything because that would make me look like a bad person but these people were corrupted and everyone knew to not mess with them. I told them what had happened, and that day his face was introduced to the urinal. Once word got around that Tyler touches little girls (I was never mentioned and the story changed after a while, not because of me but it was like a game of telephone. It doesn\u2019t come back the same) everyone wanted to hurt him. He was beat up 2-3 times a week, lost all his friends again and was left with nothing. It got so bad they had to move to another state. And that\u2019s kind of the end of the story I guess, I know I sound like a crap person and all, but what he did was awful. He knew I was raped as a child and I had trust in him and him just doing that to me blew it all away. Thanks for reading and have a great night/day",

            "selftext": "  \n\nLong time reader, first revenge story. Warning, this is extremely long winded.  \n TL;DR: Former manager is an ass and I was in it for the long game.\n\nI graduated college right when the recession hit us hard in summer of 2009 and I was desperate for a job. After months of searching and desperation, I finally landed a gig at a small outdoor recreation shop that serviced the nation (I know, sounds weird). It\u2019s a niche recreation shop and I don\u2019t want to say it directly as it would be easy to pinpoint who I am. The manager who hired me was a pretty cool and relaxed dude and we hit it off. Let me tell you, this job was grueling \u2013 retail, small staff, and since it was a fairly open facility; No A/C. This was the summer of over 100 days with over 100 degree weather. However, I enjoyed the work and learned a lot about life. I worked every weekend (hooray retail), with one or two days off Mon-Fri.\n\nGood manager taught me everything he knew, and challenged me to continue learning everything we carried as well as things we didn\u2019t carry to be helpful to our customers, after all, we were the experts in our field. Unfortunately for me, the good manager eventually was transferred to the head facility and a new manager was hired \u2013 an outsider named Ash (Name changed). Ash thought his $h!t didn\u2019t stink and he was the best manager ever\u2026he had 3 employees, including me. I was the only other full time employee which made me unofficially the assistance manager because I did all the tasks the manager did when he was out, the other two were part time college students with limited schedules. So Ash and I ended up working together a lot. \n\nLet me help you imagine Ash: if you can, imagine a 1980\u2019s greased back hair car salesman, much like Don Ready from *The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Trying*\u2026that\u2019s Ash, except older, with greased hair with balding spot and all. He\u2019s a creepy, mid-40\u2019s bachelor, career salesman, who has never had a girlfriend last longer than a year, on dates (which I heard him boast about on many occasions) he was sexist and degrading.  Ash took this job from across the nation and his background was definitely not in outdoor recreation \u2013 but he was a damn fine salesman, his only redeeming \u201cquality\u201d. His only possession was his pride and joy: a supped up Dodge Ram SRT-10 (known as the Viper from here on out, it was a limited edition 2 year run Viper edition pickup truck). He often gloated about his lack of material items \u201cso it\u2019s easy to move around\u201d and would mock me for what possessions I owned (broke college kid trying to make a living), yet would routinely complain about his back hurting because he slept on a futon. \n\nWe never saw eye to eye, I was 22 and looked out for the customer\u2019s best interest, he was mid 40\u2019s and wanting to squeeze every nickel out of the customer that he could. By this point in my tenure at the company, I had established myself a reliable employee to both upper management (another major city away) and customers alike, was sought out for advice by coworkers and customers nationwide. Ash noticed this and tried to \u201ctake me under his wing\u201d and produce his little prot\u00e9g\u00e9. He \u201ctaught\u201d me the best way to help a potential customer is to hang by closely \u2013 \u201cwork\u201d by wiping down products \u2013 so I could eavesdrop on their conversation to look for a way in and \u201cseal the deal\u201d. Ugh, I hated that behavior in salesmen. \n\nA few weeks later he asked me, \u201cOP, do you like to read?\u201d   \n \u201cYea, I don\u2019t read as much as I should but I enjoy a good book.\u201d   \n \u201cGreat, I\u2019ve got a good one for you!\u201d   \n He pulls out Dale Carnegie\u2019s infamous self-help book *How to Win Friends &amp; Influence People.*   \n \u201cYou should really read this, it\u2019ll be good for you.\u201d  \n \u201cGee, thanks.\u201d  \n You\u2019re a real piece of work Ash. I\u2019ve got friends. I\u2019m in a happy committed relationship. You\u2026you filthy piece of distended rectum have nothing!  \n\nWhen he noticed I didn\u2019t take his wisdom to heart and upsell everything, he backlashed in petty ways that he could. OP is off today and we had pallets of products being delivered? Let\u2019s call him in to unload by hand (pallet jack/fork lift did not exist for this company), price all items, and restock the store. OP is off today and I\u2019m overwhelmed with customers? Let\u2019s call him in regardless of where he is! OP is on vacation? Let\u2019s ruin it or deny it! It was horrendous. Would he return the favor when he was scheduled off? Never. I remember clearly calling him when we had a full 53\u2019 trailer to unload and I was by myself with customers. \u201cOh sorry, I can\u2019t come in, today is my day to do laundry.\u201d Okay, gloves off. I was done. Most of his behavior was petty things I could overlook, but when I sacrifice everything for this company, my health, and you\u2026I\u2019m done. \n\nI had friends at our main offices whom I reached out to and was told I had to essentially suck it up. Ash technically hadn\u2019t done anything wrong and his numbers were superb! He constantly landed huge ticket items and large purchases. What went unnoticed was that he checked out a number of my sales (we didn\u2019t work on commission so it didn\u2019t matter to me before), many of his sales were one shot sales \u2013 customers didn\u2019t return \u2013 and some even processed refunds. So in the long run, my sales were more frequent with repeat customers, albeit smaller, and I had roughly 60% of the total sales of 4-5 people. Upper management hated the guy because he was annoying (they weren\u2019t blind to that because they hated dealing with him) but couldn\u2019t terminate him based on that\u2026so I had to be the bigger person. \n\nFine, I\u2019ll play dirty then. New email address, email the main company email as a concerned customer to complain about Ash\u2019s poor customer service behavior, claim I won\u2019t return. I\u2019d monitor Ash\u2019s encounters with customers and would focus on potential issues he\u2019d blow off. Once or twice a week or so I\u2019d send in a complaint from a new email. Just to get his muddy deeds on the head offices\u2019 radar. He would get sent the emails with an \u201cExplain this\u201d prompt. He started sweating and would charm his way out. I never sent anything too horrible, just anonymous complaints.\n\nHe had all of the qualities of a bad manager. Took credit for others work and successes, never showed appreciation or congratulated successes (unless it was a major sale that he wasn\u2019t able to swipe), micromanaged every aspect, he was a control freak, rarely provided clear or realistic instructions, wouldn\u2019t listen or accept feedback, lacked humility, wouldn\u2019t fully follow through or recognize his own responsibilities. I think maybe this was his first managerial job, and it was obvious why he should have remained a worker. Great sales, poor leadership. Why else would you accept a dumpy retail manager position across the nation for one store of 5 employees?\n\nIt finally came to a head a few months later in Summer of 2010. My parents were going to Colorado and Wyoming in about a month or so and decided to invite me along. Ash denied my request \u201cWe\u2019re going to be really busy then.\u201d Yet, he decided he would take a day off to decompress whenever. \n\nNext day, I was assisting an elderly gentleman who had purchased a kayak and needed a way to haul it in his truck. Ash convinced him he needed to purchase the mac daddy kayak holder for the guys\u2019 truck (Maybe $700?) with the load assist to get up 6-7 feet above the ground\u2026blah blah blah. Of course Ash couldn\u2019t be bothered to help him install it\u2026\u201dOP, go install this on his truck!\u201d Sure why not, gets me out of the store for a bit and away from Ash. We had some difficulty putting it on and I could tell the buyer was getting frustrated. I convinced him to get a simpler piece of equipment that only cost $90 that went into trailer hitch, and the kayak only needed to be lifted 3-4 feet off the ground, which he could do with ease. Buyer was relieved! We went inside, swapped equipment and did a refund of the difference. He thanked me for saving him $600 and said he\u2019d be back to get his wife a kayak! Cool! Win-Win in my eyes.\n\nWhen buyer left, Ash stared at me with such disgust, as if I had punched his deceased mother. When the store emptied, he unleashed some of the worst verbal lashings that he could. At that point I decided, eff it. I\u2019m done. Next day, here\u2019s my two weeks\u2019 notice. Called up my parents and said \u201cHey! I\u2019m quitting my job! Am I still able to go with you guys to Colorado and Wyoming? Tickets bought that day. Parents were worried for me because I did not have another job lined up but they understood. \n\nAsh, on the other hand, acted blindsided, how could I just abandon him? Don\u2019t care. Go eff yourself mate. He purposefully ignored me those two weeks which were the best weeks ever.\n\nI know you\u2019re wondering\u2026where\u2019s the pro revenge? I\u2019m not done yet. Like I said, this is very, very long winded.\n\nRemember how petty Ash could be? Three times during my tenure with him, he had a friend of his that he\u2019d send into the store to purchase something when he was out and I was working, and pay in pennies and nickels. We\u2019re talking $20-$40 worth of purchases in change at the last hour of the day. Fine by me. I\u2019m here until closing time, and store policy is I can\u2019t leave until all customers are gone\u2026let\u2019s count it. Oops, lost count. Oh man, you distracted me, gotta start over. So now I\u2019m in overtime, Ash\u2019s dumbass friends got tired of that prank real quick, and now Ash had to send me home/come in late later in the week, and boy did he hate that. It was a satisfying little petty victory before I left.\n\nNow, I\u2019m free of Ash the Asshole\u2026or so I thought.\n\nI went on my trip and had the best vacation in a long time. I had been unemployed maybe 2-3 weeks? I\u2019m in a car traveling from Denver, CO to Cheyenne, WY and I get a phone call from the Vice President (VP) of my former company. That\u2019s weird. \n\n\u201cHey, OP, have you found a new job yet?\u201d  \n \u201cI don\u2019t really want to tell you, but no. I haven\u2019t found a new job yet\u201d  \n \u201cLook, Ash is in the hospital. He had a pulmonary embolism that nearly killed him. He\u2019s going to be out for some time and we need an interim manager.\u201d  \n \u201cLet\u2019s talk about a raise then\u2026\u201d\n\nWhen I returned from my trip, I returned to the store a happy man. Ash was gone, I was in charge and making more money (still peanuts). My coworkers were excited to have me back, we changed a lot of things to ease, yet increase productivity, busted our butts to make amazing sales, and re-establish proper procedures that Ash had\u2026altered. \n\nAsh was out of the store for 2-3 months and I was not looking forward to his return. I knew I needed to find a new job, but the recession was still not kind to us at this point. Ash finally came back, and he had changed\u2026into a nicer, considerate person? It\u2019s amazing what a life threatening accident will do to your behavior.  \n\nAsh\u2019s supper charged Viper pickup was routinely in the shop, and it could only be serviced by a specialty Dodge location about an hour and a half away. Every month or two it was in the shop for yet ANOTHER repair. So Ash made the sensible decision to purchase a new vehicle (while keeping his Viper pickup) and got an 18 year old Nissan pickup (now dubbed the taco truck) with 220,000 miles on the speedometer and a camper over the bed. Overall, not a terrible vehicle, but the exact opposite of his other one. He was still sleeping on the futon. Apparently he spent all his money on hats to cover his balding tendencies, a private garage for his Viper truck, and repairs to his \u201cmakes the ladies wet\u201d waste of a vehicle. Why not sell the supped up, finicky, only one shop can fix it, expensive Viper pickup? But whatever. The kicker, he used one of those old school red Clubs on the steering wheel to prevent theft. I got a good chuckle out of that. \n\nWell, a snake in the grass can only hide for so long. His true colors came back, but I never let down my guard.  \n\nWe had a show every quarter (boat show, demonstration days at the lake, etc) and he would always be the poster boy and would say anything to get the sale remember? Well, he would have me at the store to ACTUALLY sell the items, and get them on their way. One important thing that is essentially required, but not included are tie down straps for kayaks. I would try to sell them and customers would say, \u201cOh, Ash said you\u2019d take care of it\u201d. I\u2019m sorry what? I couldn\u2019t give out product for free. That was never discussed. Damn near lost a sale because of that miscommunication. He was livid. I was informing him of better wording to use so we don\u2019t have it occur again. Does he listen? No. We\u2019ll fudge the numbers next time to appease the customer and head office won\u2019t find out. \n\nNot on my tickets we won\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to be your escape goat. Cue toddler tantrum from \u2018ole reliable Ash. \n\nI used the tactics Ash taught me to \u201cfudge numbers\u201d and ended up using them on his big ticket items. Forgive me reader for I\u2019m admitting to fraud. The same fraud Ash committed, the same fraud he wanted me to do for him\u2026this time I did it for my own benefit. I had the ability to alter his sales after the actual sale (remember I was manager when he was out?) so I did just that. Not \u201ctechnically\u201d theft but I get a few items for free from the store based on discounts to customers they didn\u2019t know they got. I know, I\u2019m terrible. I\u2019ll meet my maker and have to explain. Like I said\u2026I\u2019m playing dirty now.\n\nTowards the end of summer 2011, my relationship with my significant other came to an abrupt end, and I decided, I\u2019m done. I\u2019m not staying in this city with a job I hate, and an ex I don\u2019t want to see, I\u2019m done. Called up my parents that evening and told them the situation, they offered me to stay with them short term until I could get back on my feet.   \n \n\nCalled VP of the company after talking to my folks and said \u201cI\u2019m moving to Houston. Is there a job available for me there?\u201d   \n \u201cHave you told Ash about this?\u201d  \n \u201cNo, I\u2019m moving for personal reason. I\u2019m going right to the source that can help me.\u201d  \n \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do, we\u2019ll talk tomorrow.\u201d\n\nNext day I walk in and inform Ash that I\u2019m moving. I am giving him a generous 4 week notice so he can get someone in to replace me and I will train to the best of my abilities. He tried to talk me out of leaving (he knew he was screwed without me) but I insisted I had nothing left for me in this town and will be moving on. VP said all he could offer was a part time position at the Houston location, which I took (any job is better than no job).\n\n4 weeks come and go, no replacement. Find by me. Ash begged for me to stay, at least another month or two. Nope, I\u2019m moving in two days, everything is packed up and I\u2019ve been sleeping on an air mattress. I said farewell to my few coworkers who I know were going to miss me. And I left.\n\nNext week I entered the Houston store and within a few months went from part time to full time, to assistant manager, to acting manager. This place was awesome! The Houston manager, Drew (name change), was a godsend. His mentality was \u201cfamily first\u201d and \u201ctrain up or train out\u201d, which are two truths I hold true to this day. \n\nAsh on the other hand was exposed without me to save his ass. The college students didn\u2019t care about long term effects, they could quit and find a new job. He hired multiple full time people (one after another) to fill my spot, but none stayed much longer than a month or two. No one wanted to deal with his bull crap. The revolving door of employees brought a watchful eye from HQ and they noticed Ash\u2019s inability to process orders in a timely manner (like Amazon, online orders had to go out same day), his receipts were askew, and on top of their lack of tolerance of him as a person, he wouldn\u2019t last much longer. The VP started frequenting his store much more.\n\nI was having a lovely day in Houston and got a phone call from VP, \u201cTell me more about Ash.\u201d I unleashed all the petty things he had done that he was too ignorant to listen to earlier. It wasn\u2019t legally ethical issues, just moral and annoying things.\n\nThe next day I called the store to check up on an in stock item expecting to speak to Ash and unexpectedly VP answered. \u201cWhere\u2019s Ash?\u201d  \n \u201cHe\u2019s no longer employed here.\u201d  \n \u201cOh no, what happened?\u201d I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be terminated based on the dumb shit I said.  \n VP told me, \u201cI haven\u2019t been this happy in a long time, OP. After two years, I joyfully drove down here so I could terminate Ash. Thank you.\u201d\n\nFINALLY! The large sales weren\u2019t enough to save the simple minded gimboid. \n\nWithout any decent connections in this state, and his tail between his legs, he decided to move back to his home state to live with his mom. He didn\u2019t have a means to transport two vehicles or what few belongings he acquired in two years. His Viper truck was in the shop when he was fired and he spent the last bit of his money to get it out. He purchased it for nearly $70,000 (top of the line in the mid-2000s!) and ended up having to sell that monstrosity quickly and only ended up getting maybe half or 2/3rds of its then value (about 9 years old at that point). \n\nHe kept the little taco truck, packed his hat collection, and left most of his belongings in his old apartment. Along the 1,400 miles journey home, his taco truck broke down. I guess nearly 250,000 miles on an almost 20 year old micro truck was too much for his aging engine. Ash abandoned it and took just a few items and finally made it back home. Now, nearly penniless, living with mom, he tried to re-establish himself with his former employer. It\u2019s been 8 years and last I heard, he failed again and ended up moving to China to work in a clothing manufacturing company out there. I guess the \u201cit\u2019s easy to move around\u201d mentality was good for him and he finally found an industry where his \u201cskills\u201d are useful. \n\nGood riddance. Ash, if you\u2019re reading this. You\u2019re an asshole and you\u2019re probably one of the worst people I\u2019ve met.",

We added him on Snapchat and made a huge group chat with all of our other friends from the app, him included. It all went fine for a bit but me and another member were having a weird feeling about him since he always made shitty racist, homophobic, and sexist comments and seemed to be completely serious about it. I decided to start an inside job of my own since I thought no one else was aware that he was an asshole. I became so close to him to the point were he started calling me his little sister everywhere he went (I\u2019m 2 years younger than him). At some point I told Maddie about what I was doing and she decided she\u2019d help me out since she was also close to him. She started to have conversations with him way more often and at one point even had to pretend to hate Brent (Entitled asshole had always been weird about Brent) Maddie started to say Brent annoyed her and she hated how we all workshopped him. Brent was the one who owned the streaming channel and he had tons of fans who loved him, Maddie being one of the top fans. We kept this going for a good few weeks. He had no idea. Through the weeks we took screenshots of every bad thing he said about everyone else in the group and soon enough we had full on albums of his awful comments about others. He was even stupid enough to talk shit about me to Maddie knowing me and her are pretty close and she\u2019d tell me about it. He would call people whores and then go back to those same people and comment on others. He would say \u201cgay people aren\u2019t even supposed to exist\u201d he would act entitled and would always try to lead the chat on his terms. He at one point even suggested to Maddie that they should use Brent to get views and followers and then drop him. He also mentioned me and other members of the chat kissed Brent\u2019s ass way to much and we were obsessed with him (Id say that\u2019s called basic decency and friendship but ok) Now that we had the dirt it was time to drop it. Entitled asshole is pretty well known on the platform and among our group of friends so it was only a matter of getting everyone he knew in one place. Since we hit 8k followers we made announcements all over social media about a \u201chuge stream party\u201d and mentioned crazy stuff (call it clickbait) to get as many people into our stream. We started the huge stream per usual. At the beginning we only had the usuals who\u2019d come watch, about 30-40 people. But hitting the 2 hour mark we had well over 600+ people watching us do the stupidest shit. After we were done with a challenge we sat down and said it was time for a very big announcement. Now clearly we weren\u2019t just gonna drop it all in one go, we wanted it to HURT. So we started talking about how amazing everyone in our group chat was and slowly started mentioning different people and how they were such loyal friends and would show messages of support they had sent. When we came upon AE we all smiled to ourselves. Here\u2019s how that part went, \n\nBrent: Id also like to talk about AE. He has been such a supportive friend and I know he\u2019ll always have our backs. He\u2019s an amazing person and I\u2019m grateful to have him as a fan. \n\nMe: I appreciate him a lot. We\u2019ve gotten very close to the point where I see him as a big brother and we talk about a lot of things together. \n\nNow it was time to show the \u201csupportive messages\u201d and boy those were real supportive\u201d \n\nHe had said things like: \n\u201cI don\u2019t know why they think Brent is so awesome, tbh he\u2019s entitled and cocky. He\u2019s worthless\u201d \n \nAnd \u201cOP and (other members) kiss his ass so much it\u2019s disgusting. They\u2019re obsessed with such a piece of shit.\u201d\n\nWe slowly started putting the messages up on screen so everyone had time to read them. At that point when he realized what was going on he had already left the stream and was BOMBARDING me and other people he \u201ctrusted\u201d with tons and tons of messages including some threats that we obviously didn\u2019t take seriously. People in the stream (which he also talked shit about) were MAAAAAAD and they started unfollowing him and telling everyone they knew about the stream and what was going on. Soon enough we had well over 1,000 people looking at these screenshots of someone they knew stabbing them behind their backs. And we had screenshots for DAYS! At some point we came to the end of the huge album of messages and without even saying anything else we mentioned \u201cThe show\u2019s over Entitled asshole\u201d and ended the stream. We ignored his messages for that night and wouldn\u2019t respond to any of his phone calls. This asshole went from 5k followers to 900 in a couple of days and watching the numbers slowly go down was the sweetest part. \n\nWe kicked him off the chat and blocked him everywhere. A few weeks later we searched him up and his account was gone. I assume he left for good because his reputation in the app is completely ruined. Don\u2019t talk behind people\u2019s backs, there\u2019s always someone else listening.",

I had a deal with him. 200 USD. \nSo he came to my flat as agreed and took a look at the watch.\n\n\"Yeah... I can do like 150 for this\". \n\nWhat do you mean? We had an agreement, is it not up to your standards?\n\n\"Oh it's fine. But I brought 150, and thats fair.\"\n\nYou know I told a lot of other people the watch was gone since I decided to sell to you without taking bids?\n\n\"So... 150?\"\n\nNo thanks dude.\n\n\"Sure, np. You just call me when you're ready to sell.\"\n\nI went about my business for the rest of the day. The day after in the afternoon I decided to text him that I was ready to close.

            "selftext": "TLDR- teacher told me to get over it when classmates repeatedly copied off of me, so I fed them crap answers on an important project \n\nThis happened back when I was in 7th grade. I loved school, was the kid who asked for extra homework and just enjoyed books. I have autism and I could understand books but not people. For the most part of my schooling I had awesome teachers except for this one. I had him for history, which happened to be my favorite subject. My classmates started taking my papers when I was done and passing them around to copy off of. I couldn\u2019t stand up for myself due to autism social skills, so I talked to my teacher and he told me it was fine if they did that, and to just go with it. I was so upset, I went home and vented to my mom. I worked really hard on my work and didn\u2019t appreciate other people getting a\u2019s when they didn\u2019t even try. My mom came up with a plan. So the next day, we had extra time at the end of class to start on our homework. So I quickly wrote down totally wrong answers for every question. I usually worked in assignments during class when the teacher was talking because I had read ahead. When I had finished my class mates grabbed it and copied it. That night I erased it and answered it All correctly. A few days later when we all got our papers was hilarious, half the class had failed the assignment ( a assignment I might add that was actually pretty important grade wise) my teacher was pretty confused and upset that many students had failed. One kid grabbed my paper and saw that I had an A, and it clicked in his head what I had done. They got upset, and I just smiled as I read in the textbook.",

            "selftext": "(Originally I posted this to r/pettyrevenge, but I think it belongs here.) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast summer I was at a cousin's wedding. His bride and her family had been close with ours since before I was born, and the couple had known each other since they were toddlers, so it was a particularly exciting event for both sides of the family.\n\nHowever, after the ceremony was over and the party had only just started, one of the bridesmaids decided to announce her own engagement. The attention was immediately taken away from the newlyweds and brought to the bridesmaid (who I'll call Sarah) and her equally-smug fianc\u00e9. My cousin's wife (I'll call her Emma) didn't make a scene or utter a single negative word about Sarah. She looked like she was on the verge of tears, but she kept grinning and acted very happy for the other couple. This was unusual, as Emma is typically quite confrontational and speaks her mind no matter the consequences.\n\nSarah later picked Emma to be the maid of honor at her own wedding, which took place last weekend (I wasn't there for it, but my cousin sent me some of the best bits on snapchat and explained the whole situation).\n\nThis is where the fun begins.\n\nEmma's two much-younger sisters were the flower girls at Sarah's wedding. At the very last moment, Emma switched out the white petals in their baskets to blue ones she had secretly brought with her. She told her sisters not to say anything about it or let the bride see them until it was time to scatter them down the aisle.\n\nSarah looked very confused upon seeing the blue petals (which didn't coordinate whatsoever with her theme), but of course she didn't say anything about it in the moment. Most of Sarah's other bridesmaids were also Emma's friends, had attended Emma's wedding, and were in on Emma's scheme. At the reception, Emma's sisters and the other bridesmaids were tight-lipped when Sarah began demanding to know why there were blue petals. The wedding planner ended up getting a lot of abuse for not checking the flower girls' baskets before they walked down the aisle.\n\nFinally, it was time for the speeches. The speeches took place in front of a massive screen, displaying a loop of photos with Sarah and her husband, which had been compiled by Emma.\n\nEmma took the remote that controlled the presentation screen and at first she showed some pre-approved humorous photos of Sarah with Emma and other friends to facilitate a couple lighthearted jokes.\n\nThen, at the very end, Emma said to Sarah that she must be wondering why there were blue petals instead of the white ones originally planned.\n\nThat was when Emma displayed the last slide from her presentation.\n\nEmma announced in front of everyone that she was five months pregnant, and that she'd just discovered the baby was a boy, hence the blue petals. The last slide? Her ultrasound picture.\n\nThere were shocked yells and gasps, Sarah had a fit, but those involved in the scheme cheered so loudly that I sincerely regret watching the snapchat recordings with headphones. Apparently Sarah had been very nasty to her bridesmaids before, driving several of them away and forcing the others to pay ridiculous amounts of money for dresses.\n\nEmma and my cousin were eventually thrown out of the party, but they were all smiles. Sarah's fuming mother went to confront her outside, and Emma retorted with, \"Gentle, gentle! I'm pregnant!\"\n\nI reckon Sarah doesn't speak to the majority of those bridesmaids anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[Tl;dr\\] Self-important bridesmaid announces her engagement at my cousin's wedding, stealing the spotlight from him and his bride. Said bridesmaid foolishly names my cousin's wife her maid of honour and behaves like a complete bridezilla. Cousin's wife sabotages her wedding to announce her own pregnancy.",

            "selftext": "A little background: I used to work at an amusement park where 15 year olds working there had sever restrictions. Now I didn't know what I was and wasn't aloud to do. They never really made it clear and left it to my supervisor. \nMy supervisor, whom we'll call Stacy, was supposed to tell me what I can and can't do,\n except she didn't. So this led to me getting her fired and getting promoted at the same time. I'm also slightly autistic and can be conned easily\n\nThe story:\nA few years back I worked at an amusement park and made pretty good pay. When I was doing the interview, she told me that my supervisors would be able to help me every step of the way. During training I was told basic stuff like, I'm not aloud to clean or touch the ovens or anything that produces heat or is too cold. So I'm working the cashier one day and my supervisor comes up and tells me she needs help in the back. I finish with the last customers and close down my line, telling my coworker I'll be right back. I go in the back and she tells me I need to help her put away the order. Basically I have to restock. I tell her I'm not aloud to lift heavy stuff and that she'll have to get someone else to help her. She tells me she knows better than me and that I am aloud to help. So I get to work because I believe her and then the head manager comes in and asks me what I'm doing. I tell him \"Stacy said to put away the order\" he tells me I'm not aloud to, which is what I thought, but she told me I could. The head manager knows about me being autistic and he offers to speak to her. I tell him okay and he tells me to go back on cashier. I go home early and I'm not made to come back tomorrow even though I was already scheduled so I call my supervisor and she tells me that steve (head manager) told her to tell me that I'm not needed to come back to work (I got fired pretty much) so a few hours later I get a very angry phone call from Steve asking why the hell I'm not at work and that I need to get here right now. I calmly tell him that Stacy told me that you told her I'm fired. Silence. He hangs up the phone and I get a call from Stacy stating that she got fired and has no idea why. She's clearly upset and starts breaking down on the phone. I try to comfort her in the best way I can but I eventually found out after work that she messed with my schedule and didn't schedule my days. She also forged a two week notice two weeks ago and turned it in for me. I get extremely pissed off and start yelling at her. I don't usually get angry and am generally a calm person and caring. She starts yelling back at me and I figure now is a good time to record the conversation. I start recording and manage to catch everything. Her forging my two week notice. Her telling me I'm useless and she didn't want me at work in the first place. She called me an autistic retard and that I should hang myself. She gives me death threats etc. I show up to work the next day and let Steve listen to the recording. He tells me he'll be right back. He comes in a few minutes later with the police and shows them the recording. They tell us to give them our cell numbers and tell us they'll call us when they figure out what's going on. I found out later that she ended up getting arrested for forgery, multiple count of theft (she had been stealing from work for well over 3 years and had about $2000) her car was taken away for suspected fraud and she was given a bail of $120,000 and 15 years without parole. She also was tried for child neglect and animal abuse as it was later found out she had been selling her child's belongings to make a living. Her child was 4 and extremely malnourished. He was taken away by cps and it added another 6 years onto her sentence. Her bail also went up to $300,000. I ended up getting promoted to lead (manager but with less benefits) when I turned 16 and got a pay raise.",

            "selftext": "Many years ago I worked as a pizza delivery driver for a chain franchise. The boss there was a sociopathic dictator and loved to micro manage everything...like checking our gas gauges to make sure we didn\u2019t have to stop for gas on busy nights. It was a crime free area, with good tips, so I put up with her nonsense. That was, until she gave her boyfriend a job there as a driver. He was the general sweet talking loser who always had big plans ( read :schemes) and they always fell through due to some excuse. Now, when you are a driver, usually you get a mish-mosh of customers. Far away deliveries, close ones, good tippers and bad ones. Mine ( and others) started getting all the far away ones and more and more the bad tippers. The boyfriend, however, started making actual bank with short runs and top tippers. Being a reasonable person, I figured this was just a temporary situation, and this was just to get him back on his feet. A steppingstone to something else. Six months later, in the depths of winter with a ton of snow , I am driving almost every time to the very boundaries of our delivery area. When I asked the manager about the assignment and bundling of our deliveries, she replied with a dismissive \u201cHe\u2019s just a better driver.\u201d Actually, he was terrible. When we answered the phones, any complaint lodged was usually against him. Finally I got a large order for an amazing tipper and he whined to her in the stockroom about me getting it. So she switched it to him. I was livid! Most people say revenge is best served cold, and it is, with heaters. I snatched a tin of anchovies from the stock room and offered to help carry the 12 pies out to his car. I set the four down in the bags on his front seat. Quickly, I opened the tin of anchovies, put 2 in each defrosting heater vent on top of the dashboard and then hucked the tin in the dumpster as fast as I could. I walked in, told her I quit and left. He got to spend the rest of winter with the choice of being freezing cold, or warm, but with the stench of hot, rotting fish blowing through the entire car. The moral of the story is always be nice to your employees and coworkers.",

            "selftext": "So truth be told I don't really know where to put this story. I'm not sure this sub is the right place, so please let me know if there's a better place for it. I suck at reddit ;_;\n\n\nThis takes place in a secondary school, specifically an all-boys one, and while it's not technically my own story I did watch it unfold with great amusement. Now a little backstory is required to set the scene, and it involves the end of what the assistant head called a \"gambling ring\". In essence there's a bin in the corner of the big study room in one of the buildings, and we would bet money on whether you could throw rubbish into the bin from the other side of the room. It was fine for a while but eventually people were owing anywhere between 50p and \u00a350, and we ended up with impromptu student debt collectors that basically just harassed people until they paid. Bear in mind this is a boys school in England, so they weren't like threatened with guns or anything like that, but it was stupidly annoying stuff like having your locker constantly broken into and your stationary stolen. Once the principal got wind of this he obviously took action, and that was that. \n\n\nExcept, of course, it wasn't. \n\n\nMost people were squared off by this point, although a few weren't. One in particular was a kid we'll call Ali. Now Ali owed about \u00a330 to various kids, and once the whole thing was busted he refused to pay anyone. Wouldn't even talk about it. Bear in mind the school is super vigilant at this point, so there was no way to pester him for it. Obviously, he had a massive target on his head, and it was only a matter of time before someone hit it.\n\n\nIt took a while before the opportunity presented itself, but eventually it did. News filtered down that some of the sixth form chemistry students were learning how to extract Capsaicin oil - basically all you needed was this special type of ethanol that the school provided. For those that don't know, Capsaicin is basically the Devil's deodorant - it's what makes chillies hot. This is the stuff they use in pepper spray to inform you that it's not actually police brutality so stop screaming so loudly. And, for better or worse, this information filtered down to a student we'll call Mac.\n\n\nNow Mac was notorious for giving a grand total of zero fucks. One of his more well-known stunts was to burn himself with a soldering iron for \u00a320, to give you an idea of the sort of guy he was. And he also happened to be growing a batch of some of the hottest chillies he could get his hands on. I'd tried the tiniest bit of one, and it damn near blew my face off. These things weren't so much peppers as thinly-veiled death threats from Satan - I dont remember what breed or species they were, but they were hella hot. \n\n\nSo Mac hears about this chemistry experiment, and convinces someone to get him a tiny bottle of this ethanol. And then, of course, he turns up with what can only be described as a liquid biological weapon. You couldn't even breathe near it when he opened it up, it was that bad. I refused to try any but a few people did a drop of this stuff and immediately regretted it. I have no idea whether it was pure Capsaicin or whether he'd just mashed chillies up and sacrificed a few innocent souls over them, but the resulting bottle was hotter than a porn star in an oven. He then proceeded to sell it to another student we'll call Zak.\n\n\nNow I should mention that this part will not be as detailed, because at this point I was connecting the dots and could see where this was going. Zak was of course owed money by Ali, which meant I knew exactly where Lucifer's lube was going to end up. I also knew that knowing Mac it was unlikely to actually be Capsaicin, and more likely some horrid mixture of ethanol and chillies. Neither of these would be healthy or edible in any way. I could smell trouble, so I kept my distance. \n\n\nSure enough, Zak spikes some sweets with this hot sauce, and proceeds to give Ali one during lunch on the pretense of sharing them. It didn't take long before the heat hit, and oh it hit him hard. We're talking full on panic, like he'd stuffed a porcupine into his mouth and had a good few heart bites before realising. Everyone was laughing, right up until the point he puked on the floor. It was only a little bit but that changed the mood, and he ended up going to the nurse.\n\n\nInterestingly enough nobody actually got into trouble, since there wasn't any proof of anything and nobody snitched, so Ali had to just live with his torched tongue for the next few weeks. They did bring Mac in since he had a history of antics with chillies, but because he only had actual peppers on him (and fully intact ones at that, not broken up or anything) they ended up letting him go.\n\n\nIt took Ali about 6 days before he let his guard down and accepted food from someone else. Of course, it was a friend of someone else he owed. Of course, he probably realised that as he was puking on the floor again. \n\n\nThis time the school was pissed. I imagine his mother got involved as Mac was dragged in and blamed for the mess. They couldn't really prove anything but apparently still just stuck him in detention, just so they had someone to punish. I would be more annoyed at this if Mac actually cared about the detention, but I very much doubt he did. \n\n\nMore importantly, a few days later Ali suddenly didn't owe anybody money anymore. School was still banning any monetary transactions between students, but his debt had mysteriously been wiped and those he owed were surreptitiously richer. Funny how that works.",

            "selftext": "Hi, I'm new to this subbreddit and wanted to share this story. The parent is my father.\n\nContext: In the Philippines, there are a vehicles known as Tricycles which are motorcycles with side seat attached that allowed up to 4 people to sit in, 2 in front and 2 behind and that the front of the side seat had a windshield and a car cover (important for later), that are used as other means of transportation aside from buses or Jeeps. And another thing is that in the Philippines, there are a lot of Asshole drivers who would not give way to other people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is an image of a tricyle as an example: [https://www.dreamstime.com/editorial-stock-photo-tricycle-running-street-cebu-philippines-image74558653](https://www.dreamstime.com/editorial-stock-photo-tricycle-running-street-cebu-philippines-image74558653)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStory:\n\nMy family planned a trip from Manila to Tagaytay which is a province in the south side in the Philippines. We were going there for a family vacation and time to spend away from Work or School. I was around 10 when this occurred. We set out in our family car and it was about a 2 hour drive on a huge highway about a 5 lane highway. When we reached the province, it was more of a 2 lane roadway now. We arrived at the hotel and stayed for a while longer till we decided to go eat dinner. It was around 5pm and that the sun was nearing to set at that point. While driving in an open road btw, not many cars in sight, a tricycle driver made a quick u-turn in front of our car and nearly made us hit a house nearby (Do take note that this was the Tagaytay Highlands in which the road was between houses and that one side of road were houses on a mountain with a view of the lake. Which meant that any wrong move from car drivers either damaging homes or send themselves straight off the side of the mountain and hitting other houses below. Search if you don't know). After the tricycle driver made our car stop nearly hit another person's house. My dad got furious he slammed his hands on the wheel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe revenge:\n\nThe effect was immediate, my father started to follow the guy while my mother was trying to calm my father down. He did not listen and followed the guy to a place where other tricycle drivers stopped to rest and what not. He pulled up to the area, angrily took off his seatbelt and proceeded to open the door and violently slam it that it shook the whole car and made a large noise that startled the drivers in the area. He immediately identified the driver and the tricycle he drove. As I was in the car, I could hear him shout violently towards the driver in Tagalog(Philippines language) of course saying profanities and shouting what could have happened if he did not stop properly when the driver made the u-turn. I saw the guy try to make an excuse or apologize that my father did not accept. As my father was walking away from the driver, he turns to the front of the tricycle and proceeds to PUNCH the windshields with his BARE HANDS. Shouted to him one last time (Cant remember what he said), went inside the car, and drove us back to the hotel as his hands were bleeding a bit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know whatever happened to the guy as I moved countries, but there is one thing I hoped he learned, be better at driving or suffer the wrath of a very angry family person",

The parent is my father.\n\nContext: In the Philippines, there are a vehicles known as Tricycles which are motorcycles with side seat attached that allowed up to 4 people to sit in, 2 in front and 2 behind and that the front of the side seat had a windshield and a car cover (important for later), that are used as other means of transportation aside from buses or Jeeps. And another thing is that in the Philippines, there are a lot of Asshole drivers who would not give way to other people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is an image of a tricyle as an example: [https://www.dreamstime.com/editorial-stock-photo-tricycle-running-street-cebu-philippines-image74558653](https://www.dreamstime.com/editorial-stock-photo-tricycle-running-street-cebu-philippines-image74558653)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStory:\n\nMy family planned a trip from Manila to Tagaytay which is a province in the south side in the Philippines. We were going there for a family vacation and time to spend away from Work or School. I was around 10 when this occurred. We set out in our family car and it was about a 2 hour drive on a huge highway about a 5 lane highway. When we reached the province, it was more of a 2 lane roadway now. We arrived at the hotel and stayed for a while longer till we decided to go eat dinner. It was around 5pm and that the sun was nearing to set at that point. While driving in an open road btw, not many cars in sight, a tricycle driver made a quick u-turn in front of our car and nearly made us hit a house nearby (Do take note that this was the Tagaytay Highlands in which the road was between houses and that one side of road were houses on a mountain with a view of the lake. Which meant that any wrong move from car drivers either damaging homes or send themselves straight off the side of the mountain and hitting other houses below. Search if you don't know). After the tricycle driver made our car stop nearly hit another person's house. My dad got furious he slammed his hands on the wheel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe revenge:\n\nThe effect was immediate, my father started to follow the guy while my mother was trying to calm my father down. He did not listen and followed the guy to a place where other tricycle drivers stopped to rest and what not. He pulled up to the area, angrily took off his seatbelt and proceeded to open the door and violently slam it that it shook the whole car and made a large noise that startled the drivers in the area. He immediately identified the driver and the tricycle he drove. As I was in the car, I could hear him shout violently towards the driver in Tagalog(Philippines language) of course saying profanities and shouting what could have happened if he did not stop properly when the driver made the u-turn. I saw the guy try to make an excuse or apologize that my father did not accept. As my father was walking away from the driver, he turns to the front of the tricycle and proceeds to PUNCH the windshields with his BARE HANDS. Shouted to him one last time (Cant remember what he said), went inside the car, and drove us back to the hotel as his hands were bleeding a bit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know whatever happened to the guy as I moved countries, but there is one thing I hoped he learned, be better at driving or suffer the wrath of a very angry family person",

            "selftext": "The normal I\u2019m on mobile, english is not my first  language so sorry for my bad grammer. TLDR in the bottom\nThe cast\nEGF=ex gf\nEF=ex friend\nCB=cool boss\nMe= Me the OP\nFO=first officer\n\nOkay so this story takes place back in the late summer of 2016. So I\u2019m a pilot for a big airline, and at that time I was working alot more than I usually do to afford my EGF and I\u2019s dream house. But when I came home, she would never lets say....... (hug in bed). But she still took the pill. She would also often work late and when, she worked late I would often text EF if he wanted to hang out but he would always be busy or not respond. One day I had to use my laptop I never use to.. how do I put this lightly, bust a nut because we had not had sex in 6 weeks. So when I open the laptop I see It is logged into her facebook and it has a chat open between my EF and her thats odd I think so I begin reading. I Can clearly see alot of the messages has been deleted but I Can see they are chatting at that moment. I read what they are writing and find out she is gonna divorce me 1 month after we get married so she Can take half of everything. I also read that she is gonna tell me she is going to DC but really him and her are gonna go to the Bahamas. But here is the bombshells he got fired and is now a DRUG DEALER! And is gonna smugle drugs with him. And they are flying with my airline. So in the mist of all the rage and sadness I decide Im going to get revenge. She of course comes home kisses me and asks if she can go to the businesstrip to DC in my best nice pilot voice I say \u201cof course, have fun\u201d. The next day I get to the pilots lounge. And everyone can see something is wrong an I tell them what happend. The FO suggest we should ask CB if we could maybe switch flights with the Bahamas pilots and the Bahamas pilots want to help. So we ask CB and he is 100% onboard.\nSo we take of I get the FO to do the ATC. And when we get to crusing altitude I walk down the plane and EGF spots me and goes ghost White. I take my time and talk to the kids and stuff. When I get to Them the following convo happend.\n\nEGF: W...W.....WHY ARE YOU HERE ARE YOU STALKING ME OR SOMETHING?!!!.\n\nMe: No im just flying, the Bahamas route today. But aren\u2019t you going to DC. And EF why are you here with EGF?.\n\nEF: STOP BEING DISRESPECTFUL TO ME AND EGF OR YOUR GONNA REGRET IT!!!!\n\nMe: Is that a threat? \n\nEF: YEA IM GONNA F*CKING KILL YOU IF YOU DONT LEAVE US!!!!\n\nThe flightattendent hears this and tell the FO Who tells the nearest airport we are gonna land there due to a dangerous passenger. And to have police ready. We land and we tell all passengers to stay in their seats. And in comes amored police come in and take him off the plane. They search hus bags and guess what they find 1 pound of cokecain \nHe got life in prison for drugtrafficking (30years)\n\nAnd she got (15 years) for helping\nI got together with my hot flight attendent and yea we live in a huge nice house, have a cute dog and a baby on the way so yea everything got better",

            "selftext": " \n\nIt\u2019s long one.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt isn't revenge in the sense that some of the posts are, but it was a wild ride nonetheless.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis starts about 2001 ish.  It\u2019s hard to remember exact dates at this point. My ex-husbands family is the worst.  Seriously.  He comes from old money, it doesn\u2019t matter that most of them are barely scraping by.  The Family Name is their pride and joy.  I come from nowhere.   I have no family and have been on my own since I was 17.  They hate me.  When we met I was the regional manager for a company and making enough money to support myself and put a little into savings each week.  I was only 26 and life had bounced me pretty hard a few times...that\u2019s another story for another day.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe had been dating about a year when he got sick.  He spent 4 months in the hospital and almost died multiple times.  When he was released, his sister refused to let him come back to her house because he he couldn\u2019t work.  He had been living with them and paying the utilities, buying the groceries, paying the lease on a car for his sister to drive  and the private school tuition for both of his nephews for about 2 years.  In return he had a small bedroom without a closet in a 5 bedroom house. They literally bought a trashcan and put all is clothes in it and put it out on the curb where it was dumped and everything of value was stolen.  It had also been out there for weeks so everything was ruined.  He came home with me, he had nowhere else to go.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI bought him new clothes and a game system so he would have something to do while he recovered.  He owned a small trucking company, 5 trucks, that he had built up from nothing.  To keep his drivers in work he contracted them out to other companies and took a huge hit on his money.  Eventually a larger company made an offer to buy his company and contracts and he took it.  After it was all said and done (fuel payments, truck notes etc)  there was about $12,000 left over.  This was going to be delivered to his sisters house via check and courier service as soon as the accountants finished picking the bones.  We are living about 70 miles from his sister in another state and are only in the area when we take him for chemo.  At the time I had no idea what she was capable of.   (He doesn\u2019t have cancer he has an autoimmune disorder but certain chemos have some success in treating what he has.   ITP if anyone wants to look it up )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWeek after week, no check.  Every week she lies.  Week six later puts me working close to their house.  (traveling position, different city every week)  He went over to spend the day with his nephews and I was going to meet him after I got off work.  She tells hims that someone from the accounting firm came to the house and demanded that she pay them $500 in accounting fees before they will release the check, which she says she paid.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow let me interject something here, she is Bat Shit Crazy.  I have multiple degrees and certifications that allow me to say that now.  Bat. Shit. Crazy.  She has no concept of reality whatsoever.  She is delusional, narcissistic and just plain mean. \n\n \n\nMy husband believes her.   He had my debit card (I was at work) and he pulled the money out of my savings account to pay her.  I should have kicked him out of my life right here, but I didn\u2019t.   It was after business hours when I found out.    I fumed the whole weekend.   His sister cried and moaned the whole time we were at their house about how I awful I was and how I was just trying to steal his inheritance.  There isn\u2019t an inheritance, their father died in 1969.  But that\u2019s another story.   I finally left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday morning I made him call the accountants.  The check ended up being for more than what he thought, about $15,000...and it had been delivered and signed for by Bat Shit Crazy Sister.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInsert Mega Drama Here!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe convinces everyone in his family that I left work, drove 70 miles and waited in the bushes for the courier and signed her name.  And they believed her.  So my ex in now in the position that is he pursues the missing check, either his sister or his fiancee is going to jail for a long, long time.  So he does nothing.  He\u2019s out $15,000  I\u2019m still out $500.  He never stood up for me.  He swore up and down he believed me, but he never backed me up.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd yes, the money was in her account.  Her husband told me years later that he knew, but that without  my ex living there they needed the money to keep up with the tuition and lease payments.  They felt it was justified because he left without giving them any kind of notice.  Great people.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn 12 years of marriage, he never had my back.  Bat Shit Crazy Sister made it her mission in life to make me miserable.  \n\nSome of the rumors she started about me over the 12 years we were married.  \n\nThat I have AIDS\n\nThat I was a prostitute while I was living in New York.  I\u2019ve never lived in New York.  \n\nThat I tried to kill her with tree nuts.  She\u2019s allergic.  \n\nThat I stole my truck.  \n\nThat I had warrants for my arrest ranging from assault, drug possession with intent to distribute, prostitution, fraud, embezzlement, and my personal favorite, stealing her garden gnomes.  I know for a fact it was her son who took them.\n\nI gave her cancer.  \n\nI am poisoning her with a voodoo doll.  \n\nThat I am a satanist\n\nThat I was excommunicated from the catholic church for trying to seduce a priest\n\nThat I am a registered sex offender.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe only one she actually got right was telling people I was bisexual, which I am but I sure as hell never told her!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started squirreling money away that my Ex didn\u2019t know about.  The company I was working for had a stock program.  They would match whatever I contributed up to $75 per pay check, but I could take out much more and I did.  I only worked there about 5 years but I built up a nice  little nest egg.  This was about 2004.  The reason I got fired is Bat Shit Crazy Sister called in complaint after complaint about me.  My manager knew they weren\u2019t true, but she was making such a nuisance of herself that they fired me to get rid of her.  I took a property management job that included a small house as part of the deal and went back to school.  Boy did The Family hate that.  I needed to be home taking care of him because he was sick, not spending his money on an education.  He was getting about $1,100 a month in disability payments and most of that went to medical. I was making even less, but we were doing OK.  Both vehicles were paid for  and we had minimal credit card debt.  That\u2019s when his sister strikes again.  She has always nickle and dimed us for money and after we moved to her city it got worse.   Ever week one of the boys needed something for school, they needed groceries, the utilities were about to be cut off.  It was every week.  My ex would just give her the money and leave me to sort our finances later. Then the big one. She had to have $1500 or the mob was going to kill her.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDid I mention Bat Shit Crazy?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell it turns out it wasn\u2019t too far from the truth.  She has a zanax problem that morphed into a meth problem, as in she\u2019s addicted and she owed her dealer a LOT of money.  They were in danger, I don\u2019t doubt that.  I saw the broken windows and the spray painted cars and I had a creepy guy come into my office because she sent him there, saying that I had the money she owed him.  I told her to give me a couple days to think about it and I started making phone calls.  I agreed to pay it on one condition.  I wanted collateral.  They owned 3 undeveloped lots in Florida and I wanted one, lock stock and barrel and they could buy it back from me in one lump sum at any time for 5 years.  I even had my lawyer draw up the agreement.   I got the deed, she got her money, which she immediately spent on more drugs from another dealer.  Her husband ended up taking a title loan on his truck, and lost the truck.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFive years comes and goes plus some.  By this time her lies and manipulations have worn away my marriage and I was done.  He\u2019s blind now, a side effect from one of the treatments, so I couldn\u2019t just pack and leave without making some arrangements for him.  His mind is just fine, but he can\u2019t live alone because of the meds he is on and the risk of him accidentally injuring himself.   I was almost done with my masters degree and all that was left was state certification.  There would be a divorce before I started working in my career because I was not giving his money grubbing family any more money than I already had.   I had 9 months then I was free to leave with a clear conscious. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne day I get a letter in the mail from the Florida deed office.  My ex has applied for a duplicate deed, but the  address on the deed  doesn\u2019t match the one where they want the duplicate sent, hence the letter.  If we didn't return the letter to them signed and notarized that we had requested the duplicate then we would be required to appear at the office in person to make any future changes.  Old system, but effective.   I asked him about it and once again it come out that it was Bat Shit Crazy trying to manipulate things.  He knew what she was planning.  They were going to get the new deed and then give me the $1500 after they sold it.  I told him in no uncertain terms that the deed was being transferred to my name or I was turning them both in to the police for whatever I could come up with.    We made a trip to Florida and transferred  deed to  my name.   We weren\u2019t home 2 days and she was at the house wanting to buy back that property.    They even offered more money for it and some bogus story about how their father bought that land  for the inheritance trust. Nope, it\u2019s mine now.  She ranted and raved and threw a hissy of all hissy fits. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cMy daddy bought me that land!  You are stealing my legacy!  OH!  You are going to make me have a bi-polar fit!\u201d  then she starts making faces and growling.  \u201cSEE!  This is your fault!  OH!  I\u2019m going to die and it\u2019s your fault!  MY LEGACY!  OH my poor daddy he would whip your ass if he was here!\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI called the security guard and had her removed from my office.  My Ex looks at me and says that maybe we should sell it to her.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cThere is no WE in this.  That property is mine and I\u2019m not selling it to you or her for ANY price!\u201d  I had saved that money by selling things on EBAY I found in yard sales and thrift shops  a few dollars at a time.  We had joint accounts for bills, but there wasn\u2019t nearly enough to cover a $1500 loan.  It all came out of my account.   The money I was saving was to get another truck when mine finally died and to finance my twice a year camping trips.   It was my money, not ours.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater that night, she took my Ex\u2019s truck.  It was still at their house because her husband was borrowing it to buy yard stuff and just hadn\u2019t brought it back yet.  She drove it to a casino about 50 miles away where she drunkenly drove through the parking lot in a ski mask, hitting as many cars as she possibly could.  It wasn't a rampage, it was clever and calculated.   The truck is totaled which is a shame because it was a really nice truck.  Then she checked in...and I kid you not...beat herself up. She had a black eye and, a split lip.  There was blood everywhere in that room, much more than what her split lip would account for.  He had bought theatrical blood at a costume shop.   It looked like a scene out of Dexter.  She is screaming bloody murder and crying and telling everyone who will listen that I kidnapped her and that I beat her up and that I am holding her dear, mentally disabled and incompetent brother hostage in our house.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was really surprised when the police showed up and arrested me for attempted murder and kidnapping.  I actually had a nice little lawsuit out of that one.  More about that later. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n They took my ex to the hospital.  He was slurring his words, he has a script for some pretty heavy narcotics for pain and this was a really bad night from a fall earlier in the day.    I wasn\u2019t on any security camera at the casino and our security cameras showed that my truck never left the locked and gated security area of the managers office.   There were only two doors and both had cameras.  One clearly shows me walking in and I don\u2019t leave again until I am hauled out in my nightgown at 3:30am.  Remember that Old Money Name?  Yeah, they were more concerned with that than the truth.  I was in jail for 6 days, never saw a judge because my case kept getting bumped off the docket, so no bail.  This was Memorial Day weekend to so the courts were closed most of the time.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe also found out that she was using his name and social security number  to get utilities, cell phones, they bought a car IN HIS NAME that we didn\u2019t know about.  There was a checking account that was several thousand dollars overdrawn and about 10 credit cards all maxed out and not a payment in site.  The majority of this occurred in less than 2 months.   My hard work, my good credit gave my Ex good credit and she stole it.  \n\n \n\nThe whole time I\u2019m in jail, I never hear a word from my ex.  He never answered when I called and he didn\u2019t come to visitation.  He told me later his sister needed him more than I did.  She was briefly hospitalized and she milked it for all it was worth.  The first thing my ex did was try to convince me not to press charges because she is sick.   It was actually out of my hands, but other than probation and a court ordered psych evaluation she got away with it.  There was about $8,000 worth of damage to the room which they were court ordered to pay restitution for, but they never paid my ex for the truck she totaled.  There is a difference between mental illness and evil and she has crossed that line.\n\n \n\nI was done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I got home from jail was out of that house in less than an hour and had filed for divorce in less than 24 hours.  I called his insurance rep and told them they had better get a home health nurse out there quick because he was alone and since I quit my job, he was going to need a place to stay in about 30 days. I took my cat, my great-grandmothers china and went to an extended stay hotel. Over the next 2 weeks  I cashed out my stocks and there was enough to pay a years rent on a small house and buy the furnishings I needed. If  I was careful there enough to see me through graduation.  I didn\u2019t want that money or the stocks to be considered and asset in the divorce especially since most of the investment occurred before we even met. The remaining money was used to buy pre-paid debit cards and to trade in my truck on a better one.  I would have liked to have kept the stocks, but it was a sacrifice I was willing to make to get out on my own and letting him get his hands on the was not an option.  I finished grad school with a 3.82 GPA and 5 solid job offers. \n\n  \n\nHere\u2019s the revenge.  Remember that deed that cost me $1,500?    The day I signed the divorce papers (about 6 months later) I made a call.   There was a particular corporation buying up lots in central Florida.  They had been doing it quietly for several years.   They had all but three and my little deed was one of them.   I had suspected something was going on when the clerk at the deed office let it slip that she couldn\u2019t figure out why all these empty lots were selling all of a sudden.   Bat Shit Crazy and her husband had sold their remaining two lots for a total of $10,000 which is why they were trying to get that deed back.  The buyer had promised them more money if they could get their hands on the third.  In the meantime, one of the gossipy internet rags let it slip that Florida was getting some amazing new attractions.  The holdouts now had a huge piece of leverage.  I can\u2019t say who the buyer was per the group rules, but you can probably figure it out.    My check for that one tiny little piece of land was a little over $125k. \n\n \n\nI sent a picture of that check via courier to her house.  Her reaction was to total their only working vehicle trying to back out of the garage with the door still closed.  Repeatedly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout 6 months later I sent a copy of the settlement check from the city to her house, which was REALLY nice.  Her false accusations and their wrongful arrest  cost me my job, I missed my mid-terms and had to repeat 2 classes which caused me to not graduate on time.  I was never officially charged with anything and there was never a warrant for my arrest.  I was never questioned, I never saw a judge and I was denied medical care for a severe asthma attack and left the jail with 2 untreated brown recluse spider bites.   I was also not fed for 36 hours and had my head smashed into a wall by a guard because I sneezed and he thought I was making fun of him.   They just wanted me to go away so they wrote me a fat check which I was more than willing cash.   It was 6 days of hell, anger, fear, confusion...but mostly fear.  I still have nightmares about it.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer reaction to my hard earned money was to smash every window in her house and get hauled off by the police with the choice of going to jail or going to a mental hospital. She chose jail.  In court she made such a scene she was found in contempt and hauled off for a psych eval and 72 involuntary hold.  Sometimes I love this state.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m done sending her things.  She is too erratic and violent and I don\u2019t want someone to get hurt.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n It\u2019s been almost 5 years and I\u2019ve had police at my door at least a dozen times questioning me.  I don\u2019t blame them they have to follow up on harassment claims.  She has even gone so far as to buy a burner phone and make harassing calls to herself and claim it was me.   Twice. She is never prosecuted and I am lectured on how I should be more compassionate for the mentally ill.  She did manage to get a restraining order against me which could impact my job.  My boss knows what she\u2019s like, but state licensing could be sticky.  I am planning on moving to the mountains as far away from this mess as I can get and  legally change my name.  Ironically I am close to my nephews, one is actually living with me while he attends the university. He is considering transferring out there when I move and his brother has already said he wants to go too.  I paid his college tuition and yelled at him until he figured out his life.  They are good young men and I am very proud that they overcame being raised by Bat Shit Crazy.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn January of this year her husband decided that he was also done and moved out in the middle of the night.  Her mental status rapidly declined to the point the courts decided she was unable to care for herself.  She is in a long term care facility.  It's not a nursing home, but it is permanent and they are well versed in her mental issues.   My ex is about 3 door down from her.  He was also declared unable to care for himself.  I actually feel bad for him.  His physical health has been pretty unbearable for 20 years, but the way he treated me means I have nothing left to give.  Nether have any relatives nearby, so guess who the courts asked to take guardianship? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI respectfully declined.",

            "selftext": " \n\nYou'd all be surprised at how apathetic Indian teachers are to bullying. I don't know the case now, but this is 2006 and the year when i finally stood up for myself.\n\nI fractured two of my lumbar vertebrae in an accident when i was 11 and it continues to plague me still and was the reason i became obese due to a restriction on exercise for a period of 5 years minimum (not very important later).\n\nThere is not much to name, but if i am referring to someone by an insult, that someone is Mr. bully himself\n\nThis testicular discharge always used to bother me and hit me, punch me and at one point, dumped an entire bottle of water and someone's lunch into my backpack, destroying my books and notebooks(this is India, we don't have lockers).\n\nThe girl whose lunch was dumped into my bag complained, and the teacher punished me by humiliating me in front of the class, fatshaming me and making me kneel and apologize to the girl whose food was dumped in my bag, in front of the entire class. The girl who complained, looked extremely sorry and remorseful. More incidents happened, including being kicked square in the back and being confined to bed for the week after(the fracture happened a year and ahalf ago at that point) .\n\nMy parents even mulled pulling me out of that school and filing a case against them. Insulting parents was a regular thing and the Bengali equivalent of the words 'bitch', 'slut', 'cunt', 'motherfucker' was used in abundance against them. I love my parents and retorted, which only led to increased bullying.\n\nSo one day, after having had enough and at this point, after two parent principal meetings where the principal just said that i am a weak loser who deserves to be bullied if i don't fight back, i don't know what came over me but i blacked out. The next thing i know, the bully is across the room wiping blood off his nose and my classmates shocked. I get to know i actually picked this 75 kilo sack of expired manure and threw him across the entire length of the classroom, no less than 20 feet atleast.\n\nNow the principal says they don't condone fighting and will suspend me for a month and bar me from giving exams, completely ignoring the sheer monumental levels of bullying that led to this moment. My parents threatened to go the police with all evidence of my fracture, written hospital notes of how the actions of the bullies could have paralyzed me forever, and the bruises that my doctor had treated me for. My father openly said that he will see to that the principal is rotting in jail and the school's existence vanished. My father was powerful and had connections, so you better believe he could do that. Now that i think back of it, I can see why the principal defended this kid so hard. He was a Christian, the school is a Christian school and the principal was a church affiliated person. Preferences being given to Christian kids in this school is no secret. \n\nThe parents were called only when this throwing incident happened and they, in typical fashion, denied their son's misdeeds. They tried to put the blame on me, saying their birth defect had complained about me,an introverted and socially inept individual, bullying him (and surprisingly they never thought about approaching the school for that. Either bad parenting or lies, take your pick).\n\nSo after this long argument session and the matter , the desecrated testicle is suspended for a while and then classes changed, and my classmates started behaving better with me. (they never liked me cause i was fat and was socially awkward and introverted and had non conventional hobbies like watching world cinema. 13 year olds don't understand that much empathy. But i guess it did end well because by the time we graduated, these people were some of my closest friends. I just still find it funny that these people now post about being awkward and socially handicapped, the things i was disliked for. Oh and did i mention that i am now regularly asked for my opinion on films and recommendations for cinema? i do help them, but i feel a parallel sense of anger and pride, the former for being hated throughout my younger life because of this, and pride, because now they have to consult me like i am some kind of film god)\n\nI eventually did befriend most of them later on, and our teacher was changed for obvious reasons. I did get better teachers, but the general apathy, the sexual abuse, the bullying and the way the school treated me has left a permanent mark in my head against that hellhole.\n\nThe principal did end up in jail, for skimming off the school fund. The joy of seeing that was indescribable, to see the person who berated me for not fighting. I hope you never get to work another day in your life and i hope the day you die, you get to remember the so many children whose school life was painful only because a pathetic bully like yourself was in the principal seat. \n\nI had not shared a very cordial relationship with my father, but i will forever be grateful for the steps he took and the lengths he went for me. He passed away in 2009, but continues to help us financially, courtesy of his great investments.\n\nMy mother is still going, but age is taking a toll combined with the recent suicide attempt of her daughter and the drastic career change decision of mine.\n\nAnd if you want me to prove that this real, i cannot. But i can give you some facts. This took place in Kolkata, India. My school is one of the 3 prominent private schools in the Dum Dum Nagerbazar area. If anyone wants to google map it, be my guest. I won't directly reveal the name of the school, but it has a gas station beside it. This is as much proof i can give of my school actually existing. \n\nIf any of you from my school are reading this, you are free to verbally berate me. You had a good school life while i was being abused daily by everyone. If you do want to confront me or demand any details of said incidents, please contact me on facebook.\n\nAnd as for you, you discarded banana peel, i hope you overdose on your own ugliness. I wish someday you experience the same pain you put me and my parents through. And i wish nothing but the worst on you.\n\nDdey, class of 2013, signing out.",

            "selftext": "I've been lurking awhile, and it finally came into my brain that this was something that would fit here. Sorry if grammar, spelling, etc is bad, English is my first language.\n\nSome backstory (sorry it's long):\nIt was about a year and a half ago, which would make me 15 years old or so. I had been playing an online game for about 4-5 years at that point, and I had a pretty close friend group. One girl, in particular (I'm male btw), was like my best friend. It's stupid but I actually developed a crush on her and we started \"dating\". I get added to a group chat (on discord), which has most/all of her real life friends. They were pretty chill and accepted me into their little party. Now, she had specifically asked me not to tell any of her friends yet, as she would probably get made fun of. I, being stupid and not knowing a red flag when I see one, said ok and kept it a secret. Everything was going great, until about the 2nd month, which was when Ex starting getting online and texting me less and less. She says that shes just busy and has a bunch of plans with her real life friends, and me, not wanting to be super clingy, didn't challenge this. Around the 3rd month we were together, it got to the point where she rarely texted me and we hardly ever played the game together. When questioned about it and asked if I was doing something wrong, Ex adamantly stated that I wasn't doing anything wrong and she was just busy a lot. The 3rd month was also around the time her friends had added a new guy to the group chat. Let's call him Joe. They knew him irl, but he was kinda weird and \"suicidal\" (wanted attention), so I didn't really feel threatened by him. I was getting more and more bitter about the relationship, because I felt like she was hiding something. Ex had started getting mad at the jokes I told when she would usually laugh at them. One day Joe, in the group chat, asked when he and Ex were gonna go on their next date. I, shocked and confused, ask how long they've been together. One of Ex's other friends, we'll call her Amy, said that they had been dating for about a month. Apparently Ex had asked that it be kept secret from me, as i have \"an obvious crush on her and she doesn't want my feelings to be hurt\". When I asked Ex, she just said that she was fake dating him so he wouldn't commit suicide. A. Still cheating. B. Pretty sure she was lying. My self esteem, at that point, was suuuper low. I was also depressed, not just about the relationship and the cheating, but also because I already had abandonment issues, and this was the icing on the cake.  Along with being depressed, I was also super pissed. This is the girl that I had fallen for, and she claimed the same. For weeks, she had claimed to be \"busy\", but I guess she just got bored of me or something. So I decided to get some revenge to make me feel better.\n\nThe cast at this point:\n-Me: hmmm\n-Ex: hMmm\n-Joe: Ex's irl boyfriend\n-Amy: Ex's irl best friend in groupchat\n\nThe revenge (finally):\nFirst thing I decided to do, was to break up on Valentine's Day (it was January something). There was a bit of time before Valentine's, though, so I collected info. The few times she talked to me, and still did, she liked to rant about her friends. Amy in particular. I went through weeks old chatlogs and screenshotted nearly every insult/complaint about her friends. I also went and got evidence that we were actually dating, since I wasnt sure they would believe me when I would tell them. Valentine's Day approached, and I started phase one. I texted her and asked if she wanted to play online game, and she said she was busy. I asked if she wanted to just text, and she said she was still busy. Expected answers. I DM'd Ex's friends and started convos about how Ex was always busy and had almost no time to hang out. Slowly, ever so slowly, I made them feel at least a little resentment towards her. I eventually brought up that in past convos she had actually insulted them. They were curious, but I said I needed a bit of time to get screenshots. It was about 10 PM, and Ex finally starts to text me. As planned. I start reminiscing about the good ol' days when she wasn't \"busy\". Hopefully getting her at least a little emotional. Bringing up all the good times we had together. I then broke up with her. Even though I had all this built up resentment, it was still difficult. Almost the second I did, I sent all the screenshots I had gathered in the group chat, including the ones that proved we had dated. Her friends were livid. Joe kept trying to question her about the relationship screenshots, while her friends were yelling at her about how could she they were friends or something like that. Ex starts asking me for an explanation in DMs, but I texted her: \"Sorry, I won't be able to reply for awhile. I'm busy.\" I didnt get a text back from her. I went to sleep, because I was pretty tired and only wanted to see the aftermath of the battle. When i woke up, I got a text from Amy that told me she and her other friends had cut ties with Ex. They apparently fought for over an hour, and at that point their friendship was already lost. Amy also said that Joe just stopped texting in the group chat, and the only thing he said to her was \"nope\". Apparently they broke up too. Amy then said they were still angry, so they would spread word around their school that Ex was a wh*re. I texted Ex that I wasnt just anymore.\n\nEx: \"what the f*ck?!\"\n\nMe: proceeds to call her a slew swear words\n\nEx: \"I thought you loved me how could you do this to me?!\"\n\nMe: explains to her how pissed i was and how i intentionally ruined her social life and then blocked her\n\nI eventually blocked all her friends because they kept texting me and I was pretty much done with them. I was still depressed and I didn't really want to be reminded of her more than I needed to.\n\n\nSorry it was so long. I'm not sure if I did this right, but whatever. Hope you had a fun time reading about how I dont like b*tches.",

The wife cheated on him so I started to get proof. She also owned her own business it was a bar btw. So I then told the husband she was cheating on him and he divorced her and he got alot of the stuff. This really hurt her business but I posted on Facebook on what happend to my dog. People were pissed and it got around town fast. There were only 2 maybe 3 family members that still liked her. Her business was destroyed and the whole town hated her and she had to move out of town.\n\nIf any youtubers are posting this link me the video I listen to a lot of youtubers ( hi rSlash )",

Well folks that\u2019s not how you should communicate with your spouse. \n\nSo after I tell her she has to end it now and work on our marriage she turns super cold. Asks me to stay at my parents for a night so she can have some time and space. Sure why not, well she decided that it was best to stay at her bosses place that night also. \n\nSo cue in big fight. We separate and she continues to see the boss. \n\nWell after 2 months of virtually no communication with her I get a drunk text. Asking to come over and see me. I was also drunk and thought why not. Well she stays the night and asks me to promise not to tell anyone. \n\nCue in a couple of days later. I text her boss that \u201cwe are even ;), and she stayed at my place that night\u201d obviously lying to boss where she was that night. \n\nWell he responds with a nice little text that reads.\n\u201c you are illegally retarded\u201d and just \u201cretarded\u201d \n\nYou see he is a manager at a restaurant/bar chain in Calgary and the surrounding around. So I screen shot the text and make a massive social media posts in Twitter, Instagram, and hit all the major review sites like yelp, google reviews, Facebook review and trip advisor. \nTagging the restaurant, the local restaurant, the local news, and the autism society. I said hey this is never ok and this manager shouldn\u2019t be speaking like this to anyone. \n\nSo now I play the waiting game for the company to get a hold of me and just looking to get him fired and I\u2019ll take down all the reviews and posts. \n\nRevenge in the making...",

            "selftext": "This is my first Reddit post so apologies beforehand if it\u2019s poorly written.\nDoubting  if i should post it but fuck it.\n\nEvents took place about 4 years ago.\n\nNote : I\u2019m from Southeast Europe and the public is extremely homophobic here , not the classic \u201c we hate gays \u201c homophobia , more along the likes of \u201c if you are anything besides straight you are labeled as insane/bashed/frowned upon etc\u201c.\nHad to point this out so the story makes sense.\n\nShortly before high school began I met a guy ( I\u2019ll call him Alex during this post ). \nWe attended different schools but we went out every single day after school, legit every single day. \nWe were basically best friends,he came over to my house i went over to his house and all that jazz. 1st year of high school passed fairly quickly. \n\nWhen summer break came around we decided to go on a vacation together.(Summer break here lasts 3 months, so we basically lived together for 3 months.)\n\nDuring our vacation he told me he was gay , which i didn\u2019t see coming, but I literally couldn\u2019t care less. I pretty much had no reaction and it was visible that he felt at ease.\n\nWhen year 2 of high school started I transferred to his school. I didn\u2019t like my old school plus i was gonna be with my best friend, so it was a win-win situation.\nI didn\u2019t tell him i was transferring, wanted it to be a surprise.\n\nThe moment I entered the classroom he got so startled, and he had this look on his face like all his ships have sunk.\nI didn\u2019t ay much attention to it but obviously i should have.\n\nI befriended his friends fairly quickly, but i mostly talked to one specific girl (Anna ).\nWe were messaging on and off and she was a relatively fun person . Alex talked a lot of shit about Anna and pretty much all of his school friends.\nHe would always be jumpy and anxious whenever I interacted with one of his school friends , he basically tried to alienate me from everyone.\n\nOne night i went out with Anna and we were chit chatting , nothing serious. \nOut of nowhere she asked me how my relationship with Alex was going. Didn\u2019t think much of it so i said uh fine why would you ask that? \nHer reply was : \u201c Don\u2019t worry I know ,I won\u2019t tell anyone , just curious\u201c\nStill no idea what she was on about.\n\nWe spent the entire night scrolling trough her endless conversations with Alex.\nIn short he had told her that me and him were dating since the moment we started hanging out.\n\nHe had sent her messages  along the lines of \u201c omw to my bfs house I\u2019m so horny \u201c every time he came over  , and sent her my nudes with a caption like \u201c he just sent me this he\u2019s so hot fuck\u201d\n( To this day i have no idea how he got my nudes , only logical explanation would be going trough my phone while i went to the bathroom or while i was asleep I genuinely don\u2019t know )\nThere were also a few pictures of me sleeping with a raging boner, I don\u2019t even wanna think about it.\n\nI explained the situation and she was just as shocked as I was. \n\nI wanted to confront him right away but I didn\u2019t. I messaged a dozen of his friends and he pretty much told the same story to everyone. \u201cThat we are in a relationship, I\u2019m his bottom bitch but no one can know because I\u2019m super duper closeted.\u201d\nAlso about 20+ people had my nudes.\n\nI pilled up screenshots and was ready to confront him. \nHe denied it at first but when i pulled out the screenshots from 15 different people he started crying and left.\n\nHe didn\u2019t show up to school the next day. \nI was expecting an apology at-least or an explanation  but all i got was a call from his father asking me why i beat him up. Apparently he had told his parents that i beat him up the previous night. \nI messaged his sister since Alex had blocked me and as I response i got :\u201d Don\u2019t try to contact me   anywhere or I\u2019m gonna tell everyone at school that you are gay and hitting on me i have your nudes, you are a stranger to them, guess who they are gonna believe\u201d \n\nI got beyond triggered , scrolled trough 2 years worth of chats and took screenshots of him talking shit about every single person in our class. \n\nNext day at school I told everyone he was gay , told the entire story about what happened, showed screenshots of him talking shit about pretty much everyone in class. \nNews spread like wildfire and soon enough pretty much the entire school knew not just our class. \n\nHigh school became actual hell for him.\nAll his friends turned on him.\nHe got extremely bullied. \nHe couldn\u2019t transfer schools because he kept skipping school and his grades dropped to 0.\nHe didn\u2019t show up to prom.\nA year has passed since we finished high school and he can\u2019t attend any college due to his grades being non existent.\n\nSide note: I went out with the 2-3 guys i know he liked just out of spite and posted pics on social media to  trigger him",

            "selftext": "3rd grade bully, let\u2019s call her Molly.\n\nShe would make very loud remarks about my accent. I came from the province, different dialect. She would also claim that I came from a poor family and we live in the slum. Not to brag, I came from a middle-class family and we lived in a nice apartment. But of course because I was a transferee, I was still a bit shy and would just let her tease me the whole day.\n\nBut things have gone worse and she didn\u2019t stop. The last straw was when she brought a ketchup bottle, and drizzled my chair with ketchup. Good thing I noticed it before I sat down. And while cleaning my chair with tissues, she was standing at the side while holding the ketchup bottle and laughed.\n\nEnough was really enough. I created a plan to take her down. So the plan is, I bought a very nice bright pink purse.  Then while we were having our PE at the gym, I sneaked out to our locker room and I put the pink purse on Molly\u2019s bag. I made sure the purse had some money in it, and my picture.\n\nThen later that day, I went to Ms. Santos (our adviser) and tell her about the \u201cmissing\u201d purse. So everyone gathered around with their bags and searched each bag for the \u201cmissing\u201d purse. And voila, Molly was shocked to see the purse. She couldn\u2019t speak for herself, couldn\u2019t explain why the purse was in her bag.\n\nMolly: I didn\u2019t steal this purse. Believe me, teacher.\nMs. Santos: But what is (my name)\u2019s purse doing in your bag?\nMolly: I don\u2019t know, Ms. Santos.\nMe: (my acting sad face) Why did you steal it, Molly? You already bully me everyday, why steal my purse?\n\nMolly was shocked. And I think she finally realized it was me who did it. Not only she was sent to the principal\u2019s office, her friends no longer talked to her. She became the girl who steals. People would not trust her anymore. She became a loner.\n\nAnd during our graduation in 6th grade, I saw her alone on the side, while all of our classmates were busy taking group pictures. So I went up to her.\n\nMe: Hey Molly, why are you there? We\u2019re taking group pictures right now.\nMolly: But I have no friends. Because everybody thinks I\u2019m a loser.\nMe: Yeah... that sucks. Because you deserve it. Happy Graduation!\n\nI gave her a big smile and walked away. And that was the last time I saw her because I transferred to a private school.\n\nLast time I checked, she\u2019s now 22 with 3 kids under 3, and has an alcoholic boyfriend. And people still think she steals. So.",

            "selftext": "Edit: I have since fixed this post so to removed acronyms, it should now meet the requirements for this subject.\n\n\nlittle bit of backstory: I have ADHD and am slightly autistic (not a lot but just enough to be considered on the spectrum).  In this case I would have trouble reading someone\u2019s social cues, keeping my mouth shut, interrupt people, understand someone else\u2019s feelings and understanding/ conveying some emotions. I had little self confidence and always asked what I should do, even if it was my decision on things. Due to my autistic characteristics, sometimes use a \u201cbaby voice\u201d which was my voice becoming higher pitch/squeaky when I became anxious. Despite being slightly autistic I didn\u2019t struggle with grades, I worked hard despite having autism and gave it my all in every subject I had. Even though I didn\u2019t necessarily struggle with subject, at certain times of the day I asked questions... at times a lot of questions. So I sometimes would ask questions in a way that would answer what I really want to ask and not seem stupid.\n\nAnother bit of background is that the middle school I went to had thick stone walls and a berry heavy door. There could be a fight in the classrooms and you would barely hear anything in the hallways.\n\nThe Story:\n\nThough-out my school years, I had always had amazing teacher. My Mom and Dad were very involved with the school and as a result the teachers and the principals knew me. They didn\u2019t necessarily give me special treatment due to my disability or relationship with my family, but I still felt that they knew me better than most other students. \n\nEveryday around lunch, my morning medication wore off. I usually had go to the nurses office to take medication for my ADHD, as such I would come 2 to 3 minutes late to my 3rd block class. My 3rd block class was English. My teacher in that class understood that I had autism and wouldn\u2019t get upset when I asked obvious questions or was running a few minutes late to her class.\n\nOne day, I had just came from the nurses office and opened the door to my 3rd block class. At my English teacher\u2019s desk was a woman in her late forties, wearing a shirt with America on it. The class was usually louder than this since we had just came back for lunch, but it was dead silent. The woman, our substitute teacher, turned towards me with a very foul expression on her face\n\nEvil Substitute \u201cWhy are you late?\u201d\n\nAs previously mentioned I am slightly autistic and lack self confidence and back then I had the tendency to stutter and not look people in the eyes.\n\nMe \u201cI.. just came from the nurses office.\u201d\n\nEvil Substitute Are you sick?\u201d\n\nMe \u201cNo I just needed...\u201d\n\nEvil Substitute\u201cThen sit down.\u201d She said interrupting me.\n\nI sat down in my desk and class proceeded. I had never had a sub or teacher like this before, but I thought she might just be in a bad mood. After a few minutes, she passed out packets for us to work on, and the class began working on them. I looked at the title of the packet and it was for the book we were working on, but it was on the next chapter, not the one we had read yesterday. We hadn\u2019t done the packet on the previous chapter or read the chapter for the packet we were just given. I raised my hand.\n\nEvil Substitute \u201cYes?\u201d\n\nMe \u201cthis is for the next chapter, did you want us to read the chapter silently?\u201d\n\nEvil Substitute *Huff* \u201cYes\u201d.\n\nI was going to do that anyway, but this was my attempt at clarifying if the had meant to pass this out and not the previous chapters packet. I guess I broke the classes silent streak as several of my class mates would get up and ask her questions about the packet. I would get up twice and ask her questions, but the only replies she would give were, *Huff* \u201cjust read the book,\u201d or \u201cjust make a guess.\u201d The answer key was on the desk but she didn\u2019t make the effort to check. It was clear to everyone else that she was becoming agitated, but because I had trouble reading social cues, I didn\u2019t see it until it was too late.\n\nThe third time I got up she was already huffing. I wanted to ask her if this what kind of answer the question was asking without directly asking for the answer, but my brain got ahead of me.\n\nMe \u201cWould this be correct?\u201d\n\nEvil Substitute\u201cAre you seriously asking for me to give you the correct answer for you?\u201d\n\nI started to stutter when I tried to reply but she didn\u2019t give me the chance\n\nEvil Substitute\u201cHow do y\u2019all not understand, your the next generation of the world and your asking me these obvious questions?\u201d\n\nMe \u201cbut it\u2019s obvious to you because you know the answers.\u201d\n\nIn my mind, I was just making a statement about how she was more knowledgeable then us because she was an adult. However she had interpreted it as me saying that the only reason she knew the answers to the sheet is because she had seen the answer key (basically calling her stupid).\n\nThis. Set. Her. Off\n\nEvil Substitute \u201cI\u2019VE ALREADY GRADUATED, YALL SHOULD BE SMARTER THAN THIS BUT INSTEAD YOU KIDS ARE GOING TO END UP BEING THE RUINING OF AMERICA!\u201d\n\nThe class was silent, I went back to my seat and continued working, meanwhile she continued to go off on us but not yelling like the last outburst.\n\nThe bell rang and everyone in the class left. Most shrugged it off, others said they would tell their parents, but I was having none of it. I had always been the person to not get angry until I couldn\u2019t contain my anger, but in this case I was ready to explode. During the next block I asked the teacher of that class if I could talk to the counselor about something, and help me control my frustrations. She let me and I headed to the office. I wanted to tell the counselor about what had happened and maybe she could do something. I asked the woman in the office if I could talk to the counselor. She told me that the counselor was talking to the principal so just wait outside. My medication had kicked in my this point, and it couldn\u2019t have done so at a better time. As soon as she said that my eyes lit up. This. Was. Perfect.\n\nThe revenge:\n\nInside the principals office, the counselor was sure enough talking to the principal. I was told to wait outside, but My plan needed them both in there at the same time, I went in anyway. Inside, I tapped on the counselors back to get her attention.\n\nSchool Counselor \u201cI\u2019m in the middle of something, is there something you need?\n\nI made sure I close enough for the principal to hear my reply.\n\nMe \u201cYes.. could you and I talk about.. the hurtful things the sub said.\u201d\n\nThe plan went off without a hitch. I wanted her out of the school and never near a school again. Just as planned the principal intervened.\n\nPrincipal \u201cif you don\u2019t mind, could you explain what you meant by hateful things?\u201d\n\nAfter I explained what had happened, the principal called some of my classmates from my 3rd block to verify this. After others reported the same, and even new ones.\n\nThe next day, a my English teacher was back and the Substitute wasn\u2019t seen at the school again. It turns out that the Substitute was applying for a teaching job. I don\u2019t know all the details but I\u2019m fairly certain she didn\u2019t get it. In fact before I left the middle school, it turned out I had cost her not only getting the job here but in the district. \n\nI\u2019ve since graduated high school with honors and even got first place in a writing competition. I don\u2019t know what all happened to her, but even though she said all those things, I still hope she found a job and is better now.",

            "selftext": "So I've lurked for a long time and made a new account to post as I'm not comfortable on my other account. Anyways, a bit of backstory, I was 31, and worked at a  small computer manufacturer, making computers was hard work, my manager was 56 and was ready to retire, he did and this is where we got our new manager.\n\nHe'll be mm for maniac manager, \nI'm Me for obvious reasons\nMy friend is F\nCo worker is CW\nBoss is B\n\n\nSo MM was hired and instantly was evil to F and I, yet he treated CW like she was a queen.\n\nMM obviously didn't know  how to use a computer, much less manufacture one, he wanted to report F and I and DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO USE OUR COMMUNITY PAGE\n \n\nAt this point I didn't know how MM got the job, but the boss seemed to love him, I later found out they were good friends. No wonder.\nWhen my old manager was there ( shout out to you, you know who you are!) He promised me a 50$ raise! I was delighted, but the day after he told me about that, he gave in his two week notice and left before I got the raise. I was working for 60k a year, so not bad. But MM didn't want me to get the raise, he didn't give me the raise. I was pissed. I immediately told the boss, who also agreed to it. He said no, and acted like it never happened, he told me MY MENTAL HEALTH WAS PROBABLY OFF. Here is where the revenge comes in, I was working on a team of four, me CW, F and an other guy who had no part.\nI decided if I left, they would need to hire fast or would face a fall. Friend also didn't get a promised raise, CW wouldn't be able to handle both of our jobs for more than a week before getting overwhelmed, since MM loved CW he would want to help her and hire FAST. So I told friend, let leave and find another job, so we did. We found jobs at MetLife ( thanks MetLife) and we gave in a two week notice, this made MM scared. We eventually left. We kept tabs on the company, they hired two people to take our place, in 5 days, both spots were filled, with idiots. They didn't work well together and CW couldn't handle it and slacked. Now MM was in danger, he had to work a lot more. Both new people were tied, they begged for us back, we said \" pay us 75k a year\" they said no, now the company doesn't exist, we spread bad stuff they they didn't give raises. They couldn't replace the two, manager and CW couldn't hold all if the manufacturing, the company failed and the boss and MM had a hard time earning good money, they had to climb I'm the hierarchy, F and I got paid 70k a year now. Boss gets 35k or something like that, after getting 80k, he's at a game stop. ( I don't know what they pay) maybe this is petty revenge, but I liked that story, MM also is working at a McDonald's I think, he didn't have a friend to help him work at another tech company, he's 35.",

            "selftext": "A little bit of backstory: I have ADHD and am slightly autistic (not a lot but just enough to be considered on the spectrum).  In this case I would have trouble reading someone\u2019s social cues, keeping my mouth shut, interrupt people, understand someone else\u2019s feelings and understanding/ conveying some emotions. I had little self confidence and always asked what I should do, even if it was my decision on things. Due to my autistic characteristics, sometimes use a \u201cbaby voice\u201d which was my voice becoming higher pitch/squeaky when I became anxious. Despite being slightly autistic I didn\u2019t struggle with grades, I worked hard despite having autism and gave it my all in every subject I had. Even though I didn\u2019t necessarily struggle with subject, at certain times of the day I asked questions... at times a lot of questions. So I sometimes would ask questions in a way that would answer what I really want to ask and not seem stupid.\n\nAnother bit of background is that the middle school I went to had thick stone walls and a berry heavy door. There could be a fight in the classrooms and you would barely hear anything in the hallways.\n\nThe Story:\n\nThough-out my school years, I had always had amazing teacher. My Mom and Dad were very involved with the school and as a result the teachers and the principals knew me. They didn\u2019t necessarily give me special treatment due to my disability or relationship with my family, but I still felt that they knew me better than most other students. \n\nEveryday around lunch, my morning medication wore off. I usually had go to the nurses office to take medication for my ADHD, as such I would come 2 to 3 minutes late to my 3rd block class. My 3rd block class was English. My teacher in that class, let\u2019s call her Mrs. Davis, understood that I had autism and wouldn\u2019t get upset when I asked obvious questions or was running a few minutes late to her class.\n\nOne day, I had just came from the nurses office and opened the door to my 3rd block class. At Mrs. Davis\u2019s Desk was a woman in her late forties, wearing a shirt with America on it. The class was usually louder than this since we had just came back for lunch, but it was dead silent. The woman, our substitute teacher, turned towards me wi path a very foul expression on her face\n\nES (Entitled Substitute) \u201cWhy are you late?\u201d\n\nAs previously mentioned I am slightly autistic and lack self confidence and back then I had the tendency to stutter and not look people in the eyes.\n\nMe \u201cI.. just came from the nurses office.\u201d\n\nES \u201cAre you sick?\u201d\n\nMe \u201cNo I just needed...\u201d\n\nES \u201cThen sit down.\u201d She said interrupting me.\n\nI sat down in my desk and class proceeded. I had never had a sub or teacher like this before, but I thought she might just be in a bad mood.  After a few minutes, she passed out packets for us to work on, and the class began working on them. I looked at the title of the packet and it was for the book we were working on, but it was on the next chapter, not the one we had read yesterday. We hadn\u2019t done the packet on the previous chapter or read the chapter for the packet we were just given. I raised my hand.\n\nES \u201cYes?\u201d\n\nMe \u201cthis is for the next chapter, did you want us to read the chapter silently?\u201d\n\nES  *Huff* \u201cYes\u201d.\n\nI was going to do that anyway, but this was my attempt at clarifying if the had meant to pass this out and not the previous chapters packet. I guess I broke the classes silent streak as several of my class mates would get up and ask her questions about the packet. I would get up twice and ask her questions, but the only replies she would give were, *Huff* \u201cjust read the book,\u201d or \u201cjust make a guess.\u201d The answer key was on the desk but she didn\u2019t make the effort to check. It was clear to everyone else that she was becoming agitated, but because I had trouble reading social cues, I didn\u2019t see it until it was too late.\n\nThe third time I got up she was already huffing. I wanted to ask her if this what kind of answer the question was asking without directly asking for the answer, but my brain got ahead of me.\n\nMe \u201cWould this be correct?\u201d\n\nES \u201cAre you seriously asking for me to give you the correct answer for you?\u201d\n\nI started to stutter when I tried to reply but she didn\u2019t give me the chance\n\nES \u201cHow do y\u2019all not understand, your the next generation of the world and your asking me these obvious questions?\u201d\n\nMe \u201cbut it\u2019s obvious to you because you know the answers.\u201d\n\nIn my mind, I was just making a statement about how she was more knowledgeable then us because she was an adult. However she had interpreted it as me saying that the only reason she knew the answers to the sheet is because she had seen the answer key (basically calling her stupid).\n\nThis. Set. Her. Off\n\nES \u201cI\u2019VE ALREADY GRADUATED, YALL SHOULD BE SMARTER THAN THIS BUT INSTEAD YOU KIDS ARE GOING TO END UP BEING THE RUINING OF AMERICA!\u201d\n\nThe class was silent, I went back to my seat and continued working, meanwhile she continued to go off on us but not yelling like the last outburst.\n\nThe bell rang and everyone in the class left. Most shrugged it off, others said they would tell their parents, but I was having none of it. I had always been the person to not get angry until I couldn\u2019t contain my anger, but in this case I was ready to explode. During the next block I asked the teacher of that class if I could talk to the counselor about something, and help me control my frustrations. She let me and I headed to the office. I wanted to tell the counselor about what had happened and maybe she could do something. I asked the woman in the office if I could talk to the counselor. She told me that the counselor was talking to the principal so just wait outside. My medication had kicked in my this point, and it couldn\u2019t have done so at a better time. As soon as she said that my eyes lit up. This. Was. Perfect.\n\nThe revenge:\n\nInside the principals office, the counselor was sure enough talking to the principal. I went inside anyway. I tapped on the counselors back to get her attention \n\nSC (School\u2019s Counselor) \u201cI\u2019m in the middle of something, is there something you need?\n\nI made sure I close enough for the principal to hear my reply.\n\nMe \u201cYes.. could you and I talk about.. the hurtful things the sub said.\u201d\n\nThe plan went off without a hitch. Just as planned the principal intervened.\n\nAP (Awesome Principal) \u201cif you don\u2019t mind, could you explain what you meant by hateful things?\u201d\n\nAfter I explained what had happened, the principal called some of my classmates from my 3rd block to verify this, and I headed back to 4th block.\n\nThe next day, a Mrs. Davis was back and the Substitute wasn\u2019t seen at the school again. It turns out that the Substitute was applying for a teaching job. I don\u2019t know all the details but I\u2019m fairly certain she didn\u2019t get it.\n\nI\u2019ve since graduated high school with honors and even got first place in a writing competition. I don\u2019t know what all happened to her, but even though she said all those things, I still hope she found a job and is better now.",

            "selftext": "This happened a while back when I was a teenager in high school. I shared a room with my older cousin, let\u2019s call him Emmy, and I had taken out my birth certificate because I was using it to get my driver\u2019s permit. A few days after I got my permit, I put my birth certificate next to my bed in a folder.\n\nWhen I came home from school one day I didn\u2019t see my folder next my bed. I asked Emmy where my folder was, he said he was cleaning and threw it away. I told him my birth certificate was in there, his response: \u201cI don\u2019t care!\u201d\n\nI was so mad that I didn\u2019t ask him why he didn\u2019t care. I just wanted to get my certificate back. I looked and dug through trash to find it, but unfortunately I never did find it.\n\nA few days after that, I was watching television and a music video came on (yes, I\u2019m that old). When Emmy came down to sit next to me, he didn\u2019t like what was playing on the television. He grabbed the remote from my hands and changed the channel. I fought him for the remote, and he ran and told my brother I was disrespecting him. My brother Gabriel is way older than me, so he was like a surrogate father. He grounded me for a week for being \u201cdisrespectful\u201d towards Emmy. Gabriel didn\u2019t even give me a chance to tell my side. Needless to say, I was livid.\n\nA week passed and mail came for Emmy. He was upstairs sleeping from a night shift he worked. I saw that it was from the toll company for crossing the bridge. I opened it (that\u2019s bad, I know but I was pissed) and saw that he owed money. I knew it was him because I recognized the license plate of his car.\n\nSuddenly the idea dawned on me, I shredded the mail, throw it in the dumpster. For months, I kept an eye for the mail. He would sleep into the late afternoon, but the mail came in the early afternoon. So every time he got an invoice the toll company, I shred it and throw away. Until it got to the point where he had to appear in court, I shredded that too and throw away.\n\nEventually he got his license suspended until he paid the full amount plus the extra fees. It came up to a total of a few hundred dollars and having to jump through hoops to get the suspension off his license. He never knew it was me.\n\nAs for Gabriel, I bleached his favorite jeans.",

Sorry for the dog shit tittle. But whatever. There isn't a cast here because none of us remember what they said so there is no dialogue just a quick order.\n\nSo this started as any normal morning for my grandma. She got ready to sell fruit and left to where she would sell. It was in Hollywood near a park plus on a busy street so she would sell a good enough about to have enough for rent and stuff. I can't remember much (I'm not racist I am just repeating her words so sorry if this next part offends you) she said 2 black kids went to buy fruit and they got a big bag of watermelon and melon. She asked if they wanted salt and lemon or tajin and they said yes. While she grabbed it they got the tajin and threw it in her eyes and the lemon too. They ran off and luckily she always has a bucket of water with her (for sanitary reasons) and she quickly washed her eyes and face. She is from Mexico but she is actually very smart and even though she is old, her eyesight is just fine for seeing from afar. She followed them home and called the police. She told them what had happened and I know that they arrested them. From there I don't know what happened but I would have loved to press charges but she didn't want to (I have no reason why) from there only 2 other things have happened.\n\nSorry if this did not meet anyone expectations for something that is pro revenge but I just felt like someone had to know because I can't let this go to waste.",

            "selftext": "Obligatory on mobile\n\nA few weeks ago, our jome had a small ritual party on co-relation with our religion, hinduism. My mom was bery excited as it was her first since becoming ill after movkng to India. We had a new neighbour so we decided to call her over. She seemes obnoxious but I thoigh O was silly and not to judge her. She asked my mom why she did not participate in the society's activities and my mom told her about her illness.\n\nEntitled Lady took it as an advantage. Our Society has a no-tolerance policy for filth caused by owners and her dog has some serious bowel problems so, to escape the fine, EL would scoop up her dog's shit and put it in front of our home.  For the first few days we had to pay the fine as, our security system was gone for modifying. The day it returned, we caught her in the act and decided to take out a confession from her. She lied and acted like a Karen, stating that she was on a low wage job and could not afford paying the fine for her dog al the while paying around 700$ as rent that was \"sent by her parents.\" \n\nThis continued and we showed the cleaning company the footage yet WE had to pay the fine since it was our front door and we had to tell her to stop so not their problem.\n\nNow for the revenge, I aspire to be a physicist so, I spend a lot of time seeing scoence videos. One of the videos was about Hooke's law ( a scientific theory upon the spring and it's usage and properties) and an idea came to me that I could use this to tackle this fine problem. I took a cardboard box and fixed a big spring from a previous car we had and fixed it inside the cardboard so that, whenever any weight was put upon it and equal and opposite reaction would be put in place. Her dog's dokkies weighed a lot. The next day, she put the dookie on the inside the cardboard thinking it would be funny as I had put a don't use sign on it so she would do that, and guess what, SMACK, straight on to the face. She then called the secretary of the society and we showed him tje footage so her complain backfired. She was removed from her home a few days ago becuase she jad not payed two month's rent because all the money her parents gave her, she'd throw away into lavosh parties and items. She is on welfare now as her parents disowned her. Karma is a b***h. \n\nTl:dr: Lady put shit in front of my frpnt door, got her life destroyed. Life shat on her",

            "selftext": "I had been friends with (let's just call him Paul Blart) since the fifth grade. He was always getting bullied in school because of his excessive weight, but I always stuck with him. We had our disagreements but we always made up. That was until high school at least. For the first time in forever Blart finally made some friends and one of them was a guy named Mike (not his real name). Now mike was a bit of a douche, he was always messing with me and a few others in various ways. But he always did it in such a way that it was impossible to report him to the teachers, because what he was doing wasn't technically \"bullying\".  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBlart and I were still friends though and despite Mikes efforts to separate us, we stayed that way.  Or at least that's what it seemed like to me. We were nearing the end of the year when our teacher announced that we would be working on a group project. To my surprise, Blart chose to partner with Mike. I didn't have a problem with it and just picked some random guy to work with.  Random guy didn't do anything to contribute to the project and left me to do it all by myself. I actually didn't have a problem with that because I enjoyed working alone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   Come the day before the presentation and Blart gives me a call asking me to help revise his and Mikes project. I accepted and an hour later I arrived at his doorstep, mike was not with him. It turned out that he lost his project and needed to use mine. He said that he would heavily modify it, and after seeing what he did with the first paragraph I believed him. I gave him the USB It was stored on so he could copy it onto his laptop. He finished and I left his house. But when I put the USB into my desktop it was empty. I assumed it was a mistake and called him. He didn't answer. I sent him texts, but he didn't respond. I was panicking when I remembered I still had the rough draft saved on my computer. I put that on the USB and went to sleep, praying that I would still get credit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   When it was time for the presentation Blart eagerly volunteered to go first, with Mike at his side. Mike had the most shit-faced grin on his face as he walked to the front. I raised my hand mid-presentation and declared that they stole my project. The teacher was shocked, but Blart made up some bullshit excuse about ME stealing THEIR project. AND THE FUCKING TEACHER BELIEVED THEM. SHE FUCKING BELIEVED THEM. I was sent to the principals' office and ended up failing that class because of him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   Later in the day our history teacher also said that we would do a group presentation, but now I had an idea. I waited till the day before the presentation and called his mom to tell her that I left something at his house and needed to come over. I went to his house and found that he wasn't here. I opened his laptop and looked through the presentation (the USB was in the laptop). You see the teacher made it mandatory that we include a video to go with our presentation. I searched his presentation until I found the link and then proceeded to replace it with a link to a, particularly explicit porno. I left to go home and had the best sleep of my life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPresentation day came and he walked up to the board. I was sitting in the back and could barely contain my excitement. He presented as normal until he reached the link. He clicked on it only for the classroom to be filled with extremely loud moaning. The teacher went insane and nearly broke his laptop while trying to turn it off. He was immediately sent to the principals' office and was expelled from the school. It. Was. Glorius.",

            "selftext": "So this happened years ago. Me and my younger brother were like, 15 and 11. Anyways, we didn\u2019t get along very well growing up, he would always do anything in his power to be as big a pest as possible. Anyways we had to share a bathroom and while getting ready for school he\u2019d turn it into a god damn gas chamber with all the axe deodorant he used. One day I asked him to use a little less so that way my eyes don\u2019t water while I\u2019m trying to brush my teeth. His response was to spray me in the face. Our house quickly became a chemical war zone with him waiting around corners to fill my nostrils with toxic fumes. One particular attack happened while I was leaving my room, he sat at my door spraying me every time I tried to leave. Mom wasn\u2019t home, so I took matters into my own hands. I slowly opened my door and stuck my head out and, right on cue, got pepper sprayed with antiperspirant. I put on the biggest show of my life, crying, coughing, and spitting up everywhere. Finally I fell over, choking on the floor convulsing, saying that I was having an asthma attack (I\u2019ve had it all my life and he knew it, but he\u2019d never seen me have an attack). He began panicking and sprinted downstairs to get my rescue inhaler and some water, screaming the entire way. Once he was gone I got up and hid behind the door. He came into my room still crying and I jumped out behind him. He screamed and spilled the water all over himself. Needless to say he was pretty pissed, but I think I deserve an Oscar for that performance as he never used that shitty spray on me again.",

            "selftext": "Tl;dr at the bottom. This happened between late 2014-early 2015. I worked at a popular store that sells designer sunglasses. They are generally between 200-300 USD for one pair.\n\nWhen I started at the store, I really liked my manager. He was always buying me Starbucks and hyping me up. We clicked really well together and he passed over people that had been there much longer than me to give me basically full time hours, and I also had another retail job, so I was basically writing my own schedule there around my other schedule at the other store. He told me that once our store hits $800k in sales that will open up an assistant manager position, and it\u2019s mine when that happens. Everything was awesome! Or so I thought. It turns out that assistant manager position was a lie, and he just said that to get me to quit my other job, which I eventually did.\n\nI honestly don\u2019t know what I did to get on his bad side, but over time I noticed he just didn\u2019t like me like he used to. He treated me like the other employees, maybe a little worse, but not to the point that it was worth addressing and I figured it would work itself out. I even turned down a seasonal side job (acting in a haunted house) that I look forward to every year at his request, when the schedules would have barely overlapped and I absolutely could have done both- he just made it seem like I couldn\u2019t.\n\nEach morning and night we would count the glasses, during the day keep a tally on what was sold/returned, and that would allow us to track theft. Our counts were ALWAYS off. It drove me crazy, and I noticed that he would almost never count the glasses in the morning! He would either just transfer the numbers from the night before without counting or just wait until someone else came in and have them count. Transferring the numbers is bad because if there was a miscount the night before, the following night it\u2019ll either look like there was a theft, or we have too many, which is also bad.\n\nHoliday season began. The day before Thanksgiving (the year that thanksgiving shopping was HUGE) I was supposed to work an opening shift and he was supposed to close, with our shifts overlapping so we could plan for the following day. It was snowing, so he decided not to come in. So I worked a double, alone, with two MASSIVE shipments (for sunglasses it is tedious and time consuming) / general to do list of tasks that we were behind on, to prepare our store for thanksgiving/Black Friday. Keep in mind- I\u2019m not a manager. Over the remainder of the holiday season when the mall was open from 8AM to 11PM, he only worked mid-shifts, would often take the weekends off, and often worked less than 30 hours a week. In retail, that\u2019s fucked up. If you\u2019re a store manager, you want to be opening or closing on at least one weekend day, every weekend, unless you have something else going on. I\u2019m not a total hard ass, that\u2019s just a commitment that comes with managing a retail store. He was salaried, so I know the hours thing is time theft. My district manager came in on a surprise visit while I was there alone and looked at the time sheets. She told me to just buck up and deal with it, that he should be working more hours, but he can schedule how he wants. Ok, sure.\n\nA few months later I\u2019m working a Saturday morning alone, and an older gentleman comes to return a $300 pair of sunglasses that he paid cash for. I go to ring it into the computer, and it comes up as a sale that has already been returned. The man has the case and receipt, so it doesn\u2019t look like he returned it and then came back, stole another pair, and tried to return it again (it\u2019s happened). I call another store just in case they have had something similar happen and she tells me that I should look up the date of the return and go through that day\u2019s paperwork and check out the return receipts. I do. I compare the customer signature on the receipt with his license, completely different. I also happened to notice that the signature on the receipt was very heavy-handed, like my manager, who presses down extremely hard when he writes. I call my district manager and ask her what to do, she tells me to just refund the guy and she\u2019ll come over to deal with it. I check the cameras from the time and day of the return- there was my manager, standing alone at the register. We ended up reviewing every cash return that occurred within the past year and found several other falsified cash returns that he had done and pocketed the money from. I\u2019m not sure if they ended up prosecuting, but he was fired shortly after and I got a reward.\n\nHe most likely stole merchandise too (hence the counts never being accurate) but we didn\u2019t have the time to review the camera footage like that, and we already knew he would be fired anyways so fuck it I guess.\n\nTl;dr I had a shitty and irresponsible retail manager, and then caught him falsifying cash returns and got him fired.",

            "selftext": "Ok, gonna be honest this probably doesn't belong here and won't get featured on YouTube or anything, but I couldn't find a Sub for small revenge stories. So here goes...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was this one kid at my school who we will call Sam. Sam was your typical bully who got away with everything since the teachers seemed to love him. Everybody seemed to love him, really. The only problem was that he always made fun of the weird kids. I, unfortunately, was a weird kid and so were my friends. He was a small dude, smaller than me at the time at least. He liked to pick on me and my other weird friend especially. One day, I snapped. He made fun of my friends laugh for being like a a girl and saying he was gay. Now, you know how I told you I was bigger then him? I was also bigger then anybody at the school. I calmly walked up to the kid, pushed him to the ground and then picked him up by his shirt. I held his shirt like in those movies, and told him these words while he was looking at me with a wild face: \"I swear to god, If you do that again, I will break every bone in your body.\"... And let go of his shirt so he fell again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe stopped bullying my friend after that, but not me. Seems as if he didn't get the message. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am not really one for hurting people, but I went out of my way to make his life HELL. I tripped him every chance I could, made fun of his laugh and his weird nails and other things of the such. Then, I learned of something that could make this revenge story WAY better. I saw him during a test, with his phone out, calling his girlfriend. After the test, I told the teacher that I saw him with his phone out talking to somebody. It would've been bad enough getting in trouble for calling somebody, but when he was asked to pull open his phone it had answers to the test. His photo's app was open and he had taken a picture of the answer key. Several other photos of other test keys were found, and he had to take summer school because of the amount of tests he failed. The teachers didn't like him anymore, he had lost his girlfriend since he had been calling HER, and he was made fun of from then on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe was popular again the next year, but he had definitely been knocked down a few pegs. I like to think I made those 3 months of his life a living hell like he did me and my friend. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother story here, but smaller. The next year I had found his locker door ajar, and got ahold of his phone. Guess who he was dating again? The same girl from last year. I sent her a text from his phone talking about dating another girl and then making it seem like he had the wrong number. This made her think that he was cheating, and it turns out he really WAS cheating with **3** girls. He was knocked down a few **more** pegs before the summer started. Not sure how he is gonna do next year....",

One day I see (N) and (J) hanging out so I went over to say what's up, the first thing that (J) does when he see's me is give me one of those typical keren smirks (I haven't done anything to him sense  I've known him) I didn't realy care a bout the keren smirk.\nOne day (N) invited me over to her house. So I rode my bike over to her house, I got there and (N) let me in we were on our phones when we need a knock at the door (N) goes to see who it is, and in walks (J) I didn't really care at the time but when (N) walked away to the bathroom (J) kept threatening me to stay away from (N) or he would find out where I lived and beat my ass with some of his friends, then he went on bragging  about how she would never be with me and how he's soooo lucky that he's with (N) I was done with thirdwhelling and i was done with his bullshit, so when (N) got back (J) was being buddy,buddy with me and I wasn't having any of it, so the next time Me (J) and (N) hangout I put my phone to record all sound Intel I turned it off but when (N) went to do something (I didn't know what) (J) started talking to me about how he was cheating on my Friend(N) with his ex(Q), and then he was going to break up with (N)  just so he could be with (Q) (she was in 3 of my classes at the time) and then he started to rant again about how (N)s with him and not me, ect. \n(N) got back from what she was doing, I was mad as hell that (J) was cheating on (N) (I still had my phone recording), so I go home at about 7:45pm\nAnd I sent the voice recordings to everyone I knew at school and told them to send it to other people also, and it was sent to almost the whole school in about 1.5hours the next day was a train wreck for (J)  no one would talk to him and I guess that's what you get when you mess with my friend.\n\nBTW: I,m now dating (N) and have been for 3.4years as of right now. Thanks for ratting yourself out (J)",

            "selftext": "So to start things off I live in a very old apartment that was converted to so 20 or so years ago. It was built in the late 1800s before my town was even there so it is an old farmhouse. It\u2019s very small and my apartment is basically the attic. It has almost no insulation to the outside walls, and none between the floors. It being so old it\u2019s not surprising, however there is a small problem with it being an apartment. Noise. \nMy downstairs neighbor has a roommate, I know him from work and he actually used to live in the apartment I do now, But that is another matter. All you need to know is he expected me to move out when he was kicked out of his gfs house and was pissed when I didn\u2019t. Anyways he is not a good person or neighbor, he is constantly playing music or tv wayyyyy louder than is needed. It being a badly designed apartment I tried to just let it pass as to not create an incident, only saying something if it wakes me up from sleep or I can hear his stuff over my tv.\nI had contacted my landlord a couple times and complained but to no real affect, my neighbor would say something along the lines of \u201cI don\u2019t know what he is talking about I\u2019m usually quiet and I wouldn\u2019t do something like that\u201d So I decided to take things into my own hands. I bought a VERY loud air horn. \nSo for a few days if he had gotten too loud I would give a quick blast from the air horn. Sometimes it would quiet him down, sometimes not. So I started going to the bottom of the stairs To my apartment where there is only a thin plaster wall and blaring the horn there. THAT got his attention. I did this 2 times before I got a call from the landlord. My response when asked about the air horn? \u201cI don\u2019t know what he is talking about I\u2019m usually quiet and I wouldn\u2019t do something like that\u201d. My landlord just laughed and said okay, as he can\u2019t stand the neighbor either. \nSo for the last 3 months, whenever I am feeling down or depressed or just angry I will go down and give a quick blast from the air horn. It is very effective at making my mood better and happier. It is even better knowing that he sleeps right next to that wall and he is asleep when I am home from work now, so it wakes him up each time. Life is good now!",

            "selftext": "So this happened a few years back when I was in college.\n\nI applied for the job when I was half way through my studies after deciding I needed some extra income and landed a part-time job at a discount supermarket company one town over stacking shelves and working the checkout.  My first few weeks there were great good people and even my supervisors were helpful whenever I had a problem.\n\nEnter the manger we'll call her Karen (she even had the haircut). Karen had been there about 5 years before me and had become very friendly with the area manager so most complaints about her where just either ignored or never went any further.\n\nI went through hell as she forced me to work overtime and come in on days off even trying to get me to come in a few times when I was on holdiay stating\n\n \"nobody else is available and you know you need the money, I've seen what you dress in and it's not the greatest\"\n\nI wear things like band tees and skinny jeans, and dc shoes when I'm not at work.\n\nShe used to give me tasks that she had to do around the shop with ridiculous time constraints like making sure an entire 70ft aisle was organised and clean within 10 mins. Some where even her jobs, and the entire time watched me on the cameras whilst stuffing her face and being on the phone to her friends.\n\nTo top it all off she was a full on feminazi. I don't have anything wrong with women wanting equal rights but she was on an entirely new level. Making it very clear to us that men are demons and women don't need us to do anything. So me and my friends all get the harder jobs with no help just for being our gender, and whenever a new supervisor job opened up she would always hire her favourite girl or one of her friends who had little to no experience. She even had the audacity to try and accuse me of trying to hit on the female co-workers without any proof just if they asked for a hand all the while knowing I had a gf, even though the cameras audio picked up the conversation.\n\nOne day I got sick and turned out I had actually got appendicitis which had actually got to the point of my appendix bursting and going gangerous putting me in the hospital for emergency surgery. My mum had been the one to phone in for me a couple of days before being admitted to the hospital as I was so ill I could barely speak or stand.\n\nA few days into my recovery my mum comes to visit me with pure rage and tears in her eyes, I asked what was wrong and she told me she'd gone into the store I worked at for a few things and bumped in to Karen.\n\n\"When is OP coming back there's a lot to do and he needs to be here\"\n\n\"I'm sorry he got admitted to hospital with appendicitis and is going to be off for a few weeks at least. I spoke to one of the supervisors and they said it was ok\"\n\n\"Yeah they told me and I know he's faking it, all men fake illness when they don't want to work. He's only doing it so he doesn't have to come in.\"\n\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\n\"They all do it honey even if it means putting stress on the healthcare system. You know what I mean, just tell him as soon as he's done faking his illness he must come straight back to work\"\n\nI'd had enough at this point I requested a transfer to the store the company had in my home town as a position had just become available. Unfortunately it would be nearly 4 months before the transfer would be authorised, which meant I had to deal Karen's bullshit for another few months after I was well enough to work again.\n\nWhen Karen heard I had requested a transfer she made sure to be the biggest bitch possible to me when I got back, giving me ridiculous tasks and not allowing me to even go on a break until they were all finished.\n\nThe day finally comes to sign the paperwork for my transfer and as she signs her name she stares at me and says\n\n \"you are never going to be allowed back in my store so don't even think about coming back\" \n\nI just grabbed the paper and left without a word. I did start to enjoy my job at the new store the manager was more down to earth and we even had a new area manager as the other one had retired.\n\nI got along well with the new area manager and she was always impressed with how I worked and gave me her business number saying if I ever need something just ring.\n\nThat's where the prorevenge idea came into my head.\n\nI had always kept in touch with people from the old store and they'd been telling me how bad things had been getting since I left. Karen had basically been a bitch to all of them since I'd left.\n\nA couple months later I had found a new job and had invited my friends for a few drinks to celebrate where I found out she was still working as the manager and making there lives hell. So I came up with an idea and asked my friends to text me next time they were all in with Karen.\n\nA few days later I get the text. Revenge time.\n\nI wander back into the store that I had left years ago and not been back since. Nothing had changed. Good.\n\nI wander down the aisles making out I'm looking for something whilst making sure I'm on all the cameras. Not more than 2 minutes later Karen comes storming out of the back and heading straight for me.\n\n\"What the fuck are you doing here?\"\n\n\"I was just in the area and needed to pick up a few things\"\n\n\"Your not allowed in MY store\"\n\n\"Why have I done something wrong?\" \n\n\"Don't play fucking dumb you dick you know what I told you when you left\"\n\nI knew I had her at this point but I really wanted to keep her going just a little longer plus I wanted to make sure the cameras we're getting a good show.\n\n\"I understand that but I am a customer right now\"\n\n\"You are not in my store so get the fuck out now, otherwise, I'm calling your manager and getting you fired\"\n\n\"My manager what for?\" \n\n\"I'm going to tell them I caught you stealing and get you fired and maybe even arrested\"\n\n\"But you don't have any proof\" \n\n\"I can make out the cameras went down and get you fired unless you leave right fucking now\"\n\nShe'd gone so red in the face I thought now would be the great time to drop the bombshell.\n\n\"Ok I'm going but there's one problem with your plan\"\n\n\"WHAT?!\"\n\n\"I don't work for the company anymore bitch\"\n\nMy grin must have been from ear to ear when I said that because her face went red to white in less than a second. Her rage turning to panic. \n\nI wandered out of the store, my friends fist bumping me on the way out head held high, and pulled my phone out and rang the area manager to tell her what just happened. Area manager is pissed and tells me to wait there as she's only 5 mins away at the other store. \n\nPerfect.  \n\nThe area manager asks me to follow her inside to where she takes me into the back and we find Karen desperately trying to wipe the CCTV footage of our conversation. Big oof. I watch as the area manager tears Karen a new one with a giant smile on my face. The area manager turned to me and said if anyone else had heard the conversation. I go to the shop floor to gather my friends each saying relaying the conversation to the area manager word for word. She turns to me telling me to wait on the shop floor while she deals with Karen.\n\nNot 10 mins later HR for the entire company and the regional manager turn up and go into the office. I talk with my friends laughing and joking about what's about to happen when the HR comes out and asks me the question I'd been waiting for \"Do you want to press charges for her threatening behavior\" my answer is a resounding \"yes\" . I watch as Karen is escorted out of the building by police the area manager, regional manager, and HR me and my friends just wave to her from the window and she sobs as she's being placed in the back of the cop car.\n\nI'm now doing really well in my new job and my friends who still work there say the entire higher ups at the store were background checked and the ones who Karen had hired with no experience were demoted to shop staff and some of my friends were offered the jobs they had lost. I'm treated as a legend within the store now as the guy who got Karen arrested.",

But my sister told him that she didn\u2019t want HIM to do anything, since she didn\u2019t want him in jail. \n\nSo my dad quickly, contacted some old friends in gangs and told them everything.

My oldest sister\u2019s stepdad was beaten so bad, he barely recovered. \nHer stepdad and mom seperated not long after. \n\nMy dad made sure to call his work and tell them everything, got him fired. \n\nMy dad made sure to know everything about this \u201cman\u201d, so he could ruin his life as much as possible. \n\nWhen he got to a new city, and my dad got word of it, he made sure he got another extra beating or two.\n\nThis went on for YEARS on end. \n\nMy dad was told a few years ago, that he sits in a wheelchair now, and can barely do anything by himself.\n\nHe\u2019s still not satisfied, if it were up to him, he would be dead.\n\nNo one hurts his children.\n\n\nMy oldest sister haven\u2019t really had any real relationship, and lives with her best friend and a cat.

            "selftext": "This story is about my cousin who lives in London. I stayed with him, his brother and my aunt for a while because I did some of my higher studies in there(Im from India).\n\nSo when I was there my cousin was around 17 and he worked in a restaurant as a waiter. He worked in one of a high end restaurant operating in London. And the pay was very good too. My cousin, as far as I know is a great guy and one of the very few humans who develop good attitude towards life in a small age itself. I have never seen him stress about an issue no matter how big. Even recently he got a girl pregnant by accident and when tried to calm him down thinking he would be stressed. He simply said \"Guess we are gonna have a half black half caramel baby\"(his gf is of nigerian roots). We used to smoke a lot of pot in his house when everyone sleeps and we bonded through weed. \n \nSo one day he was pretty pissed when he got back from work and we rarely see him pissed. When asked about it he said its nothing but at night he spilled it to me. A family of 5,(Mom, dad, 2 daughters around 18 and a son around 10) came into the restaurant and ate good and drank wine worth quite a lot of money. The bill was around half his montly salary and the family basically left without paying. They actually planned the escape because all the women left first and then the guys went to the bathroom one by one and dissapeared too. My poor cousin went to the bathroom to check if they were there but they were already gone. \n\nCousin got shouted at badly by the manager and his salary got cut towards the bill amount. He was planning to get a car that time and this was a small hitch. He wanted to do something about it. But he's clueless and said \"Ah fuck it who cares\"\nHe also mentioned the girls were keeping on taking pictures of every single dish and posting on social media then and there and taking pictures of themselves with the food too. \n\nThis made me think and asked him if he can identify them if I showed their pictures. He also got what I meant that instant and we took our phones out and started searching hastags. This dumb ones uploaded in instagram and facebook with hastags of that restaurant and names of dishes. It was not hard to find them. \n\nThen it was not very difficult to find where they were going because they were geoatagging everyplace they go to. We started tracking them and soon enough they were in a mall near us. Me and my cousin ran to the place since its only a km away. And the trash girls were only there without their mother but with friends. And my cousin recognised them and we went to the same cafe as them and sat nearby. They didnt recognise him suprisingly. We just sat there and listened to their talks. They were loud af like most trashy teenagers. Then cousin noticed they are holding keys to the car and since its a gift from their beloved dad(insta stalking) and we already knew the number it was not hard to find. \n\nBut for our surprise when we were walking out we saw their car which had its 4 tires slashes and key marks all over the hood and side doors. It was parked at the other end where people don't notice stuff easily and assialants were wearing well covered hoodies so they didnt get caught in the cctv either. We did wait for the girls to come out and see their car. It was a very pleasant thing to see their reactions. Then we went home and smoked a joint praising the strangers who destroyed their car. \n\nPs. I know i missed a lot of details here and there. Didnt mean to and dont have time for proof reading because im near my stop in the bus. Ok bye\nSorry for the spelling errors too",

            "selftext": "In college I rented a 3-bedroom house with two other guys. We all worked and attended university. We had decided that the guy with the master suite also got to park in the driveway and paid half, rather than a third, of the rent. The others parked on the street in front of the house. It was an easy agreement to stick to. We were all ex-military so we had no problem sticking to agreements or schedules. \n\nAfter we had been there for a month or so and had established our work and school routines, we met our neighbors. The neighbors were an older couple with their grown daughter in her mid-late twenties. We met when one night when we were all home, we got this pounding on the front door like cops serving a drug warrant. ^((back when cops had balls)^).\n\nWe all answered the door to find out neighbor, drunk off his ass screaming at us for parking in front of our house. A true WTF moment. As we watch his unintelligible tirade, Mike (one of my roommates) got our attention and nodded towards the front yard. Low and behold, there sat a *Coupe De Ville* where no *Coupe De Ville* had been before. Steve (the other roommate), a recently discharged Air Force cop and current reserve deputy, grabs the phone and runs to the back of the house. Mike and I looked from the neighbor to Steve wondering  *\u201cWFT is he doing?\u201d* in both cases. \n\n Steve come back and a few seconds later we see red and blue flashing lights coming down the street in both directions. The neighbor see this and runs into his house. His wife comes out and moves the car as the police pull up. The cops talk to her and she gave some lame excuse about her husband needing to use the restroom and parked poorly\u2026 and blamed US for the commotion.  Steve did file a harassment complaint because the cop did see the wife moving the car, and we all thought that this was only the beginning.\n\nHow right we were.\n\nThe bang-n-bitch continued for a few months whenever we were all home. We had noticed the pattern a few week earlier. When Mike or I were at work we would notice the caddy parked in front of our house. We also noticed that the wife and daughter would move the caddy before they went to bed most nights. When he started dumping trash on our cars smearing stuff on our windshields we started fighting back. \n\nAt first we tried talking to the wife and daughter. They took his side and said we had no right to park on a city street in front of our house because we were  **\u201drenters\u201d**. It didn\u2019t get any better. \n\nOne day my boss announces that he just bought a limousine for the bar. However, it needed work before it could be used. I asked if I could borrow it while he waited for the shop to open a slot to work it in.\n\nI parked it in front of my neighbor\u2019s house for a week. \n\nThey tried to have it towed as an abandoned car claiming it was there for over a month. The cop was skeptical about that. I went out with the bill of sale and the pending registration and claimed the car as mine and this I had just parked it that afternoon. He told them the limo was fine on the street and cited them for filing a false police report. He did it again four days later when the called the city towing company to tow an abandoned car. The drunk neighbor side swiped it with his caddy and then took a tire iron to it\u2026 and got caught by the same cop. My boss laughed his ass off. All the previous damage toe car would now be repaired and restored to original status at my drunk neighbor\u2019s expense in the form of a $30,000 second mortgage.\n\nOne day I was in a burger king when I noticed my drunk neighbor leaving a little bar about a mile straight down the road from our houses. I called in a drunk driver from the pay phone. He was caught right in front of his house. First DUI. The following week I did it again\u2026 DUI #2. That same week I paid woman with two small children $20 to call and *\u201dSELL IT\u201d*\u2026. DUI #3 in ten-days\u2026. They took his car. By now Mike and Steve are involved and taking turns watching for him to leave the bar. Ten-days after DUI #3 Mike sees him leaving in his daughter\u2019s car\u2026 DUI #4, they took that car too. \n\nGetting 4 DUI\u2019s in three weeks gets the judge\u2019s attention. He refused to release the cars. So when he got DUI #5 they kept him and the car BOTH. Five severe DUI\u2019s in a month is a serious issue for the court. The judge released the wife\u2019s and daughter\u2019s cars with major fines and had them all sign a document that if he drove either of them again he was to be charged with Grand Theft. He ended up doing 45 days in a rehab unit before being release on parole. He had to finish his 18 month sentence on weekends. \n\nWe had showed up in court for his trial and each got fined $100 for contempt of court for high-fiving each other when he plead guilty and took the plea deal. When the judge called us out for contempt, he asked what our problem was and Steve told him we are the ones that called for each and every one of his DUI\u2019s. We thought of it as a community service. He thanked us and then lowered the fine from $1,000 to $100 and told us to leave. On the way out, with police escorts, Mike said we would be lucky if the wife didn\u2019t burn our house down.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the wife. \n\nHe stayed clean for a few weeks and then figured he could walk to the bar from home. As long as he wasn\u2019t driving and banging on our door, we didn\u2019t care. One night when we were celebrating Steve getting accepted to law school. We had our girl friends over for dinner some shenanigans. Later, the court psychiatrist said that the sound of us having a good time triggered him. \n\nSuddenly we smelt gasoline coming in the window off of the back deck. When I looked out I saw him pouring gas on our deck and splashing it on the side of the house. When I yelled at him, he ran off\u2026 home to be exact. Steve called police and fire. Mike and I got the girls out and started hosing down all the wood we could see.\n\nThe police found the gas can on his front porch and him in his kitchen with gas soaked pants. The found the wife in the garage disassembling Molotov cocktails she planned on using to start the fire. \n\nThis time we didn\u2019t get charged with contempt when they got sentenced. Both the husband and wife received prison sentenced of 25-life. They were each charged with 6-counts attempted murder; several counts of arson including arson of an occupied building. \n\nWe stayed in the house for about year afterwards. I never learned what happened to the daughter. She disappeared when she got her car out of impound. With all the loans on it, the house fell back to the bank and stayed vacant for 9 or more years, then some squatters started a fire to stay warm and burned the house down.",

            "selftext": "This was a time in my life when, I was honestly pretty fucked up. I was 16 then, and my parents were pretty well off. They decided to ship me off to a private boarding school for a year to see how id like it. Not saying it wasn't completely bad, but the friends i made made were no compromise for the facility itself. I had my fair share of problems like any normal high school kid. It all started as a typical senior on an a-typical year. I had just finished the summer after my Junior of high school. Public school was pretty rough as I always got picked on for being a \"nerd\". After I came home from the last day of work, my parents called me on my Nokia flip phone (as smartphone weren't around yet) asking me when the soonest i could be home was, they had \"exciting news\". I told them I just finished at work and it would be around a hour before i got home. We hung up and they waited for me in the living room, when i got in the door they greeted me and asked me how my last day of work was. I told them fine and my boss wanted me to work though the following school year if i could. We sat down to eat as we usually do, when they broke the news they found this \"amazing\" tuition program in northern Connecticut. They said how the website showed these amazing pictures and it was basically a summer camp for a school. But boy how looks were deceiving!!! We ended up agreeing on me trying it for a year, and my parents ended up putting a down payment (which was a rather large sum up money) to hold my spot for the year. Everything seemed great in concept until the time came to view the facility the weekend of my arrival. I went in with an optimistic feel thinking everything would be great if i stuck it out and went along with it. Of course it would get me out of the house and i would get to travel, since as a teen i was limited to a bike. At first we did the norm, went into the admissions office, got checked in and met the other teachers. However after I found out where i was living for the school year, and talked to some of the other students, something seemed a little off. I said goodbye to my parents and they said they would call me next week. I start to get settled in the dorm, and a staff walks in,we'll call him \"GR\". Now the way the school was organized so i found out later were there were the teachers for the school and supervisors, and other staff the run the facility. GR seemed nice at first, helped me unpack and unload my suitcase. However what he did next still urked me to this day. I was texting my grandmother on my cell phone, telling her i arrived at this new boarding school and how i was settling in. mid-text GR snags my phone, and rambles some shit about not having contraband. Immediately I opened up on him, and tried to grab my phone. Because of course any normal person would have done the same from anyone stealing another's electronic device. As i was fuming over the fact that this man stole my phone, MINE! I didn't realize the fact that GR had called in 2 other supporting staff to manhandle and restrain me. After this incident was all said and done, I truly realized the weight of what just occurred sinking in. My initial assumptions and fears came to pass, it was really to good to be true...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2 months later...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy this point I was settled in, as the place i now called home was as much of a sham as other kids explained it prior to my encounter with GR.  They're were many rules and restrictions put into place on what we could and couldn't say or do, at this point I couldn't even leave campus as that was a privilege reserved for only certain students who earned it thru good behavior. At this time i didn't even know what to do, they took all my books, electronics, and anything else of sentimental value and locked it in a closet in my dorm the day I arrived. We were only allowed access to a certain amount of cloths shoes and other objects, as the school had a rigid dress policy for uniforms only. I had made my circle of friends by this point in my stay, and wondering wtf I was even doing here? Most if not all the kids there were messed up with or disorders, or there for drug use. I have never had any such issues or problems of that kind in my life which i am fortunate. But given that i was thrown into the mix with recovering alcoholics, i needed to do something to get out here quick. Another month passed and i was allowed my first monitored call with my parents. My social worker clara oversaw the majority of these calls, and she was a total bitch. Anytime i would ever try to tell my parents about how bad the school was and what was going on clara would instantly hang up the phone, and proceed to end the call for that week. Not only did i find out this would happen whenever you talked shit about the school, but the school administration was feeding my parents bullshit about how great of a time i was having and all the friends i was making. They stole my phone so i couldn't tell my parents the truth. Cut off and sick of being played the fool, I decided enough was enough. I decided to form a plan that i could slowly exact my revenge over the rest of my stay at this school.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt started out painless enough, simple pranks here and there, hiding the staffs keys and taking extra long to finish my tests (the tests had no time limits here). It was really funny watching GR search around for his car keys, one time throwing them up on the roof so he had to get a ride home. Towards the last couple of months in my senior year i started going all out. food fights in the cafeteria, and casually taking the air of the basketballs the school gymnasium, boy was it fun but i was only getting warmed up. Everything was going smoothly, and 9 times out of 10 they never found out it was me, so i was practically in the clear. Theyre was one kid in the school who was infamous for sucking up to the staff, and telling on all the other students, we can wall him bitch boy or BB for short. GR recently got promoted to head of the facility, and from there shit went downstream. I got called into the main office one morning after someone had written racist slurs all over the walls by the school lockers. Rarely getting into trouble for anything, i thought it was nothing and id soon be back to class. However in the office i saw clara my social worker GR, a campus security officer, and BB. I inquired why they called me in and i got straight to the point. they told me BB came forward with a complaint of me drawing obscene slurs in the halls outside where everyone could see. I instantly fired back saying i had no part in this. They said regardless they have to treat it as they would any other incident like this. I asked them where is there proof as they have no cameras, and it was just bb saying it was me, it was my word vs his. Given the fact the BB was GR's pet the school sided with him.  I ended up getting escorted out and being confined to my dorm for a week with a resource officer present 24/7 for a \"safety concern\". what a fucking load of horse shit, that lying bastard. After the week was over GR called me in for another meeting detailing how the incident was discussed among the administration, and how this jeopardized my diploma. I proceeded to scream at GR saying \"are you fucking kidding me? I worked for a year your school branded labor camp, for you to tell me my degree is forfeit?\" He looked at me with a crooked smile, and said \"Yes that's exactly what i'm telling you. After the meeting i had nothing more to lose, even if i was going to finish the year the year without a degree. They would remember fucking with me for years to come. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the year i was there i spent most of my free time in the computer lab learning how to use javascipt, C++ any other coding language i could with the time i had. I really enjoyed tech and testing the loopholes in security systems, as the school filtered all the internet traffic on campus. This often got my computer privileges taken away but the amount i knew by now was more than enough for the task at hand. The Last Saturday before graduation i spent most of the day in the computer lab working on a virus to penetrate the schools secure network. It took 4 hours of coding and 2 hours of testing before i had my finished product. All i had to do was load it into a flash drive and drop the payload during the graduation ceremony. The day came for all of us to graduate and for those who's parents came go home with them. Of course my parents came, and i bitched to them about how everything went, and they said don't worry this is your last day anyway. I said fine, and thought to myself \"sit back and watch the show\" As i dropped the package into the school network around 20 minutes before the graduation started it gave the virus time to infect all the computers on the schools network. I had basically copied someones code for a pretty simple ransomware virus, give or take editing out most of the text and replacing it with sensitive information belonging to some of the other staff in the present room. To be able to make the program self install on all computers in the school server. I Plugged the flashdrive into GR's personal laptop prior to entering the auditorium. The virus has a packet dedicated to grabbing the administrator credentials, of whatever computer its entered on, guess who's computer it was? They Ceremony went on as normal until halfway thought when the computer they were using to project pictures over the year suddenly shut off. The teachers got caught up in a pandemonium, while GR took the mic and said it was a slight technical glitch they were attempting the fix the continue the ceremony as normal. They rebooted the computer and right when it turned on GR's face turned bright red. The text on the screen read as follows, \"To unlock these computers, please pay 100 dollars per unit the following address\". The kicker was that the email listed was none other than the personal email of GR. Following this a huge commotion ensued, parents started shouting how could the school do such a thing, and teachers proceeded to leave. Most of them resigned soon after as they thought there former boss was the mastermind of the schools most recent cyber-holocaust. My parents got up, and said were leaving. I got to go home and enjoy the rest of the night of my ps3, (oh how i missed you). The following morning we received a call from the school apologizing for what had occurred the night before, that GR was fired, and criminal action would be brought against him. The only reason i could think why by smiling is because i put the flashdrive in \"his\" computer, so \"his\" credentials were used for the payloads delivery. What sweet payback this was given the fact that technology is what brought the man down that stole technology in the first place. Karma's a bitch ain't it!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward 8 years i'm 24 now and i just remembered this story, since i saw an ad for the school on tv. Don't ask me why, but ever since that incident the school went bankrupt almost 4 times. As for what happened to GR &amp; BB. Well for starters it turned out bitch boy was the once who painted the racial slurs to seek attention, for that he ended up being stuck there til he graduated and got sent to a mental ward a year later, crazy kid. GR however was sentenced to 5 years in prison for damage to the schools computer network, which cost almost 300,000 to buy new equipment. He lost his wife, his house, and his career. I'd say good enough for me. I'm now graduated college with a finance and a kid on the way. sometimes life is a little fucked up, and it takes doing something fucked up to remedy the situation.",

            "selftext": " \n\nOnce again many years ago when I started work in IT. (\\~1992) I had started working after getting an opportunity from the IT manager where I worked. Computers were just a hobby and I was actually to start with in a clerical job. IT was definitely the go and I am still in IT now.\n\nWhen my first salary/performance review came around, I had my meeting with the project director. He was an ok guy but the company was loathe to pay people more if they could avoid it. So my review went something like: \"You're doing a great job but your knowledge is primarily hacker knowledge and you don't have any certifications. So we really can't promote you or give you a big raise\". In '92 calling someone a hacker was a bit insulting in a professional environment.\n\nSo I went out on my own, studied and wrote exams and got Netware certified (yes, I am really that old). So I was ready for the next time that the review rolled around. As he was coming up with the traditional excuses about raises to which I pointed out \"Oh, I went and got myself Novell certified.\" The response was \"We didn't ask you to do that.\" I was a bit pissed at this point.\n\n2 weeks later, we were playing company softball. And he was pitching. In those days during batting practice, I could hit a ball so hard repeatedly that it was elliptical afterwards and not really a sphere. Not in a million years could have I done what happened next on purpose (I'm absolutely not that good). But I hit a line drive which hit him in the wrist. His Omega wristwatch, exploded into pieces. He was in a wrist brace for months afterwards.\n\nHe never called me a hacker again after that.... a few months later, the project moved to Nova Scotia, I went with it along with a promotion and a great career in IT began.",

            "selftext": "I\u2019m new here but something happened recently that made me laugh.\n\nFor a little context, my ex, who I will call Jessie (of course, not her real name but let\u2019s go with it) and I dated her, two times. The first one was when a friend of mine claimed she cheated on me which at first, I believed but then I was led to believe that she didn\u2019t cheat on me but I was too uncomfortable to date her again for a while, the second is the story I\u2019m going to tell right now.\n\nSo, I was at camp and before I left, I liked her and she liked me. It wasn\u2019t till I was at camp was when I started to date her as I thought she liked me back. Of course, I was wrong. So two days after camp, I could tell Jessie didn\u2019t like me that much since I got that vibe that she didn\u2019t. It was only proven worst when I saw her make comments about a guy\u2019s ass and hugging a girl like how she hugged me on the beach, which I thought she was good friends with her and I thought she was joking. \n\nLater on the bay, Jessie and I were watching two teams do a tug a war, I asked her who she thought would win and she claimed the right side, she was right and proceed to ask me for $20. Which confused me but I was cool with it. To explain as well, I didn\u2019t say a team.\n\nLater, I was walking through the boardwalk with her on the beach and in a store, I made a joke about wanting water because I was dehydrated (which, in a way was true since I have been in the beach and been dehydrated a bit). After I made the joke, she proceeded to claim I needed to hand her $30 for the water, I asked why and she was like \u201cIf you love me then you would give me $30\u201d which brought a weird feeling in my stomach (instincts).\n\nAfter the beach, she claimed that her mom found out about our relationship and she was forced to end it but she said \u201cbest friends?\u201d Which I agreed but the back of my head, I was mad and I wanted revenge. \n\nSo for the revenge, I met her again and she was like \u201c$30 please\u201d. In response, I said, with the most rude way, \u201cYou ain\u2019t getting shit\u201d. She looked at me for a split second with her jaw hanging down before she started to no longer be interesting in me. Being the emotional guy I am, I felt bad and even cried until nighttime since I don\u2019t like being a jerk or feel like I did anything wrong.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until a girl that was in the same room as Jessie, who I will call \u2018Messanger\u2019 (you\u2019ll know why), basically told me in the hot tub at camp that she was flirting with the girls in her dorm and made comments about the other girls, saying \u201cI love you\u201d behind my back. She even claimed that she LOVED drama and lived with it. \n\nAfter Messanger left, I thought for a while and felt better but then I realized that she attempted to scam me out of my money and most likely, try break up for me afterwards, I laughed at the whole situation. I guess my emotions really do come in good use.",

            "selftext": "Alright, so here\u2019s my first Reddit post here.\nScroll down for a TL;DR.\n\nBackstory: My father and stepmother (who I wouldn\u2019t even call my stepmom anymore) got married about 2 years ago, which ended pretty early. This was when I was about 12. We were about as middle class as you could get.  We had a nice house and everything, until people from my stepmother\u2019s side started ruining everything. Substance abuse was a factor; she basically got my dad into doing drugs. When CYS found out, he lost custody of me and my brother, so we were to stay at my mothers for the time being. 2 years of not seeing my father, and court hearings left and right as a 12 year old kid did put a burden on me, as I had to live in my mother and stepfather\u2019s lifestyle that I was not used to. We\u2019ve had some scary occurrences where my stepmother would threaten my mother that she would come over to her house and take us. This is from what I remember as a child.\n\nNow, at this point in this backstory, I had no idea what was going on. I was told by my now-father\u2019s-girlfriend of what she knew from everything. After everything died down for a while, my stepmom would pull the \u201cleave-and-take-everything\u201d card, to which she was planning to spend all of his money with my uncle, aunt, and a bunch of others in my family. They planned this out by setting up my father. Their plan was to fuck with him, and it worked. He was arrested for simple assault, but he was shortly bailed out. While he was in jail, my stepmom would then slowly drain away his money, and slander his name to my family. When he was bailed out of jail by father\u2019s sister (not the aunt who was planning this with my stepmom), he found out and basically broke down. His kids were gone, no one in his family believed him except his mother and his sister.  Until, my father\u2019s girlfriend met him and fixed his world. My dad wanted to get rid of my stepmoms life in his, so he finally settled a divorce. But, this story doesn\u2019t end here yet.\n\nRevenge time: When I was 13, I had a best friend (and still do to this very day) who\u2019s brother dated my stepmother who also experienced the same thing. Just for that, I was extremely pissed off.  When I found out some of my family was involved with setting my father up, just took me over. When we had a family reunion, of course, the stepmother wasn\u2019t there, because she was a scared little bitch. But, take a guess who else was there. The people who sided with her, and set up my dad. I couldn\u2019t handle my emotions and told the rest of my family what truly happened, what a lie these people are, and how they don\u2019t deserve to be apart of our family anymore. The rest of my family disowned them, leaving them to rot by their own selves.  Soon enough, my stepmother was thrown into jail for identify theft, and what not, after these occurrences happened twice, to which they were reported to local law enforcement. \n\nBut wait, we can\u2019t end here just yet. Just weeks after mentioning her being in jail, I forgot I still had my ex-stepmother\u2019s PayPal and credit card on my Xbox account. After my dad was arrested, my stepmother went on a spree of selling my Xbox collection of games, toys (including mine and my sister\u2019s), our clothes, everything, and some of our family\u2019s possessions. So, since that reminded me of what she did to our stuff, you can guess what I did with the 2 years of Xbox Live Gold gifted to my best friend and I, a whole year of a Game Pass subscription, and a bunch of games for me to enjoy for all that shit we went through. And the best of it all? My father is back to his original self, with a girl who loves him the most.\n\n\nTL;DR:\nEx-stepmom ruins my fathers life, steals all of his money, goes on a spending spree with some of my family, gets thrown in jail, people who set my father up get disowned and thrown out of our family, and I get to go on a spending spree from the ex-stepmoms PayPal.",

            "selftext": "A little backstory: When I was 21 I met this girl which I thought was really fun to hang out with. I started to catch feelings for her and I asked her if she wanted to be my girlfriend. She said yes. We were a couple for 3 years when I decided I wanted to marry her so I proposed to her in the middle of a date. We stayed engaged for 1 year then we had our wedding with all our families. We had also met another married couple which I thought were my friends. They had 2 children one was 3 and one was 4.\n\nI found out some rumors going on that my wife was cheating on me with the husband of the married couple. When I heard this I broke down but I was going to look for evidence before I confronted her. I looked on her phone at his number and they had 0 texts which was odd as we used my wife's phone to text them (to hang out). I looked on the his wife's phone number and there it was lots of texts. Shaming me and saying they want to move in together. Also on how they were fucking in my bed when I was at work. I was heartbroken. I told my friends and told them not to tell anyone because I had a plan. I took my wife's phone deleted all the messages and slept on the couch.\n\nWhen I woke up:\n\nWife: Why are you sleeping on the couch?\n\nMe: I was getting uncomfortable on the bed so I came to the couch.\n\nWife: Oh okay. (She walks away)\n\nNow I need to tell you something about my wife that I will now refer to as EX-Wife for the events that happen next. She goes to work and I stay home from work today saying that I am 'sick'. I had saved all texts on my phone and remembered the married couple were heavy drug users. I will now call the Husband Dave and the Wife Daisy (Fake names of course).\n\n(On call with dave)\n\nMe: Hey Dave I am going to come over. You got weed?\n\nDave: Yeah man come over. Im kind of high already.\n\nMe: You already smoked some?\n\nDave: Yeah I just wanted to loosen up. (Great my plan is going into action)\n\nMe: Okay I am coming over.\n\nI rarely smoked weed but he was too high to realise. When my Wife came home she saw police outside Dave's house (I called the cops on him).\n\nEX-Wife: Why are there cops outside Dave's house?\n\n(My chance)\n\nMe: Why have you been fucking Dave in my bed?\n\nEX-Wife: \\*Silent\\*\n\nMe: Tell me.\n\nEX-Wife: We were drunk it only happened once I promise.\n\n(I pull out multiple screenshots of text messages which were shaming me also saying they fucked in my bed everday on work)\n\nMe: So what is this then?\n\nEX-Wife:You went through my phone!\n\nMe: Well you cheated on me.\n\n(We had a big argument)\n\nMe: I don't care leave my house!\n\nEX-Wife: What?\n\nMe: LEAVE!\n\nEX-Wife: I have no where to go..\n\nMe: Go to your parents house. I do not want a whore in my house!\n\nEX-Wife:Bu-\n\nMe: GO!\n\n(Wife leaves the house)\n\nI break down. I cried all night. Next morning, I saw Daisy in the garden (she looked like she had been crying) so I went up to her. She didn't know Dave was cheating on her. My plan was going into action very quickly.\n\nDaisy: Dave was arrested yesterday....\n\nMe: Yeah I know.\n\nDaisy: Why though? Why?\n\nMe: I did it.\n\nDaisy: What?\n\nMe: I have something to show you. (I run back into my house get the screenshots and get back out)\n\nDaisy: \\*Silent\\*\n\nMe: He was cheating on you with my wife.\n\nWhat I didn't plan for is that she actually liked me more than a friend. I did also when I threw my EX- Wife out. Daisy and me actually moved in together and Dave was arrested for 4 years. 4 years later Dave was released and I laughed so much when I heard what happened. Dave did not know me and Daisy are now married. Oh and if your wondering what happened to the kids. Well lets just say they are now better and with us. \n\nThis is a conversation Dave had with Daisy.\n\nDave: Hey.\n\nDaisy: Hey..\n\nDave: Can I move back in?\n\nDaisy: No. I do not live there anymore..\n\nDave: What?\n\nDaisy: I live with AloneLychee now.\n\nDave: WHY? Are you cheating on me? Just because I went to prison?\n\nDaisy: We are married. I am not cheating on you because you cheated on ME.\n\n(Dave ends the call) (This is entirely based on memory.)\n\nI found out later through friends that Dave had tried to go to my EX-Wife but she told him to go away and that he ruined her life. Its funny that she now feels bad and she even tried to tell me to come over and have sex with her. I blocked her number.",

            "selftext": "About 8 years ago I was a manager of a small English school in an Asian country. Part of my job included hiring foreign teachers. Claire, the teacher submitted to me and approved by the school owners for hire, is from the US. A middle aged woman who had never lived abroad and was quite proud of her one expedition down to Cabos San Lucas that in her opinion made her a veteran traveler. \n\nI didn't bother bringing up the 10 or so other countries I have visited up to that point. \n\nNearly immediately Claire had demands.. I knew from the get go she was going to be a high maintenance sort of employee. To be clear, when I was a manager, if you were high maintenance and a good worker, I would tolerate your annoying shit.\n\nClaire had no teaching experience. \n\nShe had no teaching experience, her degree was in some sort of liberal arts, and her work history looked like she was found of expressing her opinions loudly and too often at work. Lots of 6 months to a 1 year sort of positions all over it. Retail, dining services.. things like that.\n\nThe school needed the teacher, the owner thought she looked cute and would be easy to market, and I was told to make Claire happy and get her to the school..\n\nUnless of course I could find a suitable replacement...\n\nI didn't have anything in particular for a replacement.. which believe me.. I looked. \n\nThen one day, someone popped up on a major Teach english overseas forum that in its day was a virtual center for all things ESL/tefl. Now its a bit of a ghost town of recruiters and bad site design. jesus Dave, get an update in will you?\n\nThis someone, to be called Sarah, popped up and started a thread about her manager. I could put enough pieces together to realize that her manager worked at a school owned by my company. The company I worked for at the time owned 80 or so schools all over the country I was living in. As with all similar such postings, I private messaged the OP, and asked if I could help them navigate the waters of the company. The company had a national and regional offices staffed with native and foreign workers whose job was to grow the brand and try to help distressed foreign teachers who were having problems with their bosses.\n\nSarah, lovely lass by the way, responded and gave me some more details. A few messages later and I realized I was talking to someone who works at a school with a foreign manager I had did a training with. \n\nThis same foreign manager pulled his balls out and stuck them in my glass of beer when I went to the toilet. \n\nRevenge became the order of the day.\n\nSarah added me on facebook.. I confirmed with the school she'd do as a replacement for Claire. \n\nI rewrote Claires resume, Jack the foreign manager whose balls visited my expensive glass of imported German beer, had a reputation of being picky about the teachers he hired. \n\nI didn't change the places claire worked at, I just cut out 2/3rds of them and extended the time frame she worked at the remaining places.\n\nI then contacted the national office and asked about helping Sarah get a transfer to my school when her six month contract ended. Before then Jack had threatened to have Sarah blacklisted with the company as he was having trouble finding teachers and didn't want her going anyway. He also showed her his balls as well one night when they were out drinking. \n\nAt least he didn't stick them in her beer. \n\nOr her mouth.\n\nAnyhow..\n\nKeep in mind, all the while Claire is getting more and more demanding, wanted this and that..\n\nThe timing of the event was critical.. Claire had her ticket purchased, which I told her not to do until her letter of invitation was issued by the provincial government. She ignored me.\n\nDropped a bunch of money on a ticket.\n\nAt this time it wasn't as difficult to get a tourist visa converted to a working visa, now its nearly impossible. \n\nSo it sort of went like this..\n\nJack got a call from a regional director saying that Sarah wanted to move to my school.\n\nJack freaked out but calmed down as soon as he was told about Claire and forwarded Claire's resume.\n\nThe timing was tight but if Jack moved today, he could get Claire on the plane and her visa changed from a tourist visa to a working visa with a quick visa run to a neighboring country.. \n\nJack agreed, I told Claire we were full, but this other school wanted her and they were willing to agree to her \"requests\". I mean wtf a single person needed with a 3 bedroom apartment to herself was beyond me. That was one of the many demands.. \n\nSo many..\n\nWanted assistance with travel when arriving in the country, by that she meant she needed to be met at the airport and helped onto her connecting flight. The airport being a day away by train for whatever poor bastard who got sent to spend 20 minutes helping her get her ass on another plane.\n\nShe wanted new flooring installed as she didn't want tile floors, but carpet, which is highly unusual in the country I was in at the time.\n\nYadaa, yadaa, yadaa... bite me Claire.\n\nAnyway.. Sarah gets her transfer.. Claire gets sent to this other school... a couple weeks later I get a call from Jack raging about what a demanding cunt Claire is and how incompetent she is. \n\nMy response, \"hey Jack, Sarah is doing great and you remember the time when you stuck your balls in my beer?\"\n\nand then I hung up. \n\nThe regional manager got involved later on but there really wasn't much he could do as I had screen shots of him advising me to forge people's university diplomas so we could get them work visas. \n\nAbout 6 months later, I saw a post on the forum I mentioned earlier, so many broken promises and how her boss was a creep who like showing his balls to people when he was drunk.. etc.. It was a glorious multipage whinge fest about all the terrible things that happened to her. \n\nMost of which seemed pretty routine to me, I mean going abroad to live and work in a foreign country means you are going to see things and have to do things that make no sense to you. \n\nAh well, good times.\n\nobviously names were changed and all that.",

            "selftext": "This story starts out around my freshman year of high school, and I had started dating my ex. I quickly found out that she was an AWFUL person, she did things like 22 year old guys, lying about being suicidal, and just generally being an attention whore. We dated and broke up, and dated and broke up. The biggest dealbreaker was the \u201cFaking the suicidal stuff\u201d. That put me over. Nearing the mid-end of the school year she got together with one of my best friends. I remember telling him \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the kind of person that makes you choose relationships but (Ex\u2019s Name) is kind of a bitch and will make you do that.\u201d He took the warning and kinda did nothing with it. But I noticed changes, bad ones at that; he wasn\u2019t talking to people he usually would on a daily basis, and he was barley talking to me. I pressured him on and he got very upset. I knew EXACTLY what was going on. I knew she was stringing him along and controlling him. I got fairly upset and sent her some angry texts. Me and her argued for a couple days. Then after the weekend finished off I quickly caught wind of her saying \u201cI\u2019m gonna beat the pulp out of OP.\u201d I figured she was just empty threating me. At lunch she kind of got up and approached me. This is where it all when to shit. She punched me, HARD, so I did the only logical possibility when she turned around I, as John Wick would have done, stabbed her in her lower right back with a pencil. A fucking pencil. I broke on impact. We kinda grabbed/dragged each other into the hallway next to the principles office where a teacher broke it up while I grabbed her shirt a punched her before being restrained. 3 or 4 days before school was out. So I ended up with a case worker for the rest of the summer.\nI also got some harassment from her which upset me to say the least. But there was nothing I could do otherwise I would go to jail for battery, assault, and disorderly conduct.\n\nTL;DR Don\u2019t fuck with me if I\u2019m within 10 feet of a pencil (or in general).",

            "selftext": "I was bullied relentlessly from the 3rd to 7th grade by multiple people in my class or upper grades. After I graduated 8th grade I received a Facebook message from Andy, a boy who had been bullying and harassing me from the very beginning of it all. I would post the exact message, but it was extremely vulgar and long. He ended it by saying that since we would never see each other again he could put it all out in the open about how much of an idiotic, ugly, and loser I was. Of course, he used a more colorful dictionary with those words but you get the idea.\n\nHowever, there was one problem; my parents' owned a large wood chipper. Andy's father owned a tree cutting business and would often rent it from them for the much larger jobs. During the Summer I noticed him walk in and start talking to my uncle, and I realized the golden opportunity I had been given. I loaded Facebook on my laptop and bring the message up. I then approach his dad and tell him \"Your son sent this message to me a few days after graduating, and I think its really important you read it.\" He raised an eyebrow at first but took my laptop. As he read, I could visibly see his face turn blood red and his hands shook as he gripped the sides of my laptop harder and harder.  I think he re-read the entire thing over again just to make sure what he was reading, and even clicked the profile to make sure it had indeed been his son who sent it. Finally, he gave me my computer back and told me he was so sorry for his son's behavior and language, and that he would most certainly be dealing with Andy the moment he got home.\n\nIt took 2 months for me to hear back about the fallout. Andy's older (and way nicer) brother Grant was friends with my sister, who told her and then she told me. Andy was grounded for the entire Summer, Fall, and Winter break, his parent's canceled the trip he was going to take to the beach with their student youth group at church, canceled his summer camp trip,  going to hold him back from getting his Driving permit for a full year, took away all his games and computer, instead of going with his dad and brother on their hunting trips he would be sent to his grandparents' house to help clean, his social media passwords were changed so he didn't have access to them, delete his Xbox account,  and Andy would have to work for his dad doing tree cutting the entire summer and winter holiday (there were more punishments but I honestly cannot recall them). I ruined his life for a good 2-3 years, and destroyed the relationship he had with his father and mother (probably not forever, but they certainly no longer saw him as their well-behaved youngest child). It was so satisfying.",

To the story now. So I was at an airsoft fiend a while back and had another bad encounter with an entitled young man who\u2019s favorite words had to be give me.  Because that\u2019s all he\u2019d say before taking what he wanted without waiting for an answer. So through the day this guy had used my whole bottle of 6000 bbs in his LMG luckily I had another one that I didn\u2019t let him see. He\u2019d also used the last of my green gas that I didn\u2019t say he could use and 2 canisters of my co2 that was STILL IN MY GEAR BAG. At the end of the day I always bring a 6 pack of Henry wienhard root bear for the boys and there wer five of us so we\u2019d have one left. Time for revenge so I left one root beer on the table and my friends go pro near it facing above the root beer on a magazine and snot took the bait // if you\u2019ve ever had root beer you know how fizzy something like a&amp;w is or maybe mug but Henry is on a different level if you nock it back even a little I promise you\u2019ll need a rinse bigger than the one your nose just got. sure enough this grown ass little snot took our soda without asking and nocked it back so hard that his whole head went back and the result was absolutely beautiful. he snorted choked gagged the bottle hit the floor and he tripped on it we all got back just in time to see him sputter and trip over himself trying to get up still slightly shocked from what happened. And we all belly laughed at this little snot with root gear all over his face all over the geound with fizz lines going from his nose to his chin. It was a disgustingly beautiful sight. And the ultra had video was even better. Plus the owner made him mop the whole staging area and when we told him wat happens he gave me a bottle of bbs a can of green gas and a pack of co2 as a compensation/ reward for our trials and efforts and gave my friends free paches.",

We are super close like we hang out all the time both at work and outside of work.\n\n\nI'm very affectionate and touchy feely. Her boyfriend also works with us and he hates me because he thinks I'm trying to take his gf. I'll admit I purposely make him mad cus when he comes around i'll grab her ass or touch her vagina right in front of him. He gets so mad everytime and calls me disrespectful. She sometimes tells me to stop because it makes him mad but I truly dgaf about him or his feelings towards me.\n\n\nSo yesterday I was messing around with her and he got mad so we got into it. I called him a \"pussy bitch\" and he threatened that he was gonna get his sister to beat my ass. I didnt wanna look like a punk in front of the girl I like or the rest of my coworkers, so I was like \"bring her idgaf\" Truth is I can't fight at all and she would probably beat my ass. All the girl I like did was laugh at us and told him to relax. So I went on twitter and his sister was saying she was going to whoop my ass and talking all types of shit. When I told my crush about this all she said was that if we fight, she can't do anything about it and that it's between us.\n\n\nI'm so mad and hurt now and also a little worried about the sister.",

            "selftext": "I dont know if this should go on r/prorevenge, so give me some advice but not too rude. Since i was 5 i had this diary saying think happy thoughts and a few 400 pages long. I loved it, but my siblings thought it was some stupid ass book i \"never cared about\".  When i was little they used to write prank letters in there. This time it went too far. About a week ago, i was close to finishing the diary. Today i woke up with a bad modd. Couldnt find the hot glue gun, got mad and... yah. Then I burnt my finger horribly using it and then got in a fight with my 16 yr old sister who does tkd and i didnt hurt her. In the evening i went on a walk around our neihborhood and when i got home my bro and sis were sitting in my room laughing and reading my diary. \n\nBro: \"Aww, you like Flynn?\" (starts reading my love note) \nMe:\"Dude wth, and that was in first grade!\"\nBro:\"I really like you Flynn... haha\" \nME: \"GET OUT!\"\nI smack him and grab my diary. AT THAT MOMENT I BROKE OUT IN TEARS. \nMy book was destroyed. Destroyed. The papers were falling out and the cover was ripped off. I punched him and slapped him (which did no damage cuz hes a 2 degree black belt) and ran away with the book.\n\n\"Such a family!\" I yelled  nd then i cried in the padio for about an hour. When i got  back home to drink some waterBro and Sis were gone to tkd with my mom. I ran into my room and put a chair under the knob so it cant open and then started writing this. By the time i got to such a familly my dad banged on the door. \n\nDAD: \"(my name) open the door! \"\nMe still crying: \"leave me alone\"\n\nthis kept going to him almost breaking the door and getting in yelling at me to go play wit my fucking sister (whos 2)\n\nI grab the computer running into the bathroom. I need help for revenge on my brother who ripped my diary. He has this big book where he draws his anime guys and really likes it. Give me some ideas on how i could get a smidge of revenge so he understands that he shouldnt mess with me.",

            "selftext": "There\u2019s a lot of time skips, I\u2019m sorry in advance. \nP (ex 17)\nMe (me 17)\nPM(Exes mom 36)\n\nSo I\u2019ll start this off with a backstory. I was dating this girl P for about 2 years and throughout the entire thing it was a toxic relationship, and she cheated many times. Of course me being dumb. As it\u2019s my practically my first girlfriend and real connection. Emphasis on the real. So I was blindly love. Fastfoward to around may or June of 2018. I was at P\u2019s House, in the kitchen. PM then asks P to go do something. As soon as she leaves she forces herself onto me, something I didn\u2019t want, and was never consenting to. (This fucked me up, I barely told my parents about this) p\nComes back and I don\u2019t say anything, I don\u2019t tell her and I\u2019m just off for the rest of the day. I\u2019m dumbfounded and I truly had no words for it. The following September. P cheats on me and has a relationship with this person. All while behind my back, I found out, we broke up, and oh surprise surprise. December 2018 I take her back and we start talking again. Eventually get together and was together until this year, May 2019, I find out she was cheating AGAIN. And not only had already done physical things with one. She had another guy waiting on her, on tinder. That night I told her I was done, she fucked up. But of course she played the sob story. How she felt I didn\u2019t care and that\u2019s the only thing that made her feel better. Also. She had sex with the guy that P cheated on me with, after they broke up, mind you, this woman, PM, has a husband of 15+ years. \n\n\nNow for the revenge. after this night I had fallen completely out of love with her and had 0 interest in her anymore. But I stayed with her for a tiny bit, just for her to feel that things are getting better and maybe that we\u2019d be good. I knew she had my passwords for one of my things and I cheated and let her find out, just to break her heart to get her to feel what I felt. Now TODAY. I find out that HER MOM exposed things that were private to me to get back at me I assume for her daughter? Well, that\u2019s not okay with me, that\u2019s private. So, I contacted her husband. Told him everything she has done. I exposed P to her family about how she is. as far as I know. PM and P are dealing with domestic violence against PM. I wanna press charges to make it worse but I may have already caused enough for both of them. I have screenshots and evidence. That she didn\u2019t feel for me in a way that I did for her, I saw PM as a friend and treated her as such. But I did what I did. Ruining the connection I had with her family and her. But oh well. A small price to pay for salvation. \n\nTL;DR: exes mom exposed private pictures of me that I had sent to my ex. I expose ex to her family about her true character. And exposed her mom to her husband.",

            "selftext": "Sorry on mobile (lol)\n\nFor names sake, the scammer will be named scambag.\n\nI always loved to play save the world in fortnite, I started playing In December of 2017. My brother gave me 50 bucks for Christmas and I bought stw with it. I also got a phone which will become important later. All I did was play stw and I would almost never play battle royale.In December of 2018 I\u2019m playing stw and scambag that he will give me half he\u2019s inventory for all mine, [he had really good and rare guns] I trade with him and scambag kicked me from the game, so I lost all my guns and items, making it impossible for me to play the game. I was so angry and damn near depressed at the time. Months go by and all I did was collect the daily rewards for battle royale and the skin you get from having stw. One night I realized that I could use twitter to reach scambag, which I do.  He denies it, but I already knew because he [like a retard] posted all of the stuff he got from scamming people. I get him to give my guns back, but I\u2019ve already got my plan started.\n\nThe REVENGE: I become his friend for a week or two when I get to know HIS friends, I wait and then tell his friends. They are all pissed. Apparently, at school he was always known as the nice kid but was always rude to his friends. This was the breaking point for them.  They tell me that sometimes he would hit them and sometime beat them up. They never left because scambag knew that one of their mothers was abusive and the others never left to support the one with the abusive mother scambag would bring this to isolate him from everyone else. Then they say something groundbreaking. Apparently scambag raped someone. I bring this all to the local police. Scambag had no idea what was happening. The next week scambag day \u201cfriend\u201d told me scambag got arrested and kicked out of school. Next year I learn scambag was sentenced to 20~  years With a bail of 95,000! \n\nGood revenge for a bad person.",

            "selftext": "So this story started last year when I was about to begin my  high school year and I had a pretty good time meeting new people and talking with old ones. When I met my classmates, they were pretty nice and would often introduce me to new people (considering I made friends pretty easily because im really social). When I talked to this one kid, who we'll call Tim, I thought he was pretty normal as with my other classmates. He soon became my friend and he joined me and my friends discord group and would often be active. \n\nThings were pretty normal around school and around home. Me and my friends would often talk online and play games such as minecraft, Overwatch, CSGO, and more games. \n\nSoon, Tim started to ask favors such as borrowing $10 and promising to give it back but wouldn't. He  also tried to steal my phone, and even tried to snatch my homework in an effort to copy it. I often caught him in the act but teachers wouldn't do anything even if I showed them evidence. He even started to steal stuff from my FRIENDS too. One of my closest friends who we'll call Jacob caught Tim in the act of stealing his laptop. \n\nNow the revenge..\n\nWe soon had enough and took matters into our own hands. We recorded every single time Tim tried to steal, showed it to our class during a presentation, and he was toast. Everybody in the class began to scold him and our teacher gave us an B+ on the presentation saying that he will be REPEATING FRESHMAN YEAR! This news carried on to the newcomers from 8th grade as I heard from one of my friends in 8th grade. I aslo heard that he got expelled from all school activities and will be suspended for the first 2 weeks of school. We also heard from his parents that he will be getting all of his video games away as well as his consles. \n\nNEVER screw with me and my friends.\n\nTL;DR: Kid tries to steal me and my friennds stuff. Gets a massive K.O blown to him by embaressing him in front of a whole class.",

            "selftext": "So, about 2 weeks ago I found a small sub called /r/occult it was just a bunch of people with loads of interesting little beliefs on how the world works. I thought I'd ask a question, specifically why they'd worship the devil if they believed he actually existed. My logic being that the devil is typically a bad dude, so you wouldn't want to meet him at the pub really would you? \n\nAnyway, around that time I'm messaged by someone with a username that starts with Fart, so I'll call him Fart from now on. Fart sent me a creepy video that was \"cursed\" I laughed and sent him on his way. However, he was insistent and claimed that I was a member of some sort of Occult Illuminati esque organization and one which he would reveal to the world! I laughed it off and ignored him.\n\n\nIt's been two weeks and [every post or comment I make](https://i.imgur.com/jG9TmbU.png) has him respond to it with some variation of \"This guy is stalker, watch out!\" ironic ofcourse, since he's stalking me. \n\nThankfully some kind redditors have told me that he's been doing this to them as well and revealed that he has an alt, begins with Gloom so if you see a Gloom or a Fart pop up in the comments, you've found him. \n\nAnyway, he's been at it ever since and still is. A few hours ago he sent me a private message, reaffirming his desire to bring me to justice! So, I had enough. I sent him a picture of a hand doing that weird circle thing, It's meant to be a meme or a joke, surely it annoyed him. But I had a greater purpose. I'd used a link shortener on the image which logged the IP Address of whoever clicks it and various tidbits of info therein. I was still considering what to do with this when he commented on a post I made in /r/creepy that featured an image of some of his comments using one of his alts. This mere minutes ago. I decided to send the same image to his alt and for some reason, he clicked it. An idiot he is. Now I have the log of both IP's along with real world locations. I won't reveal it here because I'm not a bastard. Suffice to say, they're the same. So I've proven that he as an alt.\n\nWhat now you though? Well, firstly I've reported every comment he made to the mods of each subreddit and as of 5 minutes ago I reported him directly to Reddit Admins with proof of his alts and IP address conveniently included.\n\nWhat's left though? Well, turns out the IP Logger led me to some extra information about the individual, nothing I'll share but the most important is the direct email of his Internet provider, specifically the abuse department. I understand that this isn't EXACTLY what they deal with, but I'm sure an email with his IP, time of abuse and location sent to the people that control his internet would be at the least, worrying for him.\n\nI think the most entertaining part of this for me is that he's reading this right now, might even pop into the comments for us all to enjoy. Anyway, Fart/Gloom, Let's not meet again.",

This continued for 2 years till other orphans got suspicious and started making fun of the girl (let's call her maria) Maria got depressed and tried to kill her self .

            "selftext": "So this only happened a few weeks ago. I didn\u2019t know if it would fit in r/treelaw or here.\n\nI have a huge maple tree that is about 120 years old, this is very important to the story.\n\nSo this happened as I said about 2 weeks ago. I moved into my new house on the countryside with a pretty whacky neighbor who said \u201cit\u2019s nice to meet you sir\u201d I said hi and he asked if I wanted to come over to his house so I could get to know him better. I politely said no because I had plans that evening. He took this very harshly and looked like he was about to strike. Now I\u2019m a 6\u20193\u201d Male and he was maybe 5\u20196\u201d. So instead of us having to call the police I just told him goodnight and shut the door. \n\nA few days later I got another knock on my door and it was him JN (Jerk Neighbor), he had a smug look and said \u201cSo the previous owner of this house said that he hated the huge tree in his backyard and I hate it to, will you get rid of it?\u201d I said \u201cNo, I love this tree and it\u2019s over 100 years old, I\u2019m sure the owner loved it to.\u201d JN \u201cWell if you don\u2019t get rid of that tree then I\u2019ll burn it down myself!\u201d He walked away grumbling so I shut the door and contemplated.\n\nI have never had a neighbor this harsh and wondered if all people in this area are this weird. So a few days after this interaction with him I got back home from work and saw that the tree, the main reason I bought this house, was nowhere. I found a large hole where they had completely taken it out. I. WAS. FURIOUS. Never had I seen an act of vandalism as bad as this. I stormed over to his house and demanded that my neighbor explain what happened. He was smiling ear to ear.\nJN: The tree was on my property and I don\u2019t think it belongs here.\nMe: It was clearly on my property, you even said it yourself that the owner didn\u2019t like HIS tree not yours.\nJN: Well now it\u2019s gone and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it!\nHe slammed the door in my face. As soon as I got home I called my lawyer and asked what I should do about this and he said to call a Tree Lawyer. So I called and he came over and was bewildered when I told him it was a 120 year old maple. I took him out to where it was and he stood there mouth gaping (he hadn\u2019t dealt with cases like this before. He told me the tree would be worth about $135,000. I went over and asked him what company took the tree down. He naively told me so I asked them and they told me the tree had been on his property and they immediately apologized so I thanked them for their time and left.\n\nWe took him to court a week later. It went on for a while and it was going In our favor and then we won. He didn\u2019t pay or have the tree put back for a month. By that time payment for the tree had doubled. Another 2 months went by and so did the rising price of being payed back. It was now over $500,000. I then called the police and explained to them what was happening. He was taken back to court and had to pay by tomorrow or he would go to prison. He finally payed and I then put up a wooden fence on the property line, I painted a big middle finger and right next to it wrote SCREW OFF. And TREE KILLER. I got lots of comments on it by friends and family. He never recovered from the law suit and he came to my door begging for money a while later saying they would sell his house and he had no money left. I scoffed and shut the door.\n\nI heard a while after that he had become a homeless drug addict and was arrested for MURDERING someone. He was sentenced to 25 years and I haven\u2019t seen him since. The revenge was spray painting my fence because he had big time investors come to his house and see the fence and they asked about it. Which is what got him so short on money.\n\nMoral of the story: Don\u2019t screw with a 120 year old Maple and piss off the owner or else your bank account, house, and you will get FREAKING JACKED UP.\n\nHave a nice day Reddit I hope you enjoyed this tale of absolute destruction to an overconfident man.",

            "selftext": "**Trigger Warning!**  \n\n\nOkie dokie, so for part of high school, I lived in a super duper ultra small town in California. If you're familiar with the area, just saying 5x8 mile island where peanut butter was invented should tell you exactly the town. Since it's super small though, I'll abstain.   \n\n\nI had lived in a bunch of other places, from big cities to tiny villages in third world countries by the time I started my Junior Year in this town. Also this story takes place about 13-14 years ago, so my memory might be a teensy bit foggy. I've got the important stuff though.   \n\n\nMy point is, I was a bit more cultured than the average of my class and not a known taker of shit.   \n\n\nOn this island there were these three guys who we'll call Nick. That's not their real name. It's just another generic name that all three of them happened to share. They weren't particularly good students. They were on the lower end of the economic spectrum, but their parents had been on the island forever.   \n\n\nAll three of them were those super fun Eminem-types without any of the talent. All three were notorious for hooking up with girls without consent. All three were well known for being abusive to the women they dated.   \n\n\nTo differentiate, I'll say there was Fat-Nick, Boof-Nick, and My-Nick, because yeah I was one of the lucky girls who dated a Nick.   \n\n\nFat-Nick was dating a good friend of mine. He beat her, cheated on her, roofied her, and then assaulted her. At one point, his abuse was so bad she developed an eating disorder and ended up in rehab after almost dying.   \n\n\nBoof-Nick dated another good friend. He eventually ended up in jail for *other* reasons, but he got hit by our revenge too. We called him Boof because he was way into drugs I'd never even heard of and frankly still don't entirely understand. He used to beat on my friend. He tried to force himself on her, thankfully she's a giant and fended him off. But he was the reason she didn't date until her 30s.   \n\n\nMy-Nick was .... oh boy. Started off ok, but he broke my nose and then sodomized me when I was 16.   \n\n\nI admit I didn't believe my friends when they tried to warn me. It wasn't until it happened to me that I lost my shit.   \n\n\nAfter that happened, initially I was broken. I mean, coming back from that is harsh. Tried to kill myself twice. Got pretty close. We stayed dating. I just couldn't leave. I tried about 9 times. To this day, if I'm walking down the street and I hear a loud clicking sound, I go in full panic mode and my husband has to take me somewhere else. Every time I broke things off with him, he'd find me. I didn't have a car, so he'd drive by where I was walking yelling at me to get in.   \n\n\nUnlike my friends, my beautiful wonderful wholesome innocent friends, I have an attitude. My pride will kill me one day. No matter how terrified I *felt* I never got in the car. Still, we'd get back together.   \n\n\nIt took about two years before the revenge actually happened. By then, all three of us girlies were about to be safely on our way to other cities and states for college.   \n\n\nThe friend who had dated Boof had pictures, but the police said it had been too long for any of that to matter. The friend who dated Fat-Nick was the kicker. Boof and My might have taken drugs, but Fatty was the dealer.   \n\n\nWe planned a party at Fat's house. My buddy had reached back out to her ex about reconciling and it was her birthday. What better way to celebrate rekindling the romance? Boof and his now-ex weren't on speaking terms, so she came with me and My-Nick.   \n\n\nAt this point, we were all 18 at least. Not able to drink, that's for sure. Fat's Girl and I put the moves on our respective men. Boof was doing boof-things and pawing stupidly at a freshman in a corner. We got them all very drunk. Then we started with the \"babe, I've never tried this. Will you try it with me?\" for E, which there was called \"thizz.\"   \n\n\nBoof was high elsewhere. Fat and My took some, thinking they were going to get us high and sneak us off into another room. Another friend actually overheard them talking about swapping with each other once we were too high to notice. But because they were so full of themselves, they never saw that we didn't actually take anything. We just acted like we did.   \n\n\nAbout twenty or so minutes later, we gave them the whole \"we're gonna go freshen up. We'll meet you in the bedroom\" deal. Peeps of reddit, the reason that's so common in like every dumb high school movie is because teenagers are idiots and it works. Over and over, always. Idk how I dated someone that dumb for that long.   \n\n\nWhatever. We slid into the bathroom with Boof's ex and then crawled out of the window. We then each called the police. One of us complained about the noise. One of us mentioned children drinking. And I told them someone had a gun they were threatening people with. That was true, actually. Fatty had his dad's gun and whenever his \"girlfriend\" didn't want to make out, he would take it out, stuff it in her mouth, take the safety off, and then he'd laugh when she started crying.   \n\n\nI cannot stress enough what fucking monstrous trash these boys were.   \n\n\nThe police came. We were down the block when they did. Fat's parents bailed him out, but he lost his scholarship to Chico State and ended up going to the local JC. Boof was in jail (not prison) for 4 months, then he was released on parole which he violated. My-Nick was found jerking off in a bedroom with his pants around his ankles looking like the moron he is when the police actually got there. His brother knew the police, so he was out pretty fast. I wasn't done with him though. He was pretty mad that I'd left him at the party. I was just a little more angry than he was though.   \n\n\nI'll wrap up the other two boys before I get into that.   \n\n\nFatty's Lady is married with two kids now, the guy is really awesome. Fatty himself died 7 years after this went down from, I believe, a heart murmur.   \n\n\nMy friend that dated Boof went to art school and she makes super cute custom cosplays that she sells on Etsy. Seems to be doing great, by her IG posts. Boof oooh man... He took to the local bars pretty heavily. At one point, he was at a bar talking to some really old (gay) man. Apparently Boof didn't realize the guy was gay and was hitting on him. The old man invited Boof to his apartment after the bar closed. From what I've heard, he attempted to initiate something with Boof. Drunkenly, Boof beat the guy to death. That happened four years after the fact. He got out at one point, then did something with arson charges. He's been in prison since.   \n\n\nMy-Nick. His revenge didn't see any massive nuclear things. His brother got him out of jail. His brother was a thug type who bred blue-nose pitbulls for fighting, but he wanted better for his baby brother. He genuinely though that I would be the one to get his brother out of that town and set him straight. Because he thought his brother was doing so well, he was financially supporting Nick. And Big-Brother was understandably worried when he discovered we'd broken up for good because I was leaving for college.   \n\n\nBig Brother arranged a meetup with me to beg on his brother's behalf. From there, I showed him countless pictures of every time Nick touched me in an unkind way. The cops might not have cared, but Big Brother knew I was a sweet girl and he knew Nick could get bad when he was high. I also had videos on my phone of Nick drinking (underage), getting high, and throwing cash that his brother gave him onto tables for gambling and then losing, then calling his brother for more with some sob-story about how he was mugged or left his wallet somewhere. Always some bs, Big Brother always believed it. Right up until he saw proof.   \n\n\nHe cut Nick off after that. Nick showed up at my dorm two cities over a few months later with flowers and jewelry, saying he knew he messed up and I was The One. My RA came out with me and pretended to be my boyfriend. Nick started calling me a whore and making a big scene in the courtyard. Police were called again. These actually seemed to give a shit.   \n\n\nThey took him away. I didn't hear from him again until after I left the state. Kept tabs on him for a while, just to make sure he was still miserable.   \n\n\nHe got a job with the city working with kids at a local park. My mom was ready with a complaint about seeing him open-carrying around 6 years olds. He lost his job with no idea as to who did it. He started dating a literal hooker and renting her out to his friends for cash. He's still in that town, slowly getting gentrified into homelessness. Still with that girl. Still thinks he's going to be a rapper. Generally just seems like he's biding time until he dies. He's got a record, thanks to me. No one in that town wants to hire him.   \n\n\nOnly a matter of time. I'm ok with this.",

            "selftext": "Hello people of reddit!\n\nThis is my first post sooooo take it with a grain of salt.\n\nSo I went to a high school which had a bilingual chemistry class. Back then I was really serious about learning. So in this year we had 18 classes per week of english, 5 german classes and the rest were like 2 math 1 hungarian literature so basically only langauge.\n\nWe had 5 types of english\nGrammar\nRegular English\nWriting\nSpeaking\nPreparations for the language exam\n\nThis is where the story starts.\nI was 14 at the time. First day: we get to meet our teachers one by one. PREP class comes and we meet our teacher. She is kind of condescending but everyone has his/her flaws. She asks us to write an essay on ourselves as an introduction.\n\nOn the next day her class comes (we had it once a day) and she mocks some of students and talks down on us. She is not yelling or anything, she just talks down on us.\n\nAs the days fly by we learn the material and get our first test. It was hard af. Nobody get above 70%. A few got ~60%. She was hardcore about grammar.\nYou couldn't use abbreviations, or American spelling. She would of course talk sh*t about our class after the test. She would belittle others in class and what not. She was a bad teacher was always ranting about something, ignoring other's problems. She would randomly grade test without reading through them. When we asked words most of the time she wouldn't knew them. Also one day she claimed that the word \"eggplant\" is not real.\n\nIn our school we have a thing called \"Project Competition\" for bilingual students. First years have to compete. Now what is this competition? It is a powerpoint presentation afternoon, in english.\nThis was created so students would get used to public speaking. This was a big project for us. We would write 7 minute speeches with slides and everything. I was competitive and wanted to win, even tough it was just a participation thing. I have massively f*cked it up due to my anxiety. This was in march.\n\nMay goes by and I want to take an advanced langauge exam. I try to speak to the Prep teacher about it after class, because she was the one who should have prepared us. I ask her what should I do or how. She says I have to wait until I graduate and if I tried I'd fail. Thanks for nothing I guess.\n\nThe next class she mocks me in front of the class. Now this may not look that bad, but due to my anxiety I was devastated. I was straight A student and I wanted improve and getting shut down like that was depressing.\n\nSo the summer goes by and I make a goal to take the advanced langauge exam (C1) this year. I bought a book for this exam it was  ~10$  and started learning the topics. They were really hard because as a 15 year old wrapping my mind around euthanasia and politics was a bit much. Fortunately my other teachers were helpful and kind. They would do arguments with me and generally they poured hope into me. As the teachers know I would do the exam in December of that year, but I failed to register in time, so I have to go in January. Prep teacher mocks me again because of it etc. Fortunately my classmates are great and they helped me a lot too.\n\nIt is Jan 5th the day of my exam. My big brother comes along with me for encouragment. I go in after 45 min I come out. I thaught It was over. As the days come and go we finally get the results. I passed. I put it on my Facebook so everyone can see. A ton of relatives gratulate, even my form teacher is impressed. Next day on my first lesson the P.E. teacher shakes my hand and congratulate me. \n\nMy PE teacher and Me are not friends so she couldn't have seen it there. The news spread in the morning. In a day everyone knew in my school. It helped me with my anxiety a lot.\n\nFor three months the Prep teacher wouldn't say a word to me. She wouldn't greet in me in the hall or even acknowledge me sometimes. \n\nAround April we were in Prep teacher's class. She was on a rant about english in general and how today nobody can speak English the way it is supposed to be...\nShe turns to me and says\nPrep teacher: \"It does not matter if you have a langauge exam paper that does not mean you can speak English\"\nAs you can imagine I got furious. However I put the biggest smug grin on my face and said\nMe: \"Yeah, same with teaching.\"\nMy biggest mic drop moment, the entire class is silent. The bell rings after, what felt like an eternity, and she leaves. \n\nAt the end of the year I had only As and a C from langauge prep. My mother is pissed and goes to the  principal. We learn the many students have reported her due to different reasons.\n\nReading this back this is not as crazy as some others  in this sub reddit but I hope someone who is shy and introverted or someone with a mental illnes can relate. I hope you got some good vibes out of my story. Have a nice day fellow people of reddit!",

            "selftext": "  \n  Reading Pro Revenge is my schadenfreude pleasure when I have downtime at work. I usually read just the front-page, but lately lots of frontpage stuff has been linking to Pro Revenge, and I realize that I have something of a revenge story in my life too.   \n\n\n  This all took place five years ago in the beginning.   \n\n\n  I've lived my whole life in Russia except for the four and a half years I lived in the Eastern part of the United States, where I went to college for a degree in engineering after completing my one year of national service. There are lots of good schools here but I originally had the intention of moving to America permanently. I have relatives who live in North America so I was invited to stay with them during this time. It turned out I didn't really stay with any of them.   \n\n\n  Because I am tall and good at sport I also did high jump and basketball while in school. I was never that good, but adequate enough to make the team to such a degree that I was retroactively  earned small athletic subsidies while already enrolled. It made my tuition slightly cheaper, which for an international student was a concern, even if my parents were high status regarding money.   \n\n\n  While enrolled in college I met my soon to be girlfriend Natalia, a girl originally from Connecticut and from a very wealthy family. Her major was fine arts and we met in an English class and began dating. Natalia was a little more than two years ahead of me in her studies age-wise but we became a serious enough couple to where I took an apartment toutside of campus, and she moved in with me. Her parents' house wasn't far from campus but she chose to stay in my apartment, mostly because I don't think she wanted to bring me to her house too often. Maybe her parents didn't approve of me, or maybe she did not approve of me enough to show me to her parents very much.   \n\n\n  We had a good relationship or at least I thought it was good. She never complained and always liked to show off that we are a couple. She was the first person I knew in my circles who owned a selfie-stick and she would take it with us and everything was a photo opportunity. I didn't have any social media at the time but I made one just so that she could \"tag\" me in her posts. Eventually all her social media friends added me as a friend also. And since many people from my own home country had social media too they saw me and added me as well.   \n\n\n  Among Natalia's friend group people called me Drago which is dumb because I don't think I look like Ivan Drago. Natalia makes no secret to me of the fact that she is from a wealthy family and she tells me that she has a trust fund that will pay for her lifestyle her whole life and she doesn't even really need to attend college.   \n\n\n  I'm from a privileged background too but I don't have a trust fund myself. My father owns a small hotel outright, and where we come from that means you're rich like Steve Jobs in a relative sense. So sometimes in the mail, Natalia would get these bank statements that just tell her how much money she has in her trust fund, how much interest it made, and what her dividend, or in other words her allowance, for the month is. It is for this reason that Natalia is in no particular hurry to finish school, which is why at the time she was already twenty-three but only barely a sophomore. Natalia would show these statements to me and leave them lying around the house.   \n\n\n  They didn't have her whole bank account number listed on them anyway. They just showed balances and the name of her bank. My parents and my athletics paid for a good amount of my expenses but I still worked on campus at the bookstore to earn more money. Natalia didn't work.   \n\n\n  I didn't really have many issues with Natalia. She seemed friendly enough, was pretty, and good company. We had lots of things to talk about and we had fun together, or at least I had fun and thought she had fun too. I didn't know if I ever wanted to marry her, but I didn't rule out the idea. One thing I didn't like about her was that she was very dramatic and very prone to panic. For example if we were at a department store where she wants to buy a particular thing, and her favorite personal shopper isn't available she'll act like it's the end of the world. She wasn't above making scenes. She'd also be a bit short and rude with restaurant staff.   \n\n\n  One thing that I thought was a bit disingenous of her was that although she was a millionaire, she liked to pretend to be poor. Not that there's anything wrong with not flashing your wealth, because there isn't. What I mean is that she'd try to act like she came up rough and that she was making life happen on her own, if I make sense. She tried to act like she was down for the cause as some say. It's kind of like when rich suburban kids try too hard to copy how things happen in a hip hop video. Except Natalia wasn't trying to be White female Tupac, she tried to do this Bohemian artist thing and pretend to some people that she was living on a shoestring.   \n\n\n  Around me, she was more herself. Or really I don't know which self is her real self. All I know is that she isn't poor but she pretends to be, in certain company.   \n\n\n  Well moving on.   \n\n\n  Eventually Natalia tells me, OP what do you think of having an open relationship? I didn't really know anything about open relationships but when Natalia explained what they were, I told her I wasn't interested in anything like that. I asked her if she wanted to be in one and is that why she's asking, but she said no, that she just read something about open relationships.     \n\n\n  From my now-perspective I know she probably had someone or some people in mind who she wanted to date or have sex with, or she already had been doing these things with one or more people but just hasn't told me about it yet.   \n\n\n  Natalia had had her inner reproductive organs surgically cut so that she could not have children. I bring this up, because SHE brought it up to me, when she was practically begging me to have unprotected sex with her, and I was worried about maybe getting her pregnant when she didn't want to be. She showed me the actualy paperwork for the procedure by emailing me a PDF document that she received from her own doctor.   \n\n\n  I only thought about it after the whole open relationship discussion because up until then we had been having sex without a condom and I assumed I was her only partner and I knew for a fact I was clean, but now I was worried whether or not SHE was actually clean.     \n\n\n  But for a couple weeks more things appeared going as normal. She assured me over and over again that she had no other partners, and so like a fool I continued to have unprotected sex with her.   \n\n\n  Suddenly though within the month, Natalia tells me she needs to move out, that our relationship isn't working out.   \n \n\n Okay, I think, I'm sad to see you go, but can we be friends? And her attitude is yeah of course we can be friends! Even then I knew she probably met someone new or had always been with that person and was now just ready to move on from me. My attitude is well most girls come and go, that's life. I'm sure many women have the same approach to guys.   \n\n\n  She left a lot of her stuff behind like clothes and papers including her bank statements that had her trust fund into on them. I tell her since we're friends why don't you come by and get your stuff? Or I'll bring it all to you. She said oh that's fine I'll get them someday could you please hold them for me? And it's not as though she had that many things at my apartment. I think she especially didn't want to have me bring it to her house or new place where she stayed because she had a new boyfriend. None of my business.   \n\n\n  I never linked my social media to my phone or went to computers to check it because I just didn't care about that sort of thing and I still don't. But I found out later that Natalia had deleted and blocked me on social media almost immediately after she moved out, and combed through her friends and deleted anyone who appeared to be one of my friends from back home.   \n\n\n  I was almost done with my degree and over the next year completely lost touch with Natalia, though I never argued with her or had an official falling out. I assumed we just moved on with our lives. I had been accepted at another school one state away from my undergraduate college to complete a masters degree, and didn't want to waste time, so I hired a service to box up some of the less important things at my house and forward them to my new apartment. By this time I had bought a used car and so with one suitcase I could set myself up for a few days while I waited for the bulk of my furniture and other luggage. I sent a text to Natalia and emailed her too, telling her where I was moving.   \n\n\n  In my new hometown I jumped headfirst right into studying, and hardly even went home except to eat and sleep. I never even opened a few of my boxes that contained things I wouldn't need, like old textbooks or very heavy winter clothing. Those stayed in their moving boxes.   \n\n\n  So after another year, I have my masters, and move back to Russia. I'm happy because I had managed to get a job right away in my chosen profession. I sell most of my random furniture on the internet. I had written down what was in each moving box, on the outside of the box. Those boxes that contained nothing I needed right away were kept sealed the entire time I was in my second American apartment.     \n\n\n  When I arrived in my current home, I finally opened all of my boxes and realized that I still had some of Natalia's old clothes from when we were a couple, two and a half, three years ago. I even still had her old trust fund statements. I had over a years' worth of them, which is about the length of time Natalia lived with me.   \n\n\n  Since it had been such a long time and we hadn't talked in years, I assumed she no longer wanted the things, but I still didn't want to give them away or throw them away without seeing what she had to say.   \n\n\n  So for the first time in years I check my social media, and am surprised to see that she blocked me from sending her messages. I try to text her but her number has changed or maybe she blocked me there, too. Anyway she doesn't reply. Same thing happens when I email her. Why will she block me? I wonder. I think it must be an internet problem. I log out and just try looking at her social media as a random web user, and have no problem at all.   \n\n\n  I see that she hasn't really changed. Still pretty, still dressing all quirky and Bohemian. I feel kind of weird but I take a little break from what I'm doing and just see what she's been up to for the last couple of years. She's with some new guy now who looks a little bit like me but with longer hair and less responsible haha. Well good for her.   \n\n\n  I can see that she really puts her whole life out there on social media. Every little thing is worth an update from her. She is as dramatic as ever. I do notice she's a lot more political than she was before. Well that's good. It's always nice to believe in something passionately. I am not at all surprised to see that as usual she portrays herself as a struggling artist who's making a way for herself in the big bad city. Whatever works for you, Natalia, work it! She talks trash about high fashion brands, how she never had anything growing up, how she ate stew from grass as a child because she was so poor. She is really laying it on thick, and also she ripped off that story from ME, because I was telling her about how my relatives were forced to eat grass stew during the patriotic war because there wasn't much other food.   \n\n\n  All of this is just her being a poseur, which doesn't affect me, but what does affect me is when I see a post that mentioned me by name. \"Nat, this is SO like your abusive ex OP, OMG!\"   \n\n\n  Her friend was refering to a picture of how verbal abuse is just as damaging as physical abuse. Natalia had replied, \n\n\"yeah, OP really tried to destroy my self esteem. He was also not shy about threatening me.\"   \n\n\n  Lots of guys who were her friends on social media commented that they'd kill me or kick my ass if they ever saw me. For most of them I would laugh because I would smash them like so many ants but right now I am furious because Natalia lied about me. Some of them were even seriously talking about naming me to school administrators about having my degree canceled or having me put on some kind of offender list.   \n\n\n  None of them bothered to keep in contact with me so they didn't know I moved back to Russia, but they were also talking about reporting me to the police and having me arrested.   \n\n\n  In other posts Natalia also mention me by name and actually accuse me of assaulting her in various ways, that I cheated through school, that my parents are in the Russian mob (LOL oh-kaaaaay).   \n\n\n  By a little digging I saw that she broke up with the guy who I figured out was the man she moved onto after me, and he was getting slammed, too, and I'll assume he was also blocked on social media. From piecing together what Natalia says to her friends on social media, it's clear she's built up an image of being a struggling artist, and her current boyfriend also appears to believe she's a struggling artist, and they share an apartment together. I piece it together that the boyfriend works a 9 to 5 but he looks like a hipster type so maybe he is an artist too. He looks like he's struggling to keep it all together. They are totally into the activist scene. They're always talking about onling funding for all kinds of charitable work. Noble stuff. Not being sarcastic.   \n\n\nNatalia smears me across platforms. The book of many faces, the grams that are instant, the stupid blue bird app where people unknowingly brag about how worthless their existences are.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  Right away I think of the bank statements I have that show Natalia is anything but struggling. Because according to the statements I have, unless Natalia developed a $10,000 a day coke habit over the past two years and bought a Bentley and crashed it into Taylor Swift and lost a court case, she's getting just over six figures a year just sitting on her ass and will continue to earn these funds in perpetuity.   \n\n\n  But then I think, I've moved on and am happy, I don't even know Natalia anymore, I don't REALLY care what these social media losers think of me...   \n\n\n  Until I see yet another post where Natalia makes this dramatic statement about how she is unable to have babies as a result of a traumatic assault. To her credit, she didn't blame ME for this imaginary attack, but she was still trying to score social points by pretending to be a victim.   \n\n\n  I was even more convinced when she and her friends actually altered some of the pics of me online that Natalia had once taken with her selfie stick, and X'ed out my face using photoshop paint. The photos were captioned with all kinds of untrue slurs. Really harsh, criminal accusations. Funny, how all of them are so eager to accuse me of being a criminal and are talking about how they will kick my ass if they see me, but none of them think of telling the police about any supposed crimes I committed.   \n\n\n  Seems really lazy.   \n\n\n  I thought about somehow faking an account and getting her to add me as a friend, but then while looking through her friend list (and she had like a thousand friends), I saw that one of my friends was still on there. My friend doesn't speak any English and he doesn't spend much time on social media either, so he had no idea what any of these people were even saying.   \n\n\n  I noticed even long ago that it was weird that Natalia didn't include her own parents on her \"friends\" list, but she explained that away by saying they were too old and didn't do technology. Maybe, Natalia, but chill, your parents are like 52. I suspect now (even then, I suspected it) it's because she wanted to build up a different persona online, and her rich parents would ruin that image.   \n\n\n  Through lots of digging, I figure out where Natalia works. It's a non profit.     \n\n\n  I finally decide to return Natalia's things.   \n\n\n  I put her old clothes, many of them really expensive designer shoes and purses) into  box with her bank statements, and address them to her non-profit. I don't actually write Natalia's name on the outside.   \n\n\n  I write her name on the inside, explaining that these items are all things that she bought while she lived with me when I was still in the USA.   \n\n\n  I figure they could raise many thousands of dollars if they sell these things on Ebay. It would be great for their non profit.   \n\n\n  A couple of days later...   \n\n\n  As for Natalia's actual bank statements, I collected some of her greatest hits online where she posted pictures of herself at rallies bemoaning the 1%, complaining about her hard knock life, about how much she cared for others' suffering. And I combined these photos on a photo editor with her bank statements, with red highlighter around her monthly allowance, how much she had in total, and how the funds would last forever. I also made sure to highlight the name of the originator of the trust, a quite well known name in American industry who is identified as her great grandfather.   \n\n\n  For each of the twelve statements, I add one of Natalia's hypocritical posts about being poor, struggling, living check to check, how she depends on her art to survive.   \n \n\n My favorite post is where I screen cap her post about how she is unable to have children due to an attack. I merge this with my PDF she sent me where she paid over $10,000 to have her tubes wrecked. I made sure to highlight her parents' state and zip code, though I crossed off their exact address.   \n\n\n  I made my point though, that the procedure, which took place a few years ago, was when she still lived with her parents in one of the most titanically expensive locations on planet Earth.   \n\n\n  My Russian friend and I spent the next fun hours spamming the walls of all Natalia's friends with these pictures that show she is rich and a liar. All of them he had access to, anyway, and it was well over three hundred. We make sure to fire similar, battleship broadsides to her over-filtered and photoshopped account where she's always thinking she has to lie to kick it, and also send her and all her friends lots of bird calls on that other app.  \n\n\nThe fallout was hilarious.\n\nThe denials sad and pathetic, but mostly hilarious too.\n\nCredibility? \n\nOh that credibility!\n\nOh, Natalia, it's destroyed.\n\nWhy is your boyfriend so mad at you?\n\nDid all the organizations you've \"liked\" on social media \"like\" it when they saw you were sitting on a fortune and yet claiming \"I don't have any money, starving artist LOL! But can I offer my time or homemade brownies teehee?\"  \n\n\nDay one: Friend count: 1,234, Subscribers, 2,740, Followers, 1,080\n\nA week later: Friend count: 620, Subscrbers, 895, Followers, 466\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend doesn't speak English, but he and I are waiting to see if he'll be the last one eventually.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonths after that...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  I was curious to see later if she was online anymore. POOF! Her profiles were gone or at least the ones she had been using for years. I hope her boyfriend enjoyed his sudden comeup! It was probably an amazing day at the office for him to come home and learn that his Bohemian hipster girlfriend was sitting on millions of dollars.   \n\n\n  To this day I have no real idea why Natalia would do this to me to begin with. I was always nice to her and never even raised my voice to her. I can't remember even one occasion where we actually argued. It's a mystery.   \n\n\n  What isn't a mystery, is, the fact that the non profit actually called me long distance to thank me for the box, and they made sure Natalia got it. I didn't try to make any secret that these items came from me, so if Natalia wants to sue me for finishing a war she started, she can go right ahead.  \n\n\nI asked if she still worked there and if I could talk to her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh no, sorry they tell me, Natalia moved back home with her parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMust be nice, having such a luxurious, eight bedroom fallback trench.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  Live by the sword Natalia?   \n\n\n  Enjoy getting IMPALED on it.   \n\n\n  I hope you enjoy finally getting your stuff back. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom Russia,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith Love.",

About a week later when the kid got off at my grandpa's bus stop and started trying to attack him, my grandpa grabs the kid by the scruff of his neck and slammed his head into a stop sign.

One day, one of the drivers was in my trailer/office bugging me. I told him to leave. His response: \u201cOr what?\u201d I warned him not to go there, or I would have to do something. He asked what. I told him that I had no idea, but I would think of something. He continued to annoy me, laughing at me and telling me that I could not do anything to him. Challenge accepted.\n\nShortly after he left, I made a plan. I proceeded to then movie trailer and found the perfect movie cover. I scanned it, then did some pro-quality photoshopping, placing his face on the picture, as well as changing some of the text.\u00a0 I then printed off multiple copies and put them up around the camp. The response was epic!\u00a0 The movie box now read: Phil Pepper is Forest Gump! Complete with the title character sitting on a park bench facing away from the camera, but Phil\u2019s face towards the camera, making him look like his head was twisted around backwards. \n\nI posted several copies around the camp, and by the end of the first day, most of them were missing. I though perhaps he did it, but he had not seen them yet. It turned out that he annoyed a lot of people and they loved the poster, stealing it for their camp.\u00a0 I got several requests, and he came to me begging me to get them back. I just laughed and told him that I had warned him. The poster ended up in almost every camp in Bosnia, and circulated back to Canada, and he never crossed me again!",

            "selftext": "So recently, a week ago, I found out my girlfriend was cheating on me with another guy and was a Druggy beyond believe, lets meet the case  \n\n\nOp: i wonder who that could be... CG: cheating girlfriend. AB: Asshole Boyfriend, BM: Best mate  \n\n\nIt was About 4 - 5 months ago I met CG, at first she seemed like a real nice lady, she was pretty hot, only a bit chubby, yet not the brightest... but 2/3 is not that bad, but as time went on, we talked to each other online due to long distance relationships, and she started to talk to me less and less. I kept asking her why she's not talking to me as often, every, single, time, her response was \"Sorry but I was busy with friends\" It seemed innocent enough, I asked one of her friends about her, they said they had not seen her in weeks, i ask the next, and the next, and the next, none of them had seen or heard CG, until a faithful night last week where someone spilled the beans, in comes AB  \n\n\nCG: (not aware i was hiding in the chat) Everyone, I know how much you're all worried about me, and I love you all, But i love AB specially, so i need to spend more time with him  \n\n\nI was shocked, absolutely disgusted how she just openly admitted she was cheating on me with a bunch of her friends, I left the chat quickly before i got caught, I thought maybe there was more behind the scenes.  \n\n\nThere sure was, but not the way i was expecting  \n\n\nthe next day, i wake up from a message from BM, saying that CB had been up all night smoking weed and doing lines, I checked for myself and lo and behold, there she was, getting that good snow in her nose while AB was behind her.  \n\n\nI was even more mad, but also upset, the woman i loved, turned into a cheating druggy, but that upset turned into livid when i got a text from her later that day  \n\n\nCG: Hey hun, mind if I borrow a few bucks to help pay rent? My paycheck didn't come yet  \n\n\nMe: Yeah sure, how much do you need?  \n\n\nCG: \u00a3130  \n\n\nMy jaw hit the floor, no way i was paying that much, wasn't even going to, that was insane  \n\n\nMe: Oh yeah, sure, let me check my bank account  \n\n\nEven though i didn't have any intention to paying her, I still checked my bank account to make sure nothing was fishy, but this fishing rod got a bite, i checked my account and i was missing \u00a375, this b#### had taken my money to buy herself drugs, i was not having it, time to get revenge  \n\n\nMe: ah sorry, but i didn't get any money either  \n\n\nCG: what?! you're lying! you have money! give it to me!  \n\n\nMe: And how do you know that?  \n\n\nShe went silent and disappeared, i was not having it, this is where the revenge gets real  \nI share screenshots of what she did to EVERYBODY, and they all flipped out, but one person caught me showing them, AB  \n\n\nabusive boyfriend started tearing down everything and even deleted my number from as many group chats as they had, but luckily i had BM show me what he was doing  \n\n\nAB: dont listen to them CG, nobody cares about you except me, you only need to listen to me, right? dont give a second thought to them  \n\n\nCG: OP is just jealous of you, he was poor anyway, couldn't even afford a bag worth, I say we diss on him, make him feel worse about losing a rich model like me  \n\n\nBM: drugs are bad, you know? you can't just push everyone away that says your habits are bad  \n\n\nCG kicked BM, but luckily what she was doing was pretty open enough for me to see, she was blackmailing me to other people, saying i wished for her to die and overdose on the drugs, calling me stingy for not sharing money and even said i had temper problems when i kept telling her that what she was doing was wrong.  \n\n\nI screenshotted every little detail of these blackmails and our conversations, we made a little blackmail of our own but she wasn't having it, so we forwarded it to the police. we closed our laptops and just waited.  \n\n\nthe next day came and it was like f###ing christmas, i go see BM and everything was crumbling, CG had been arrested for a boatload of drugs, stealing, tax fraud, possession of illegal weapons and blackmail, AB got arrested for drugs, tax fraud, abuse, rape and assaulting police officers. both cursing my name as they were both put in the back of the police vehicle, I slept well that night and me and BM had a good laugh.  \n\n\nTo this day, i keep finding more pics of CG and AB shittalking my name online before they got arrested, which makes me laugh even more knowing that karma had caught up to them.",

            "selftext": "This story happened to my late mom and after reading some other prorevenge stories I figured you guys may enjoy this. She lost the battle to cancer last year so telling her stories helps.\n\n TL;DR at bottom\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBackstory: My mom was always a very hard worker. She raised me alone and worked three jobs to make ends meet. Her love in life was taking care of people. \n\nOM: Original Manager, BM: Bitch manager, Mom: My mom, BR: 90yr old bed ridden resident.\n\nMom had been working day shifts in a nursing home for a while and was on good terms with most of the residents and staff. Her evenings and weekends were spent at either an in-home care facility or the local hospital. Her schedule was packed, but balanced. Side note:  She always made time for me and was a wonderful mother.\n\nOne day OM announced he was retiring. Instead of promoting withing he hired someone outside the nursing home and started training her. Enter BM\n\nImmediately BM started acting high and mighty. Talking down to residents. Making idle threats to staff. Just overall being mean. Obviously BM and my mom did not get along. BM noticed very quickly that my mom had way more respect from the staff and residents than she did. Because of this BM made it her personal mission to make my mom's life hell. It started small. Changing the halls she was used to working, asking her to do things outside of her job, making her work during lunch. Just petty shit. Mom did them without complaint because that was just who she was, and she needed the work. \n\nThen one day BM found out about mom's other jobs and how tight her schedule was. BM being a BM decided to change everyone's shifts. Something something less overtime saving money. Mom was put on night shifts. This royally messed up everything in her schedule and meant she would lose a lot of money by not being about to work her other jobs. She went to OM. OM said he would talk to BM about it but the current schedule was made so mom was stuck for two weeks. Mom's new night shift started just as BM was leaving her day shift so they crossed paths in the evenings. BM would always have a smug look on her face. Mom started hatching a plan.\n\nMom was friends with the security guards (more like shamelessly flirted with them but that's a different story). Because of this she saw the monitors for the security cameras and knew several blind spots throughout the nursing home. She would use those spots to have a snack, or unscheduled break to rest her legs. Nothing major. One of the blind spots was the back corner of the break room where some staff cubbies were. Everyone was assigned their own as well as BM. Another point to mention is that one of the residents, BR, always had food  sneaked (snuck?)  in from friends and family that they weren't supposed to have. This gave BR horrible diarrhea. Imagine liquid death topped off with sulfur in a bed pan. It was literally black tar, shit soup that would make an onion cry. All the staff members knew when BR's pan was full because you could smell the poo gas in the hall. \n\nOne day mom came in about 15 mins early and went to chill in the break room. Lots of staff were always coming in and out of there (important later). She went to put her belongings in her cubby and while there quickly snagged BM's car keys out of her cubby. She had to act fast because BM left in a few minutes. Mom clocked in and started her shift. Que mission impossible music. One of the first things she had to do was check to see what hall she was assigned then make a round to check all the residents on said hall. She had BR's hall. When she got to BR's room mom immediately knew BR had eaten something bad again and that the pan was full. After cleaning BR and changing pans mom quickly dropped BM's keys in BR shit soup filled bed pan. Then quickly finished her round and put her cart in the sanitation room for clean up.\n\nMeanwhile BM had noticed her keys were missing and started raising hell. Yanking things out of other cubbies, yelling at staff to find them, and dumping trash cans over. It was a shit storm... lol. She knew someone stole them and made every staff member stop what they were doing so she could question them as a group. This also included the sanitation crew. Everyone was gathered in the main hall for almost an hour being questioned. It wasn't until the residents started to raise a ruckus that BM let everyone go back to work. \n\nAbout 15 minuets after being released the sanitation crew announced over the intercom that they found BM's keys in a used bed pan. Laughter boomed throughout the entire nursing home. BM was so red with anger that it looked like she was going to explode. Sanitation did their best cleaning her keys but no matter what they did the slight aroma of poop death still clung to them.  To top it all off she had a key fob that got to stew for over an hour in poo. Needless to say it didn't work anymore.\n\nSecurity looked over the cameras to see if they could find out who did this but there was to much activity in the break room to pinpoint any one staff person plus they couldn't see BMs cubby in the camera. BM cornered mom because mom had BR's hall and asked her directly but mom just smiled sweetly and said she did't have any earthy idea how her keys ended up in the pan. In the end no one found out who did it.  After the schedule ended mom went back to day shifts and BM did her best to ignore mom. BM made it clear she wasn't going anywhere so A few month's later mom found work at a different nursing home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR My mom dumped her asshole manager's keys in a shit filled bed pan and got away with it.",

They had every right to be mad and I regret my decision to stop helping them. \n\nFirst some context: 1) I am not exactly what you would call a popular person at school. A ton of people know who I am, but they act a bit passive aggressive to me whenever I get into a discussion, 2) I love sports. I am a manager for my schools football team and soccer team, I love basketball, 3) My best friend has devoted almost her entire life to Softball, so we don't spend a ton of time together\n\nAlliases: Me = Me, My best friend = Rachel\n\nSo this started at the beginning of this year (2019), The soccer season started up in February and we got off to a bad start, going 2-4 in our first 6 games. Meanwhile, Rachel plays varsity softball and is so good. She and I were also working on our relationship, (I have feelings for her, but she doesn't feel the same way, so I have been trying to spend more time to see if she starts developing feelings), so I decide one day in March to go to one of her game since she doesn't spend a ton of time outside of Softball, and I loved seeing her play. So I decide to start going to all the home softball games. Problem is that Soccer and softball often happen on the same schedule, so I soon realized that I had to make a choice on which sport. I choose Softball. I left the soccer team, and the team was pissed off. Remember that I said that they were 2-4? Well part of the reason that I left is because I didn't expect a lot more wins through the rest of the season. So a couple of months pass and the Softball team did great, but they never made it to Sectionals. The rest of the year finishes, and what do I find. That the Soccer team actually made it all the way to the State Finals. I realize that I had made a huge mistake and that they wouldn't never let me back, at least not till next year. They won state and I was at least able to celebrate with them. But after that night, whenever I met up with them, they seemed to just shun me from other celebrations. And I understand that. Ever since then, I have been trying to make up with them and it seems to be working\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis revenge doesn't seem pro enough for Pro-Revenge, but I decided to post it just to hopefully get on Youtube. If you see this, Karma Comment Chameleon, please post this. I want people to realize that even the smallest decisions have consequences. Thank you for actually getting this far reader. LOL, TTYL",

            "selftext": "This is my first time here on Reddit, so I'm sorry if things get wonky and outrageously long and i am not a native speaker. Thought it's also nice to post since today's Pride Month. TL;DR AT THE END.\n\n3-4 years ago I met this man I'll call Kevin who's 5 years older than myself, at first he was a snob bitch but as time passed we just became comfortable with each other and boom I just apparently had a crush on him, in which at that time he doesn't know. However he's bisexual and already has a boyfriend. That didn't stop our relationship as best friends, though.\n\nWe go to this Catholic school where LGBTQ+ was looked down upon and almost everyone there was worse than a homophobe so gays need to hide in a closet.\n\nApparently Kevin's a high level dude at this school, an academic aristocrat at its finest, so when the school knew that he's gay, they went WILD. They pretty much bombarded him with questions, hate comments on his Twitter, spread rumors about him being possessed by a demon, yadda yadda. You can already see where this is going.\n\nThere's a big ass group (pfft, fraternity) in this school, and they're wolves in sheep's clothing. Once they knew Kevin was (and is always) gay they, unbeknownst to the teachers and staff, full force just pinned him into the back of the school, with an audience, casually beating him up like he's their punching bag. His face was so rekt you can't even recognize him.\n\nAt that time I can't even move. His other friends were trying to stop these sons of Satan, but I've seen so much bright red that I can't even mutter a word, nor twitch a fucking muscle. I was FUCKING. PISSED. We shared EVERYTHING to each other and y'all gonna beat him up like that just because he likes both p*ssy and sausage? HELL FUCKING NO.\n\nAfter that incident, he was admitted in the hospital for a few weeks or something, I forgot but he had a few neck and arm fractures, a black eye, and an exploded lip. I came home from school fuming and just full force crying on why did I not do anything to stop them.\n\nTwo weeks later and these motherfuckers are bragging on how they beat 17 gays and an aristocrat in a row and \"tHeY M4De tH3M a stR4IghTeR, b3TtEr p3Rs0n aGA1N\" and all that fucking jazz. Fuck no, y'all made them have a fucking trauma for nature's effing sake.\n\nI was full on pissed. I was so enraged. I was beginning to lose hope, overthinking too much that Kevin's gonna die, that the closet kids will be always locked up or something. I can see that too on the other closet kids; one day we just looked at each other in the eyes and automatically knew that we're done with this shit, we have the plan.\n\nWe're gonna fuck everything in the name of anti-homophobia.\n\nI was a goody-two-shoes teachers' pet and also an academic aristocrat of the school, but no one ever knew that I've known a lot of big, buff, ass-kicking people through my cop uncle, watched porn and hentai everyday, curses like a sailor, questions the ever-so contradicting words of the Bible, yadda yadda. In short, those stereotypical \"nerd girls who are also kickass gangsters\" shit, so I basically was a big post for this house of brutal vengeance.\n\nI called the men up, including my cop uncle, and informed that a group of heartless thugs had fucked my crush up really hard and, as a result of some being LGBTQ themselves and their soft spot for my crush, they agreed on the plan. I notified the closet kids about this too and realized that they've already known some precious private info about these kids, their darkest secrets in their private Twitters and some with drug dealer and MLM scam parents. Some of them were friends with the thugs and were feeling a little bit bad on betraying them, but it's for the rainbow, everybody.\n\nA few days later and the house is building up, the potion is brewing and we just see these kids with scars and bumps and bandages wrapped around their bodies. Their eyes were red and swollen and tears were spilling down their face.\n\nI felt bad for them, actually and tried to stop but no, my comrades had enough of the school homophobia.\n\nThe boys beat them up 3 days in a row and a few had been brought up in the hospital with a broken skull.\n\nThe school, finally knowing this one hell of a shitstorm, changed their mind about homosexuality and the now-changed students, after a few rallies, forced the ever-so homophobic principal and some members of the board to get out of their straight thrones and get someone worthy of those positions; took 2 tries but completely worth it.\n\nWe also finally knew that these thugs were actually selling drugs to other kids all this time and were immediately dropped out of the school without receiving the yearly allowance, which, aside from the LSDs and marijuana pockets, were their only source of income.\n\nThey got a 10 year sentence for physical assault, attempted murder, drug dealing and underage selling and their parents got a life sentence for drug dealing, possession, and underage selling. They also will be the one to pay for Kevin's neck surgery and medical bills. Sweet.\n\nSome of the closet kids actually opened up to their parents and after a few explanations and persuasions, surprise, surprise, they accepted them for who they are. They all were (and still) living peacefully now, and we're still good friends, actually.\n\nAs for Kevin, he did not know what kind of shitstorm we unleashed just for him and, gradually, for the school's rainbow justice\u2014the only thing that he knows, until now, is that, everything's fine and he's safe. We're still best friends, though he already knew that I have a crush on him.\n\nNo one may know the masterminds behind that hellish event but, you know, they're living normally now, having their own lives.\n\nTL:DR: Bisexual crush gets beaten by homophobic thugs in school. With the help of other thugs and other queers, they get the Uno reverse card slapped into their face with a prison sentence, tarnished name, no money, dropped out of school and a beating\u2014what started out as a revenge for one turned out to be a good cause for LGBTQs and the school itself.",

            "selftext": "This story unfolded over five+ years, so I will try to keep it short \u2013 obviously leaving out a lot. \n\nMy children\u2019s stepmom, who appeared to be a decent person 15 years ago, became the worst abusing pain pills, snorting xanax, chewing pain patches, calling 911 for being unresponsiveness, and even shooting up with strangers in her own garage.  Stepmom started sharing/doing pot and pain pills with my kids,  then 19 and 16. It was a long struggle, but both kids are no longer involved with drugs now and see her for the POS she was.\n\nAlong the way, my son was in a serious car accident, breaking both legs. My ex-husband was out of town fighting fires in CA, and she shows up at the hospital to be \u2018mom\u2019 (I lived out of state).  Stepmom brings my son pills (hospital has him on pain meds) and she was caught snorting \u2018something\u2019. I talk to the nurses and get her kicked out and banned from his room causing her to start texting and calling saying utmost hateful things... that I was fat, my kids loved her more, she was more awesome than me (she collects disability and I have a career). She even had her best friend texting horrible things *\u201cyour husband is a nasty piece of human garbage just like you, perfect match you\u2019re both ugly as F\\*ck\u201d.* Seems silly, but after years of this crap (every time she got high, she would start trouble) this made me quite angry and my ex-husband was useless to address this. \n\nStepmom\u2019s somewhat destitute father passed away summer of 2015. Suddenly, Stepmom is really doing up drugs with her bestie, going on vacations, buying her own grown son all kinds of gifts (TV, engagement ring, guitar, vacation for 4 to Philippians, furniture) and **none** for MY kids mind you.  \n\nThe moment of pro revenge finally arrived! I figure she\u2019s still collecting her dad\u2019s social security. Turns out she was running up and opening new credit cards in her deceased father\u2019s name \u2013 oddly a crime her brother was in jail for (yeah, trashy family). \n\nI filed reports with the Las Vegas District Attorney and disability fraud reports with the SSA.  After months of silence, a Las Vegas detective contacted me!  He conveyed he couldn\u2019t do much unless there was a victim \u2013 with the father being deceased, that meant that the bank(s) would need to file a criminal complaint. My kids didn\u2019t want to get involved in fear of this woman, but eventually they shared some of the bank names on mail still arriving in deceased father\u2019s name. \n\nStepmom shared a photo of the deceased father\u2019s military headstone on Facebook, and to move the process along, I marched the photo into my local Bank of America &amp; Mellon Bank, explaining my theory.  BofA Fraud department contacted me two days later and after sharing details, which included BofA cancelling the 4 plane tickets to the Philippians trip just days away, desires to prosecute!   Sadly, stepmom used another credit card to purchase last minute tickets at a much higher cost and still went on the trip with her son. :(\n\nStepmom was arrested December 2017 for 3 felony counts and jailed for weeks until court (oddly her best friend was arrested for something else and in the same jail!). Stepmom pleaded guilty in a deal, is on probation with a curfew, drug testing and restitution paid from her disability checks!   While not intended, my revenge probably saved her life as she now is in mandated recovery programs.",

            "selftext": "I don't know if karma qualifies as revenge but this guy got what was coming\n\nWhen I was in 8th grade we went on a 3 day  school trip to Cleveland Ohio. Because the trip cost like 2 to 300$ my closest friends couldn't come and I was assigned a hotel room with 2 random guys, I'm call them (Trevor) and (Bob) .\n\nThe hotel room featured two queen-size beds so I had to share one with Trevor. We took one pillow each and put all other pillows between us because no-homo (and we were 14) when we were back at the hotel Trevor found it necessary to swear at me for hours. When time for bed he found it funny to watch porn on his phone which at first I found kinda funny, remember I was 14 at the time.\n\nBut, when Trevor started to milk his d**k I stopped laughing real quick and told him to stop what he was doing and if he found it necessary to get the fuck away from me and to the bathroom and use his shakeweight there\n\nAfter many swearwords back and forth I somehow managed to get some sleep.\n\nHowever,\nThe second night started like the first only this time Trevor masturbated to completion and showed me the evidence on his hand, I of course cursed at him as did Bob of course although he didn't have to share a bed ( lucky bastard) \nThe third night I was so sick and tired of Trevor after his swearing and wanking that I decided to not take shit from him again so he called me a bitch a few times that evening, he sat down and was still calling names so I took my shot and punched him good right in his eye he called me bitch again so I punch again after that he stood up and we got into a struggle after Bob broke up the fight I had a bloody nose and Trevor a black eye. \n\nAt home I had told my parents what happened on the trip, in detail, zero sugarcoating .\nMy mom wrote an email to school about the situation so I had to go to the vice principal the first day after the trip. I explained the school staff what happened on the trip and after talking to Bob and Trevor they ruled me punching Trevor as self defense (which it was!) But per policy I got three days suspension. I later heard from a friend of mine that Trevor got 10 days suspension and a few years later got expelled from about every school in the county",

            "selftext": " Fake name added for this sub.\n\nAlso, I think this is pretty revenge done professionally, so maybe it belongs here?\n\nPosted previously in Malicious compliance, Military stories, and powerwashing porn, thought ya'll would get a kick outta this too.\n\nAlright... So... One day at Tinker AFB, I get told to go and clean the smoke pit (smoking area) this is unusual, because I am a non-smoker, and it is not a mess to which I contribute in any fashion. Out of the squadron of around a thousand people, I'm one of maybe 50 that don't use any sort of tobacco. No smoking, no dipping, and vaping wasn't allowed back in 2009/10.\n\nThis Master Sergeant, one of the Flight Chiefs comes into the office, and she tells me to go clean it. I'm reading a TO (technical order), because I want to learn my aircraft, I haven't done crap today. And nothing that would warrant me having to do that task. Again, literally not my mess, the 50 of us that didn't smoke never had to clean it. For you non-military people, a Master sergeant is senior Enlisted, been in a MINIMUM of 10-12 years.\n\nI look over to my Sergeant. And just tell him \"Uhm, do you wanna tell them?\" He nods and goes to talk with the Flight Chiefs. He's a non-smoker too, and was a pretty shit-hot dude. He comes back about two minutes later.\n\n\"Ok, come on, let's go clean the smoke pit.\" Well, shit, at least I won't be alone!\n\nNow, me and Staff Sergeant Hobart get out to the smoke pit with brooms and dust pans, and there are weeks of butts piled in and around the cans. Lots of work, would take forever with even the big push brooms we've gotten to do this. I turn to Sergeant H, and sigh resignedly. \"Hey, do we have a pressure washer?\" Sergeant Hobart nods and walks off. I get started sweeping up.\n\nSergeant Hobart comes back with the pressure washer, and we start it up. We take it to the floor of the smoke pit. Immediately a spray of tar brown water shoots up off the ground from the washer. The floor, once a uniform mottled brown to black even coating, is revealed as being pure light grey cement. The color of freshly poured cement! This floor had NEVER been painted. this was YEARS if not decades of tar and smoke we were washing away.\n\nThe one little floor drain in the smoke pit cannot keep up with this. The smoke pit was walled in on two sides, and on the open two sides, you stepped down into it. Tables, ash cans, and some Reagan era posters about the expansion of the USAF are the decor in this gloomy room. We begin to flood the pit because the poor little showerdrain in the floor can't keep up with the volume form the pressure washer. We take it nice and slow now we've learned just how dirty it all is. Pressure washing inch by inch, step by step. The flood of cigarette butts accumulate at the drain and we're scooping them up with the dust pan and depositing them in trash bags.\n\nBy this point, we've emptied the pit of people. After about 30 minutes of this, the Flight Chiefs come out to have a smoke, and they stare at this nasty swamp we've made of the smoke pit, their faces fall, and smokes go back into the pocket. They don't say anything, they just go back inside, defeated that their orders prevented them from grabbing a smoke.\n\nSmokers would have just swept up half assedly and emptied the cans. Non-smokers that got screwed, pressure wash.",

            "selftext": " \n\n* Okay so I have a pretty decent revenge story that happened over the course of about a year. Also, I apologize for the story being all over the place, there\u2019s just a lot to explain to get the full scope of why I absolutely despised this guy. So, without further ado, let\u2019s begin with my boyfriend and I (whom I\u2019ll refer to as boyfriend) moving in with his family. Boyfriend and I went through sort of a rough time and had no other options at the time, so we had to stay at his parent\u2019s house. The first few months we lived there we were broke while we looked for jobs, and were sleeping in the living room. His parents told us that there was an extra room in the house, and that if we cleaned it out, we could have it. This extra room was right next to my bf\u2019s younger brother\u2019s room. For the sake of his privacy, we\u2019ll call him Frank. So, Frank is a complete loser, and I\u2019m not just saying that because I don\u2019t like him. His entire life consisted of doing absolutely nothing but smoking weed and playing games on his precious PS4. (I love video games myself but there\u2019s a point where it becomes too much) \n* He didn\u2019t have a job when we moved in, he didn\u2019t clean up after himself, and he was really inconsiderate. He would be up all night screaming on his mic, playing Fortnite or whatever. Any time I\u2019d try to bring my concerns about him up to boyfriend, he would dismiss it with some sympathetic excuse. \u201cHe\u2019s just in a bad place right now.\u201d Or something along those lines. Honestly if it were true and he was actually trying to get a job or do anything remotely productive, I wouldn\u2019t have cared so much, but I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say that this man, this 23 year old man, did absolutely nothing with his life. My first bad experience with Frank was when boyfriend and I started to clean out that extra room that his parents offered us. I found out that I was pregnant shortly after we moved in and it became a priority for me to fix up this room so that we\u2019d have our own privacy and a nice room for us and the baby. However, this room was filled to the brim with trash. Frank\u2019s trash. To elaborate, Frank\u2019s lazy fuckin\u2019 ass, instead of ever taking his trash out of his room for months would just throw it in this extra room. I\u2019m not joking when I say that this room was just filled with months and months worth of trash bags and cans and old garbage. So boyfriend and I spent about a week cleaning out this room because there was so much garbage and the floor and walls were really dirty too. After several days of throwing shit away and scrubbing the hell out of this room, the only things left in the room was a really gross old couch and an armchair that we decided we would have to dispose of at a later date. \n* Guess what? Frank, knowing that we just did that kept just throwing his trash in there. With no regard for the fact that we just cleaned the whole thing. I was pissed. But I\u2019m a really nice person and I absolutely hate confrontation so I asked boyfriend to talk to him about it and let him know that it wasn\u2019t very considerate of him to keep throwing his trash in there. Boyfriend said that Frank agreed to clean it up. Since we couldn\u2019t do anything with the room until we got the gross furniture out of it, we left it alone and continued to sleep in the living room, assuming that Frank would take care of the garbage like he said he would. Well, a couple of weeks went by and the next time I went into the room I saw 7-8 additional trash bags accumulated in the corner of the room. I was super annoyed and told boyfriend that Frank had completely disregarded what we asked. So boyfriend talked to him again and Frank kept saying he\u2019d get to it. This trash kept piling up over the next two months and I was furious. Out the window had gone my non-confrontational self and I was prepared to take each bag of trash and dump them on Frank\u2019s bed. But boyfriend stopped me from doing this. You see, boyfriend, for whatever reason didn\u2019t really ever call out Frank for being an asshole. Boyfriend and Frank had this close relationship (probably because they\u2019re brothers) despite me despising Frank, and boyfriend fulling acknowledging that he was rude and lazy. So boyfriend told me to just tell their parents that he was still throwing his crap in the room and we did. His parents didn\u2019t do much besides threaten to take away van privileges from Frank. (Me, boyfriend and Frank were sharing boyfriend\u2019s parents extra van.) \n* So the weeks kept going by and Frank still kept putting off cleaning up the trash. Finally, boyfriend offered to even help Frank clean the trash and take it to the dump with him if he agreed to take care of it that weekend. Frank agreed. Well, Friday came, and then Saturday. Finally that Sunday boyfriend got Frank to agree to do it. Well, the time came and boyfriend said he was going to start loading the van with the bags. Guess what? Frank sat there and played video games the entire time. Didn\u2019t lift a finger to help clean up HIS OWN FUCKING TRASH that HE HAD BEEN THROWING IN THERE FOR MONTHS. And nothing happened to him. His parents didn\u2019t do anything and he never apologized. The whole time all of this was going on by the way, he left messes in the kitchen and I was usually the one to clean them. He\u2019d bring piles of dirty dishes into the kitchen and leave them in the sink. The only reason I did them was because I offered to clean for boyfriend\u2019s family because they were nice enough to let us stay there when we first moved in and didn\u2019t have money or jobs. Eventually bf and I got jobs. Boyfriend worked at a care home and I worked at a call center as it was something easy I could do while I was pregnant. Then, Frank got a girlfriend, and boy was she a piece of work. \n* Just to give you an idea of what she was like, she talked openly about being basically a prostitute and having several abortions because of all the times she had slept with men without protection. She would come over wearing a bra and booty shorts with fish net stalkings and thigh high boots. Look, I\u2019m really not trying to shame the way she dressed because I honestly don\u2019t normally care, but my point is that she just seemed really promiscuous. She offered me a cigarette (while I was pregnant and knew that I had only quit once I found out I was) and I was still in the process of getting over the addiction and she went on about how her friend smoked throughout her pregnancy and was fine. Then this girl developed a \u2018girl crush\u2019 on me and even tried to get in the bedroom to \u2018cuddle\u2019 with boyfriend and I. Frank\u2019s brother. Anyway, once Frank started dating this girl he started to be extra inconsiderate. He would be gone all day and night when he wasn\u2019t home playing games because he was off with this girl. Remember, we were sharing that van with him and he would take it all day long or overnight and wouldn\u2019t tell us when he was coming back. There were times where I had to show up late/miss work entirely because he had it, knew I had work, but proceeded to not care because he was getting laid. Then he really crossed a line for me. One day, I was looking for my microphone which I used for freelance voice acting in my spare time to make extra money. It was kind of like a secondary job/hobby that I really enjoyed and I had a fairly expensive microphone that I used to record with. Well I knew exactly where I had left it and I suddenly couldn\u2019t find it anywhere. I asked boyfriend and he said that he didn\u2019t know but he would ask Frank. \n* Let me tell you guys another problem with Frank that I had known about for awhile. Frank would take his things to the pawn shop alllll the time to buy weed. He would take his games, his spare controllers, anything that he could take to get money because he didn\u2019t have a job but he just HAD to get his weed. The thing is though, Frank wouldn\u2019t just take his things anymore because Frank eventually had taken everything he had of value, and had become desperate. He started taking things that weren\u2019t his, but the things he took were usually my boyfriend\u2019s family\u2019s things, like old DVDs that no one watched, or old video games. He even took his little sister\u2019s laptop at one point. Things that didn\u2019t concern me... because I never thought he would cross that line. What had I done to him except clean up after him and ignore his rude behavior for months? I thought I was immune from his stealing because surely he wouldn\u2019t do that to me, right? I bet you can see where this is going. Boyfriend confronted Frank and asked him if he had seen my mic, and Frank told bf the truth, surprisingly. Frank told boyfriend that he put my microphone in on a loan and would get it back because he was going to have a job soon, and had gotten a call back for a job at a car dealership, and that he was going to start working soon. So basically the way the loans work at the pawn shop is that they would keep anything you put in for 3 months, giving you the opportunity to buy your stuff back before they sell it, but if you do decide to buy it back, the interest goes up everyday that they hold it for you. This. Fucking. Dude. He put my $150 microphone in the pawn shop along with his other PS4 controller for $25. Boyfriend talked to him about it and said it wasn\u2019t cool and that he should do something about it.\n*  And guess what? Much to my surprise he did get that job that he was talking about. 2 weeks goes by, he gets his first paycheck. But Frank, being the procrastinator that he is always had an excuse. \u201cI had some things I had to take care of, I\u2019ll get it next paycheck for sure.\u201d Another two weeks. Nothing. This goes on until the very last week that the pawn shop was willing to hold my mic. The same situation with the trash happened, I told his parents and they were mad at him but ultimately didn\u2019t do anything except bug him about it. His parents said he felt really bad and claimed that Frank thought it was bf\u2019s microphone. Even though he had seen me use it several times. So finally after the 3 months was almost up and Frank has failed to get it out for me, I had boyfriend get him to come to the pawn shop with us, (because whoever puts something in has to be there to get it out) and I paid for it with my own money, along with HIS controller because he put them in together. $80 something dollars. So let me put this into prospective for you. I paid $80 something dollars for him to steal my microphone so that he could buy fucking weed, and he still didn\u2019t apologize to my face. I heard from boyfriend and his parents about how Frank felt \u201cso bad.\u201d At this point I was fucking livid and absolutely done with this inconsiderate piece of shit. I had put up with him for months and I was furious. And as much as I wanted to yell at him and punch him in his stupid, smug little face, I kept my cool, (partially because of bf begging me to) and I did nothing.\n*  Now, fast forward to us trying to get this gross old furniture out of the room finally. Boyfriend couldn\u2019t move the couch on his own, and asked Frank to help him. Of course, Frank was playing video games and didn\u2019t want to help, but according to boyfriend, he had agreed to help at \u2018some point\u2019 so now boyfriend was asking him. He begrudgingly got up, made damn sure that we knew it was such an inconvenience for him. He said this exact quote when asked to get off his ass and help so we could make this room inhabitable for us and his soon to be nephew: \u201cI\u2019m not tryin\u2019 to do all this. YOU GUYS are the ones who are moving in here, NOT ME.\u201d With a few annoyed sighs and groaning thrown in. So boyfriend and Frank tried to move this couch for a whopping 5-10 minutes before Frank gave up, saying that there was no way they were going to get it through the door. (Eventually I had another friend help us break it apart and get it out) The only favor we\u2019ve ever asked this fucking asshole for, and he made it seem like we were asking for an arm and a leg. We literally just wanted help moving this couch so we had space to put things for us and our soon-to-be-born son. At this point I\u2019m sick and tired of him and his fucking video games. I\u2019m sick of him acting like a fucking child and I\u2019m at my limit. This asshole has done nothing the entire time boyfriend and I have been there but be an inconsiderate asshole. I know I\u2019ve probably said inconsiderate at least 3 or 4 times now to describe him, but that\u2019s honestly the best word to describe the way he was. I honestly can\u2019t imagine being a fraction of the piece of absolute shit that this guy is. \n* Now, up until this point I\u2019ve said nothing directly to him. I\u2019ve let this asshole walk all over me and done nothing because boyfriend didn\u2019t want me to. So here\u2019s the thing that finally set my off to get revenge on Frank. It was honestly just something small that tipped me over the edge. I had went to work like any normal day, but the thing is, since both me and boyfriend were working, (Frank had lost his job by this point.) one of them had to take me to work and pick me up when I was done because we all needed the car at different points of the day. So boyfriend would normally drop me off and pick me up unless he had work, then Frank would pick me up. Well this day at work I was tired and wanted to go home. Boyfriend was working so Frank was supposed to pick me up at 5pm, which is the same time I got off every day. Well, my shift ended and I waited outside for Frank to show up. I waited and waited until about 25 minutes. I kept texting Frank asking where he was when about 45 minutes after my shift was over when I got a text from Frank saying that he \u2018forgot\u2019 that he was supposed to pick me up, and when he realized it, he was in the middle of an online match. So, he didn\u2019t even leave to pick me up until about 45 minutes after my shift ended. It took about fifteen minutes to drive to my work. So I sat outside in the cold for about an hour waiting for him to pick me up. I dunno why but that was it for me. \n* That was the final straw that sent me into a silent rage. So I thought of something that I could do to get back at him. And I waited and waited (because his ass hardly left the house) for the perfect opportunity to exact my revenge. One day he finally left to go pick up boyfriend from his shift. Finally, they were both gone. I went into Frank\u2019s room, and his PS4 was left on a Youtube video. I slammed my fist down hard on it several times, but it still seemed to be working. I went and found a paper clip and bent it into a straight line. Went back into his room and shoved that shit into the HDMI port and wiggled it around violently until the screen went black. Then I went into the kitchen and grabbed a few eggs from the fridge and placed them in his trash and broke one under his couch. Made sure I rubbed it into the carpet so that nice rotten egg smell would be hard for him to get out, if his lazy ass even cared enough to try. Then I walked out and pretended like I didn\u2019t do anything. Him and boyfriend came home and went into his room, probably to smoke together. I\u2019ll never forget the pure satisfaction that came when I heard him, distraught over his suddenly \u2018broken\u2019 Ps4. He was raging so hard over it. He kept saying \u201cI DON\u2019T UNDERSTAND!! IT WAS WORKING FINE WHEN I LEFT\u201d I even walked by and asked what was wrong, giving false sympathy, meanwhile laughing internally. I didn\u2019t tell boyfriend what I did because I was afraid he would be upset with me. \n* But here\u2019s the thing, the whole reason I fucked up his PS4 (besides just wanting petty revenge) was to take pleasure in seeing him go without his precious video games until he could afford another one. Which I figured wouldn\u2019t be for a loooooong time. But ohhh nooo, poor Frank couldn\u2019t go a full 24 hours without video games so you know what he did? He went the VERY NEXT DAY, with his best friend to some fucking store I can\u2019t remember the name of and fucking FINANCED A BRAND NEW $300 PS4 PRO!!! So long story short, he couldn\u2019t live 1 day without his fucking Playstation. Part of me is really annoyed that I ultimately didn\u2019t stop him from playing his stupid video games, but I guess the other part of me is happy that he has to make monthly payments to do so. Never heard anything about the eggs, but I secretly hope that he had to endure at least some amount of rotten egg odor.\n*  Also, after I got my revenge, he took my microphone to the pawn shop AGAIN and I never got it back. Then boyfriend and I moved shortly after we had our son so thankfully we aren\u2019t living with him anymore. But lemme add one more thing because karma ended up getting him for me. That brand new PS4 Pro he got? It stopped reading discs so now he can only play games that he downloads onto his Playstation. It\u2019s not exactly what I had in mind, but it\u2019s something. And he\u2019s still making payments on it. I guess karma\u2019s a bitch, as they say.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Tldr: My boyfriend\u2019s asshole brother pissed me off so I broke his Playstation.",

            "selftext": "It's the first freshman year of highschool, math class, well more like after class. We were just doing our thing when one of the lads, who we'll call Ranjul was just sticking his hand into one of the pillars in our classroom, yes it had a hole. Inside it he had on his hand: a piece of paper which said \"I'm gonna rape you (Insert Korean Name Here) tonight\". We didn't really think too much of it until the next day when we arrived to school early to see another piece of paper on the chair of (Insert Korean Name Here). This was getting real suspicious so me and the lads handed it over to the teacher and explained. She asked who found it first and we said Ranjul found it first. She then accused Ranjul of doing it, we then defended him and assured it wasn't him. She then submitted to me and the lads and told us not to get involved. But you all know that the lads don't just sit down and watch from the audience; we get down and dirty into this.\n\nWe form our little detective agency in our school. Not many people; just me, Ranjul, another one who we'll call Curt, and an Arab lad who we'll all call Ahmed. We jot down notes and find our culprit through the process of interrogation and elimination. We actually worked on this for weeks until we narrow it down to a guy who we'll call Douchebag. Douchebag was a real douchebag, he claims he's rich and brags about f**king Fortnite of all things and he has so many skins, malaka this guy's just embarrassing if anything. We try to play it cool and know more about him and this whole kerfuffle. We confirmed our suspicions when he was writing down another message during the lunch period when no one was in the classroom. We then took a picture of him red handed and this son of a b**ch just goes down town and f**king eats the paper. I'm not joking at all, we then yelled at him to stop this instance and punches Ahmed in the gut, Curt then chases him down while I ran for a teacher. He just straight up lies saying\"It's just a prank man chill\". He got expelled on the spot and he will never go to another school again in our province. Me and the lads were then awarded a 5% increase on our total grade which totally just saved my ass. Ass with Douchebag, I honestly think he's giving handjobs in an alley for like 15 bucks",

            "selftext": "\nMy grandparents got married very young - 16 (her) 18 (him). Despite coming from poverty, they somehow built a life together that was very comfortable. My grandfather was able to retire from a white collar job with a substantial pension (~$90k a year) and a lot of savings thanks to my grandmother always being very, very thrifty.\n\nMy grandmother got sick and died within a year and a half. During that time I took leave from my job (I was 22 at the time) and married my boyfriend in a really crappy shotgun wedding that my mom pulled together in an afternoon because it was my grandmothers wish to see us get married. \n\nWe had an apartment at the time with a roommate but now that we were married we needed a house to start our lives. During her chemo appointments my grandmother helped me pick out a little house and said that they would help us pay for it. The market was competitive and they gave us the cash to buy it. ($200,000) We bought the house and refinanced it, paying back back a little more than half.\n\nMy grandmother died at home and it was awful. She was so thrifty that she had no nice clothes.  In spite of the fact that she drove a brand new luxury car, owned a gorgeous house on the beach, etc. my mother bought her a pretty pair of pajamas to wear on her death bed (in home hospice care).  For the next year I continued to cut back on my hours (I have a very flexible job) and spent a LOT of time with him and my parents. My family bent over backwards for him to feel comfortable and wanted. He doesn't have a relationship with his other children or grandchildren.\n\nFast forward a year. He reconnects with a woman he had always had a crush on since high school. She rebuffs him until he starts laying on the gifts. He buys her luxury purses, let's her drive my grandmothers nearly mint condition luxury car and invites her on our family trip abroad. \n\nFamily is just happy that he has a companion so no one minds the extra person on our trip. However, we barely saw him... The trip was spent with her picking out souvenirs and jewelry for herself, her children and her grandchildren.... and him footing the bill. Okay, awkward but okay.\n\nFlash forward to present day. After a year long courtship he buys her a big diamond ring, planned a fancy wedding at the country club, and took a month long honeymoon in Europe. He has essentially dropped my family and embraced hers.  He spends all his holidays with her, has BBQs and only invites her family, doesn't remember anyone's birthday, etc. When he got engaged he didn't tell me or my siblings. We heard through the grapevine. \n\nI attended the wedding but my family was placed on the far edge of the venue.  He didn't speak to me at the wedding.  Since that time he has asked me twice to get lunch. I have had obligations both times and didn't bother rescheduling. \n\n\nA few days ago he asked me to lunch again and I told him that until he learns how to treat me and the people I care about better I want nothing to do with him.  That sent him into a tirade- sending mean messages to my mother and my husband.\n\nSo now I have received a message from him saying that he has had an expensive year and needs to be fully reimbursed as he is planning to buy his new wife (they are both 80) a new car as she wrecked my grandmothers car and he has to get hearing aids.\n\nI am fully aware of his financial situation- pension, savings, big boat, house on the beach and a rental property.  But I also know his new wife spends a lot of money on herself and her children. While my grandmother cooked all their meals- he now goes out to nice dinners 7 days a week. My grandmother never treated herself- now he is paying for weekly hair and nails appointments. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to pay him the remaining amount? \n\nSide note: My grandmother did not leave an inheritance for anyone.",

            "selftext": "Hello, this is my first post to this subreddit.\n\nThis story depicts how I had taken revenge against my Abusive girlfriend, who cheated on me.\n\nBackstory:Me and my girlfriend , who we will call Ellie, met through college and eventually started dating and then got in a relationship.\n\nI was financially stable due to having a 80% scholarship and a well paying job. Ellie was also somewhat financially stable,  but had college fees to pay.\n\nWe moved into an apartment soon after starting our relationship. \n\nThings went pretty smooth for 8 months or so.Soon after 8 months , Ellie started to become very aggressive and sad. She would Sob about bills and debt she had gotten into as she was fired due to a biased boss. \n\nShe emotionally blackmailed me to pay for her debt that was reaching 5 figures. I had refused as I couldn't handle that with college costs.\n\nThings got worse from here .\nShe Blackmailed me everyday to pay her debt.\nShe constantly threatened me . She said sentences like,\"If you don't pay everything I owe, you are a bad person and I WILL break up with you!\"\n\nThis hurt. I loved her and despite her verbal abuse, I cared for her and spent countless nights sleepless,  to help her be happy.\n\nShe became happy all of a sudden. She was happy when I wasn't around. I decided to space away from her for a bit as she did too.\n\nWe soon got back together a month later. She seemed happy with me , I was happy with her, things were going great again. \n\nShe suddenly became physically abusive one day , just because I was on my job and was working overnight . She smashed a glass bottle on my head , keyed my car and broke up with me.\n\nI was torn.\n\nIt took me a good 3-4 weeks to get over this, to some extent . My friend Micheal, told me that she was dating a new guy. \n\nWe will call the new boyfriend Bill. \n\nBill was someone who I necessarily did not like as he had a very repulsive and loud attitude. \n\nI had seen him and ellie quite a lot on social media while we were separated. \n\nI never thought about this. Ellie had been cheating on me for 3 months. That would explain her happiness and why she dumped me.\n\nBill worked at a company that was affiliated with the company that I worked for.\n\nSince I was recently promoted to the sales manager,  I was responsible for conducting meetings with other companies for business deals and commercial opportunities . \n\nBehold , Bill was there at my meeting . The meeting was also perfect. The company was placed under liquidation by the state government for illegal practices , mainly a pyramid scheme. We were aware  of this. But the company representative , Bill wasn't aware we knew. He asked us to provide funding to fight a lawsuit. (Employees rolled out fast , collecting there paychecks and quitting bonuses.) They didn't have funds due to this. I refused obviously. \n\nThe company was shut down and gone for good.\n\nThis resulted in Bill, losing his job and his only source of income. Micheal , friend of Bill told me that Ellie had broken up with him and was alone.\n\nEllie showed up at my house  flirtatiously .\n\nI let her in , let her have a few drinks and once she loosened from alcohol,  I interrogated her , while recording . She said she had taken up  marijuana (illegal where I live) and was an escort(also illegal).\n\nWith this information,  I waved her goodbye,  smiling as hard as I could.\n\nDown I came with Evidence of The verbal abuse, physical abuse and her Illegal activities. \n\nShe was arrested and got jailtime and was charged A hefty fine.\n\nShe later came out of prison and had an Overdose of alcohol,  died later that week.\n\nShes gone, but I seem happy about it.",

            "selftext": "BACKSTORY:\n\nMe and 'Alice' met 6 months ago. We felt a spark between us and felt we should marry even had the family planning. She loved outdoors. We both hated fast food. She was very concerned about me as I am a Cancer survivor.(Apparently what I thought).\n\nI am a CEO of a local firm. Even though I am not 30 yet I had gifted her pretty expensive gifts. I gave her a $4000 ring on her birthday.\n\nI gifted her a car so that she could go to school complete her study on medicine. It was a Dodge Challenger in the devil purple and it is sick. \n\nI always trusted her and she had met my family and I had known her entire family.\n\nI had been friends with Alex . We were pretty close. When I got to know that my girl and Alex's girl were friends, our relationship became stronger. We used to hangout together when we got time.\n\nThis happened on one of the sunday of May . We were exploring a park nearby that Alex's girl invited a friend of hers to the park. This man shows up and you know what...?\n\nHe is MY friend from HIGH SCHOOL.\nLet's put his name 'Max'. He was a cool guy when we were in high school, pretty chill, awesome at sports.\nNow he was broke and lived with his parents. However we had not been in touch.\n\nWe talked that day and then exchanged numbers.\nApparently my girl also noted his number when he gave it to me. \n\n5 days later it was Alex's birthday. We met that day and they seemed pretty close. It was strange to me as she constantly touched her belly from her space between her dress. I remained calm cause I knew she was extremely friendly with almost every person she meets but this was straight forward STRANGE.\n\nThat day I got a call stating that my sister expired. She died in a car accident. I was upset and Alex and her girl tried to cheer me up .. Amazingly SHE continued to flirt with him never even looking at me .\n\nI went to my apartment. I was pretty low. I didn't pick Alice's phone. I was trying to think how the ceremony would take place. Three days from accident I invited her to my sister's ceremony. She refused stating she had to complete her homework and get the assignments ready. \n\nThis is when it struck to me that she would be cheating on me. I contacted Alex's girl and told to keep an eye on her.\n\n6 days later Alex's girl and Max invited me to mall stating they had to discuss something personal and then I knew she was cheating. I decided to go there with my brother and my colleague who is a lawyer.\n\nAlice was not there . Alex's girl or old me that MAX and ALICE were in a relationship from the next day they met.She spent time with him at his mom's house. The day I invited her to my sister's ceremony she was in HIS bed , **NAKED**. \n\nTHE REVENGE:\n\nMax had photos to prove it and asked sorry to me. He said that it was her who pounced on him. He said that she was the one who proposed her.\n\nI couldn't believe them. I asked them to call her and ask them to come to the mall. She said she didn't want to see MY face. They said i wasn't here.\n\nMeanwhile my friend (lawyer) went to washroom and took all the photos from Max's phone.  Now we hid so that she doesn't see me when she comes.\n\nShe came. Sat down.\n\nI went straight forward to her and asked what it was all about. She got FURIOUS about me asking her on her cheating on ME. She slapped me and hurdled abuse to me. She left crying. Everybody in the mall thought I was the wierd guy.\n\nMy friend stopped me and said that he had the perfect revenge in mind. \n\nThe next day he went to her and asked for the ring and my car. She REFUSED and abused him too.\n\nThat same day Max called me and said that she doesn't trust her. He said he was sorry but said that it wasn't his fault when she leaned on him. \n\nI said it was cool with him.\n\nTwo days later Alice calls me saying that she feels sorry and wants to reunite our relationship.\n\nMy lawyer friend said that I should invite her to the same mall .\n\nNow it was Sunday again and we met.\nMy friend had a suitcase filled with pics and her conversation. I talked to her parents that I would send them some information about me and Alice,they were probably expecting me to propose Alice to marry me. I told them not to tell a word to Alice about me contacting them. They didn't.\n\nShe came all dressed up and asked how I was and started saying that she was low. It was her periods and she needed somebody and I wasn't there.\n           BITCH MY SISTER EXPIRED.\n\nNow I asked her for my ring and she refused to give it. She said it was hers legally because it was a gift from me to her. My lawyer friend walked in and said that it was rightfully mine. I asked for my car too. She denied giving these things and constantly asked for my forgiveness. She said she was not with him,they hadn't done anything blah blah blah.\n\nMy friend walked in with his briefcase showing her pic to everyone who were lunching on that floor and especially the staff.  \n\nI sent those pics to her parents and her friends too. \n\nThis was she time she was DEAD. Her face grew pale. Her parents called her and she fell unconscious. Nobody helped her because of what she did. She woke up herself crying yet and left the mall. She gave me my Challengers key and the ring. \n\nOoh it was the sweetest revenge ever.",

They had been together since college and were the same age, with my dad being a month older.   \n \n\n I'm 22 and an only child, and am about to graduate college with my degree in chemistry. I went to college on a full ride scholarship. This is important later.   \n\n\n  My dad met my now stepmom when she was my mom's nurse at the hospital where she spent her final days. My stepmom \"Grace\" played all the right notes to gain my dad's trust.   \n\n\n  She was empathetic to him, nurturing, comforting after my mom passed.   \n\n\n  I was seventeen and old enough to sense that she was just trying to weasel her way into getting my dad's resources, but it was up to my dad if he wanted to be in a relationship with her. I was a senior in high school and had just won a scholarship to attend college out of state the following year.   \n\n\n  My dad mourned my mom for a year and that whole time Grace would check in on him by phone every month or so, in my opinion to scope out the possibility of sinking her hooks in him.   \n\n\n  After a year passed Grace took the gloves off and went hard after my dad. Grace was only 40 when she and my dad started seeing each other. I didn't like her but at the same time my dad at least didn't seem so depressed anymore, so I tried to be less pessimistic about her and give her the benefit of the doubt.   \n\n\n  In my gut I didn't trust her, though.   \n\n\n  But we are Scandinavian and at least in my family the son does not tell his father what to do or even offer any opinion. Grace is from the Czech Republic if you're wondering.     \n\n\n  My father was a very successful banker during his career, and amassed quite a portfolio of wealth.   \n\n\n  I'll spare you the details, but after six months of dating, Grace and my father are married.   \n\n\n  My dad never really got over my mom though, and he was getting weaker and weaker even though he was only 57.   \n\n\n  Since his health was fading he called me to him and asked me point blank, \"boy, what do you need to set you up in this life?\"   \n\n\n  I told him I don't need anything, I'm a man and can take care of myself, but what are you even talking about dad, you're going to be around for decades yet. I did remind him that he had living sisters with children (my aunts and cousins). I also reminded him that I had a full scholarship to college so don't worry about giving me any cash.   \n\n\n  He was dead only a year later.   \n\n\n  I of course have seen lots of Hollywood movies so I consider the conspiracy theory that maybe my dad's nurse wife poisoned him and made him sign over all his money to her, but I really honestly do not think that's what happened. Other relatives didn't like Grace either, but they knew my dad was totally in love with my mom and that her death utterly broke him.   \n\n\n  Well long story short, my dad bequeathed his five bedroom house to me even though I wasn't expecting it and didn't ask for it. He gave a small endowment to each of his sisters and their children.   \n\n\n  He left about 80% of all his existing money to Grace, which amounted to several hundreds of thousands of dollars. My dad ignored me because he's generous to a fault and still gave me several tens of thousands of dollars, which were of course very useful to me.   \n\n\n  Grace tried to put on a friendly front but I could tell she was angry as hell that she didn't get my dad's house, too. That belonged to me, and I had the legal papers to prove it. She was especially mad because we live in an extremely upscale and trendy location, and houses are hard to come buy and easily sold for massive profit.   \n\n\n  During the first few months after my dad's death, I had the nauseating, creepy experience of knowing that Grace was trying to feel me out to see if I might be into a little relationship with her.   \n\n\n  Um, GROSS.   \n\n\n  She still stayed at the house though because over the last three years she had gotten used to living there and acting like she owned it. And, even though I officially owned it, I was always away at college and only visited my dad's old house once every couple of months, and even then it wasn't to see Grace, but to see my cousins who lived just a few miles away. I downplayed the fact that it was really my house, and over the months and years I think Grace gradually forgot that she really had no legal right to the house. She probably believed that sooner or later, because I never asked her for any of the hundreds of thousands of my dad's dollars that she now had, that I was somehow independently wealthy and would just give up my house to her.   \n\n\n  I knew I'd eventually hydrogen bomb this b\\*tch when she started dating some new guy only five months after my dad was in the ground, and one time when I came home from college after graduating she and her new boyfriend (some sleazy looking D-bag named \"Ivan\" who was only a few years older than me) were acting like I was a guest in my own house and that they owned it.   \n\n\n  I played along.   \n\n\n  Grace told me she gave away my Playstation 4 to Ivan's cousin because \"I'm too old to play with video games.\"   \n\n\n  I don't even know this motherf\\*cker and you give him my PS4 to give away to some other sh\\*t who I also don't know?   \n\n\n  I smiled but I knew what I had to do eventually.   \n\n\n  She also said that she and Igor were getting married because \"I just can't mourn your father forever. I have to move on with life.\"   \n \n\n I tell her that I graduated college and already secured employment with a local firm, and \"will soon find a new place to live.\"   \n\n\n  She looks thrilled. Especially the part where it looks like I'll soon have a new place to live. Then in a patronizing way she tells me, \"you always have a place in our house though, you are welcome to stay whenever you please.\"   \n\n\n  Thanks, Grace, really generous of you.   \n\n\n  What I really say is that I will probably have a new place in three months.   \n\n\n  She says that is wonderful because she intends to go to her homeland to have a wedding with Ivan and afterward have her honeymoon. She assures me it's a local affair \"otherwise I'd invite you, honey. And anyway I know you're so busy.\"   \n\n\n  I congratulate her.   \n\n\n  She asks me if I can watch the house for her.   \n\n\n  Watch my own house? Sure.   \n\n\n  What I really say is of course I will take care of the house. I am careful to not say \"your house.\"   \n\n\n  She and her D-bag fiance (who I am 100% sure is only there for Grace's money) go on their trip and I immediately put out advertisements in rental websites offering to lease my house. I hire movers and have all of Grace's furniture and possessions boxed up and put into a storage rental facility. I retain all of my parents' furniture that they had before my dad met Grace.     \n\n\n  Within days, I am inundated with inquiries regarding my amazing, furnished house with fantastic views. I rent it to a wonderful young family. A barrister and his schoolteacher wife and their two preteen children. They pay me their first and last month's rent, and sign a lease for a year. I warn them about my crazy stepmom who thinks this is her house, but I present them with contact information to my lawyer (the same lawyer my dad retained) in case they need any assurance that I'm on the level.     \n\n\n  I also give this lawyer the information about the storage facility, including the fact that I generously paid four months of storage in advance.   \n\n\n  I then found a wonderful apartment in the city near my new place of work. There I met a woman in a restaurant I frequent at night after a long workday. We have been dating six months now and are engaged to be married.   \n\n\n  Grace of course tried to shriek and cause trouble when she realized she got kicked out of MY house but my lawyer quickly shut her mouth without my having to ever speak to her garbage face again.   \n\n\n  From what I hear, her and her trash husband left the country and I assume they're blowing through my dad's money and will soon be broke like Chavs usually become when they taste a little bit of what they think is the good life. So maybe Grace will go and try to exploit some other lonely man into giving her his money.   \n\n\n  Speaking of money, the house that I rent out is generating so much money that I not only am able to help pay for my nieces' college, but I moved into a larger apartment of my own. I love my job but really, I could survive solely on renting my dad's old house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n And to think. If Grace had only been cooler and nicer I might have let her stay at the house, just to be a good sport. And definitely if she stayed the hell out of my room.  \n\n\n  But no, she had to act all proprietary, so I had to make her homeless as a wedding gift. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPostscript. I bought another PS4, even though I didn't even use my old one that much. It didn't matter. It wasn't for Grace to give away. You don't give away other people's things. You give away your OWN things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich is why I chose to kick Grace out of my house. Because it's mine, and I decide who stays there.",

The project was about making a product that will contribute to global warming (usual environmental science stuff). I did not know the people I was working with as this was only a few days into the first semester. Me and this other kid (let's call him Josh) are coming up with ideas while the other two (Let's call them Stacy and Jess) didn't do anything but sit and gossip.\n\nA few days into the project and I decided I had had enough of them not working. I decide to tell the teacher (not a cool move ik) and he agreed to keep an eye on them as they would pretend to work when he went around.\n\nMe and Josh finished the project and turned it in. Stacy and Jess helped present which was their only contribution. The next day I check my grades and I had gotten a 96% on the assignment. Later that day during lunch who should come complaining about their grades but Stacy and Jess. They told me that Josh and I must have done a poor job because they got F's. I didn't say anything. They barely passed the class by the end of the year.",
