I've tried helping her and offer to get her some help but to be shut down and scolded for reccomending it at all. (Just some context for the story but still feels it doesn't justify this situation)\n\nI come home one day after work and check comes in and its short we argue i sort things out she goes to take a bath and we leave each other alone for the time being to cool off in my head. She comes out of the bath explaining she has a razor blade in the restroom and tells me \"why didn't you check on me I could have killed myself and you wouldn't even care or have noticed\" mind you she hasn't done anything before (she says she has and had texted me she was but when we broke up I went back and looked at all our old convos and found nothing). So we argue some more and she tells me how miserable her life is and how unhappy she is with everything including me and the relationship so I snapped went into the kitchen grabbed a knife and yelled \"if your so miserable then do it and end it all if you aren't happy with your life\" slam the knife in the table next to her and leave the room slamming the door. \n\nSnapping back to reality after a short few mins I run in and see she's crying and the knife isn't moved at all, grab it and throw it away. We broke up obviously but over some other issues we had had (i.e her cheating on me with other people online way before this incident with a lot of people she \"loved\") I've told a few friends maybe 2 or 3 people but they told me It was a double edged sword situation.\n\nIt was a few years ago but I find myself thinking of it off and on when I feel down and feel awful about it to this day. It just rolls in my mind knowing if I told anyone how they would see me as a person. Found out she was manipulative and a few other things too but even after finding that all out I still feel sick to my stomach from time to time when I think about it feeling I could never really help her out even though I've tried so many times for so many years and nothing seemed to work.\n\nKnowing what I did makes me feel I cant help anyone and telling anyone this makes me feel disgusting and have people seem me in a new and an unsightly way. I've since tried to feel better by helping some close friends with  and suicidal thoughts feeling guilty for what I'm did.\n\nMy ex is happier now (heard from a mutual friend I haven't spoken to her since we broke up) and she isnt suicidal or  anymore so I figure it's all something that water under the bridge type scenario but for me it sits in my mind thinking I can never truly feel like I can make up for what I did to someone I loved so much and if I do snap and repeat it again what happens next. These thoughts just ache me and my mind.",

            "selftext": "My parents\u2019 relationship has deteriorated for years and they are like strangers forced to be in a marriage (till my sis F25 and I F21 have transitioned into work (Disclaimer we are asians in an asian country)). My dad is the financial support of the family, though my mom has a meagre job with some income, so it stabs her confidence more that we still have to rely on my dad despite him being a bad husband. He is still a good dad, which my mom emphasises to me while complaining about him as a husband.\n\nMy mom, my maternal grandmother and I have a tight-knit relationship and she was a strong emotional support for my mom too. It was a rough time towards the end when my grandmother\u2019s health took a turn for the worse and was basically just waiting for her turn to leave the world. My grandmother became more controlling over my mom\u2019s activities (basically not being at home with her) and of course having to take care of every need and whims of my grandmother: bathing her, cleaning up after her every bowl movements etc. We had to get a maid because we had work and school, which was a tiring fight for against my dad. Our house was full and it was hard to squeeze a stranger in and all, but we got her in the end. Anyway there were more stress and tension behind this whole period, but basically my grandmother passed on in the end and the toll it took on my mother was huge. It\u2019s like she lost a huge part of her life, and maybe even will to live.\n\nMy mom also has a bit of alcoholism issue, trying to numb her sadness with alcohol. I\u2019m absolutely terrified of her health deteriorating because of this, alongside with the fact that my mom is also quite plump. Basically I\u2019m worried that she won\u2019t be able to be with me for a long time.\n\nI love my mom, I really do. The only thing I hate about her is that she is not stronger. Strong enough to protect herself, take care of herself, pull herself together. It hurts me so much to see someone I love falling into . She is an amazing person, a loving mom, and I know I could never be 10% of a mom that she was. \n\nWe were talking about happiness. She said she would be happy if my sis and I were happy, but I didn\u2019t like that. I told her I want her to be happy from something she did or enjoy - I want her to have happiness that stems from herself, not others. She said she knows she is not happy now, she tries to fill up her time by doing voluntary work and seeing others happy in hopes that it will give her happiness too, but she just isn\u2019t. And it hurts me so much, that I can\u2019t think of anything that could help her. She said she just doesn\u2019t have the confidence and will to be happy anymore, it\u2019s like she has given in to fall into a slump.\n\nWhat can I do for my mom? If I had the money, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate at all to send my mom to meet a professional therapist so that they could help her sort her feelings out.",

            "selftext": "Around this time last year i was working in a warehouse. I had been at this job for roughly a year an half and was enjoying it for the most part. It was a night shift position so the pay was well, and i was used to those hours so it worked out. I never cared about doing hard physical labor since i was never really good in school, i knew id be doing it for life. One morning as i was getting off work, i just parked my machine and was walking to our lockers. The walk back is decently long considering the warehouse is over 1million sq ft. On my way i was talking with another co worker and not really paying attention to where i was going.  Without realizing, i walked into a pile of pallets and bumped my shin. I didnt think much of this, only that i was stupid. A few days go on and i have a little bump on the upper part of my tibia. My family/friends all just told me its a bone bruise and it takes awhile for that to go away. Now a few weeks go by and the pain is slightly getting worse but the bump hasn\u2019t gotten any bigger just more fragile to touch. I then try to ignore the pain in hopes that its healing slowly. I drag out a few more weeks of discomfort and had taking a lot of vacation time since I\u2019ve been with the company for 18 months and never taken a day off. I enjoy my time off i went to a festival and had a trip planned to Georgia at the end of the month with some friend to meet our online friends.But a week or two after the festival i woke up and couldn\u2019t walk on my right leg anymore. I then realize this is a lot more serious than i initially thought. I then decide to go to the hospital and get this checked out before our trip. Also this is my first \u201cvacation\u201d if you would call it that since i was 15. So my mom drives me to the hospital to get some X-rays done and see whats going on. We wait a total of 8 hours and finally get my images back to have the doctor tell me he has no idea what this is. On the X-rays you could see this enormous black hole in my upper tibia with hairline cracks all around it. He then wonders how I\u2019ve been walking on this bone and dealing with the pain. I tell him I\u2019ve just tried to ignore it but it just got worse. He prescribes me painkillers and tells me to get an MRI asap. But with this trip coming up in 2 days i said i will wait till i get back which was only a 3 day thing. I spend the whole vacation on awful crutches and a wheelchair and was miserable for the most part.  Come Monday i get back from Georgia  my parents are out of town for 2 weeks on a trip they planned months ago and its just me and my younger brother. \n\nI then go to my appointment and get an MRI done. I have this younger female who likes to just assume things. I get my images back and she sits me down to tell me i have this tumor inside my leg that is massive and trying to escape my bone. She then tells me that my life isn\u2019t really looking good at all.. she explains to me thats is very serious and more than likely will lose my leg. I was left speechless as i thought they were going to say literally anything else. She asks me if i want her to talk to my parents and them being on vacation i didn\u2019t really want to ruin their time. So i have her call my grandma and explain whats going on and shes freaking out. The lady then tell my grandma after she asks what could have cause this and she says \u201cshit luck\u201d i kid you not. I grab my phone and proceed to go home. My grandma told my parents and they were devastated and decided to come back home immediately.  Im glad they did cause i waited a week an half before seeing a real oncologist and i came to acceptance of losing my leg. But knowing i was going to slowly die of something i had no control of and everyone around me would suffer too made me absolutely miserable. So i see this  oncologist who after 2 minutes of looking at my leg, told me were going to do a biopsy of this tomorrow morning and ill tell you the following day. He said he knew it probably was cancer but their is always a chance its malignant. The last thing he wants is for people to overthink an worry. After the biopsy he tells me i have a high grade osteosarcoma. He thens schedules me for surgery the following week to get this out since the cancer was trying to spread. He was surprised i didn\u2019t shatter my bone already given how big the tumor was and that i was walking on my leg for weeks. But he said if i were to break it i would\u2019ve  lost my leg and the cancer could\u2019ve gotten lot worse. Day of my surgery I\u2019m having majority of my tibia removed with lasers then given a cadaver as a replacement. I will also have a skin graft, 2 plates and 14 screws as well as a part of my calf cut and placed on top of my shin as a shield/cast. The surgeries  was a total of 8 hours done by a plastic surgeon,oncologist, and some robots. Now I\u2019m out of surgery and in recovery for the next 6 days. I had my own private room which was nice and most of it was a blur but i remember having 9 catheters and when they\u2019d tend to my skin graft. It was as if someone came in everyday to pull a scab just enough to where they\u2019d could come back and be able to do it again. Last day at the hospital im finally able to get out of bed but cant keep my leg down for more than 30 seconds. I finally leave the hospital on the 28th of august and the 29th is my birthday. The last place i wanted to spend my 22nd birthday. \n\nAfter an hour in the back of a sedan with my leg up i was over it and just wanted to be home. We finally get there and i live in the basement of my parents room. I had planned on moving but with such events i decided not to. This room i live in has no windows and I\u2019ve been down here for 10 years. At first it was cool as a kid but soon becomes very . Its 2 flights of stairs down but since i could only keep my leg down for 30 seconds it would take 20+ minutes to get there. I couldn\u2019t put my leg down rest for a minute and go again they told me roughly 10-15 minutes between each session. Finally in my room and i had just had a pc built and got my room setup to be stuck in for the next few months. I was roughly taking 15+ pills a day all for different things. But not getting addicted to opiates your steadily on every 4-6 hours for months is very hard. Im not a pill person by any means and tend to just stay to marijuana. But dabbing didn\u2019t help as much with the pain as the opiates did and i tried really hard lmao. 2 months out of surgery and I\u2019m able to keep my foot down for 2 minutes at a time now and would be starting chemo and radiation very shortly. With this happening the healing process of my leg would practically stop until treatment was over and was expected a 6-12 month recovery without any problems. My chemo treatment was very aggressive since my cancer was and i spent 3 days a week 8 hours a day getting chemo treatments. This was a 3 day on 18 days off thing. Unfortunately once i started to feel okay it was time for the next treatment. With having my leg restrictions as well i couldn\u2019t really move during chemo and would just pee in a jug thing they\u2019d give me. This went on from mid October till the end of January. After chemo was done i started radiation for 9 and a half weeks. That wasn\u2019t so bad except my mom would have to take off work to drive me an hour away to get 10 minutes of radiation and then drive back. I didn\u2019t mind being bald or even not having eyebrows but the eyelashes messed me up. Everything gets in your eyes and you look like a completely different person. I never took any photos of me like that. I could look in a mirror but i seen no point in having a picture of me in that state. Now i have hair everywhere except my one leg and I\u2019m using a cane now so I\u2019m getting close to walking. I still have a bout a year from now till i can run/jump and do physical sports but i kind of just gave that up. I want a real vacation this time but have no idea what to do. I don\u2019t have a job but i have plenty of money to spend.  I saved a good amount at my job not taking off and working overtime as much as i could. Its been a long 10 months and i cant wait to be normal again. But if i were to ever break this bone the chances of it healing are slim and may need amputation. With that hard labor jobs are kind of out of the question and with my plans of doing that my whole life I\u2019m kind of lost on what i should do. Anyways i thought id share this and if you have any questions or anything id be happy to answer them at this point I\u2019m open to any type of question nothing will offend/embarrass  me.",

            "selftext": "I don't really know where to start or what I expect to gain from posting this. I saw a post on this sub-reddit while flipping through random stuff while I was sitting on the can, and I just felt like posting this is something I wanted to do, but I have no idea why. Maybe I hope it will help, idk.\n\nI feel like a dickhead as I try to type some of this stuff, so bear with me if this starts to sound like I'm just jerking myself off over how great I am or something because it'll hopefully make sense once I get into it.\n\nIf I had to do a TL;DR, I'm between 35 and 40, I've done pretty well at everything that there is to do well at as a man other than have kids (which I'm not interested in), but I don't feel pretty much anything positive about it. I can't talk to anyone I know about this because I'm too afraid it'll just come across as me being an ungrateful jackass, which is what I feel like most days anyway. I apologize in advance if this is super long.\n\nI don't know where to start, so I'll just start with my relationships. I'm pretty great with women. I wasn't always this way, especially when I was in my late teens/early 20s, but I put the work in and figured it out. When I'm single, I have no problem pulling attractive girls online or in person. I have a long-term girlfriend of 5+ years in her mid-20s who could basically be one of these super hot thick-fit \"Instagram models\" if she wanted. She's super smart, graduated with a 4.0, is legitimately one of the hardest-working people I've ever met and she's so goddamn sweet and awesome with kids that it's just ridiculous. She has a full-time job and has built a media-related business that does well also with clients from all over the US.\n\nI have another long-term girlfriend of 7+ years in her late 20s who is pretty great too. We also celebrated our seventh anniversary earlier this week of being together or whatever. She's pretty as fuck, and she's so smart it's ridiculous. She was the first person I ever met in my life that I could spend any amoount of time around and never get bored, and it's still like that today. She's one of those people that when she decides to start working at something that it's pretty much a foregone conclusion that she's going to be successful at it.\n\nThey live with me, and they're really into each other. Despite having been together for years, our sex lives are still going strong, and I can't remember the last time either of them turned me down for sex. They're both super into me to the point of feeling self-conscious about it, and to make that even more fucked up, they're both turned on by me fucking other women. Like what the fuck could I possibly have to complain about.\n\nI'm coming back to put this in after the fact, but I thought it might be notable that one of the only things that consistently makes me feel good at all is if I do something for them. I'm invested in wanting them to be successful and happy.\n\nI feel like a total jackass because I just don't care. When one of them comes to tell me about something exciting they're working on or whatever, I just want them to go away. It's not about what they're saying or that they're excited because I'm glad for them that they are so happy, but it's just the actual act of them talking to me (it could be anyone talking to me) that fucks with me and makes me incredibly anxious. On top of that, I'm super indifferent to all of it, and that adds a shitload of guilt on top of it all. I feel like I'm supposed to feel amazing having these two amazing people in my life, and I just don't feel anything but anxious and annoyed.\n\nI guess I should clarify that I don't feel any of this because of jealousy or insecurity or anything like that. I feel the same about pretty much everything, but I'm also successful myself. In the spirit of being vague enough to maintain my privacy while being specific enough to give anyone reading this an idea, I have a content production and consulting business I've built over the past 10-12 years that does well. Before that, I played poker professionally for 5-6 years after quitting college at the beginning of my senior year (applied mathematics) after becoming disillusioned with academia. I'd been putting myself through school largely from some websites I had built that were bringing in some money.\n\nOne issue I do have is that I'm in a position now where I can make decent money without having to work much, which is lucky and/or a good thing since I can't get motivated to work much at all (I'm talking less than 10 hours a week). I feel a tremendous amount of guilt about this as well because if I put in more time and effort, I could easily be making a shitload of money. The stupid part about it is that I also feel guilt about feeling guilty along the lines of it should be a good thing that I can do as well as I do without having to work much, which is something a lot of people wish they could have.\n\nI've had success in several different areas at several different things, and I feel nothing about it. I feel guilty because it's like I should at least feel proud about it, but I just don't care. It's like there's something broken in me where I don't feel good about things that it would logically make sense for me to feel good about.\n\nI've done a lot to try to fix this or at least to make something change in me to where I feel something about it other than guilt and annoyance. I go for a run about twice a week and lift about twice a week. Sometimes it's once, sometimes it's thrice just depending on the weather and what else I've got going on, but I do that and do a fair amount of yard work and stuff around the house, so I'm pretty active.\n\nI've worked to eat better for a while now. My breakfasts usually consist of sausage, eggs and a piece of toast, though I skip breakfast a lot since I'm often not hungry in the mornings. The rest of my meals are largely centered around steak or chicken in various forms, and I do a lot of cooking. I try to be reasonable about not just piling the rest of my plate with carbs since I have a thing about most green vegetables triggering my gag reflex (I'll explain that one below in case someone wonders wtf I'm talking about). I eat a fair amount of beans as a side; I cook them myself and don't really do the canned beans thing, etc. I drink more caffeine than I probably should, but I've had multiple periods of 6-12 months where I drank no caffeine at all without any relief.\n\nOn the green vegetables thing, when I was like eight years old or so, my mom once forced me to eat these gross canned carrots that I hated that weren't really cooked well (her version of cooking was pouring something from a can into a bowl, putting it in the microwave, stirring it and putting it on the kitchen table). Anyway, I was crying my eyes out and just tried to force myself to eat it since she wouldn't let me get up from the table or whatever if I didn't, and I ended up throwing up like on my plate, on the table, on the floor and whatever, and then she made me eat the carrots I'd thrown up until she eventually just gave up from my crying and shit and told me I could get up and go do whatever after I cleaned up the mess.\n\nI feel kind of bad for bringing that up. From a rational standpoint, I know it was fucked up, and I know my mom was a massive piece of shit for that and a lot of other reasons (and my dad for enablng her), but I don't really feel anything about it. It's just whatever for me.\n\nBack on the topic of things I've tried to fix this shit, I finally went to a therapist when I was like 28 or 29. I hated going for a lot of the same reasons why I'm hating writing this out because I feel self-conscious and guilty talking about the interplay between the things in my life that should make me feel great and the reality that I just feel nothing for them and feel awful all the time.\n\nHis opinion was complex PTSD or C-PTSD. My understanding of it is that my childhood abuse (sexual, physical, emotional and other brands of fucked-up bullshit) basically fucked up my nervous system so that I'm constantly acting as if I'm under threat on a physiological level. I've done a tremendous amount of work on this to little or no avail, and it's actually the reason why I started being more active with running and lifting and shit like that because it helps some people diagnosed with C-PTSD quite a bit. It hasn't done much for me that I can tell, and I don't really like running and lifting (or pretty much anything tbh), but it's just habit at this point and something to do.\n\nI've meditated regularly since my early 20s, and I still do it regularly now. I hate to know how much worse things would be if I hadn't.\n\nI've done a whole lot of reading on the topic, and I've read pretty much everything there is to read on it. What I've read from Bessel van der Kolk, Peter Levine and others has been very helpful in terms of conceptualizing what the issues are, where they come from and why they work the way they do, but it's not been very helpful in terms of relief.\n\nI stopped the going to therapy thing after a while because it just started to seem like Groundhog Day without any progress, and I was paying out of pocket, so it just seemed like a waste of money. The things we talked about were helpful in conceptualizing what was going on and why, much like the bulk of material I've read on the subject, but there wasn't really anything happening to help give me relief.\n\nIt's worth noting that, from my understanding of the material anyway, that relief is a relative term for this and that getting to the point of tolerating and managing symptoms is about the best one can hope for. It's not exactly something that inspires a lot of confidence, but I'm kind of stubborn about trying to figure this shit out.\n\nI've been vaguely suicidal since my late teens and have thought about it at least a couple of times a week for the past 15-20 years. It I've gotten that under control with supplements. My testosterone is supposedly normal. I'm physically at a good BMI, in shape, attractive, etc. I have a lot of tightness through my neck and shoulders all the time and tension headaches pretty often, but that's so common that it's pretty much a given with the C-PTSD thing.\n\nSo yeah, I don't really know what else to say. This is stupid. Bleh. I'm trying to think of anything else that should go here.\n\nI'm very low contact with my parents. I see them once or twice a year, usually Thanksgiving and Christmas. It's basically like I tolerate my mom in those situations in order to see my dad, but as time has went on, I've started caring about seeing him less and less.\n\nI used to have these bouts of rage where I'd just flip shit. Well I still do sometimes, but I used to too. It used to be pretty bad, and I was lucky not to ever get in legal trouble over it because it would happen in public sometimes too. My therapist was of the opinion that I was/am dissocating in some form when that happens, and I don't even know how to describe it, but when it happens, it's like I'm watching my body do things but that I'm not the one in control of what it's doing. It's pretty fucked up, and I had no frame of reference for just what the fuck was going on until my late 20s.\n\nJust understanding what the deal was and how to notice when things are heading in that direction (ie: physical sensations that lead up to it), I've been able to cut that shit down by like 95 percent or more. I used to go off and throw shit, kick shit over, kick through doors, beat shit over my head until it broke and all kinds of fucked up shit before I kind of cooled down. When I was much much younger, like pre-teen and early teens, I would get into a lot of fights because of this kind of thing to give an idea.\n\nAt this point, those bouts of rage are so different that it's almost funny how big of a difference there is. To say it's like night and day is an understatement. I can anticipate when I'm starting to head in that direction because I get a very distinct set of physical sensations, and when that happens, I immediately disengage from whatever is going on and just go walk somewhere else or whatever the case may be. On the off occasion that I do snap and throw something, I'm able to catch myself (which usually coincides with me yelling FUCK) and regain control almost immediately. That happens about once a year or less at this point, and it usually involves something ridiculous. The last time it happened, it was because I got caught one of those sticky fly strips in the side of the face, and by the time I had gotten out \"SON OF A FUCKING [word I apparently can't use in a post on this sub for whatever reason],\" I had already caught myself, which was pretty cool.\n\nThe girls I'm with know about my history both in terms of the anger thing and in terms of the overall mental health issue. They don't really have a frame of reference for how bad it used to be in terms of being around when that was happening, which I'm pretty thankful for, but I've talked about it with them before, and they've seen me do ridiculous shit like spike a cookie in the kitchen floor. I'd say each of them has seen me snap in some form or fashion maybe 4-6 times each, and the worst time lasted about 10-15 seconds.\n\nI'm not happy about it, and I feel guilty about it, but it's very serious and measurable progress compared to the 15-minute tirades I would watch myself go on. The progress I've made on this is one of the reasons why I still think I have a chance of putting a dent in this other shit I have going on.\n\nSo yeah, this is long as fuck, and I expect exactly zero people to read this clusterfuck, but I didn't really write it for sympathy or anything like that. I thought putting it down might make me feel a little better or something, but I mostly just feel like an ungrateful dumbass right now. I'm tempted to not even post this now because I feel stupid about it, but I've already typed up this long-ass thing, so fuck it.",

But that love is fading with each argument, with every evening I spend crying while he apologizes and we try to move on past the things he said to me. I'm ready to leave, but I can't afford to. I have nowhere to go. I'm planning on making a private savings fund so once I can afford the deposit for a new place to live I can bounce. I have no idea how long that will take.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll my friends have disappeared. My lifelong friend I grew up with has completely alienated herself from me, and I have no idea why. When I ask her what's wrong, she just says work is crazy. She was recently in hospital for burnout and since then she has been avoiding me like the plague. And work isn't crazy. She has plenty of time to update her social media and chat to her new bestie, but can't text me back. She's aware I'm not doing well. I always initiate our conversations; she goes through the initial pleasantries and then leaves me on read. When she was in hospital I visited her and supported her, but now that I am going through a rough patch she is just absent. I'm heartbroken, I don't have many other friends, I'm quite introverted and I struggle to meet and connect with new people. It's been like that since my childhood.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI suffer from chronic  and I don't have the money to see a doctor or afford my medicine. I live in a third world country so our state psychiatric care is dismal. So I am off my meds, trying to autopilot through my work days and surviving the evenings with the ticking time bomb that is my SO.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI honestly feel like I'm done with life and want out. Unfortunately both my parents are still alive and I couldn't bear to cause them that kind of pain. Other than them, I honestly don't think anybody would notice if I just disappeared.",

            "selftext": "This is a long post which is also my first post. \nThis has been bothering me for a couple years now.\n\nIt all started in my early high school days. We were young and probably didn't know what we were doing. \n\nIt started with me seeing a girl I liked and taking a chance. We became best friends and then one afternoon she confessed her love for me. I was shocked myself. The next day I told her the same thing and that's how it started. We were official. For about a year everything was perfect and we both enjoyed every second of it. We would see each other every school day and be with each other for 45 minutes each day. We very rarely hung out after school because she had strict parents. Now, I was a fairly popular person in high school and she wasn't. She had about 4 friends while I knew and talked to a lot of people. I guess I was a very flirty guy and I didn't even realize it. I was really close to a girl in one of my classes and I guess her friend told her about it and made me \"chill.\" She finally had enough after that girl and another girl asked me out in the same month. She made it to where I barely talked to any other girls about anything anymore. I didn't know really care much as long as she was happy. I guess I did that a lot. Doing what she wanted to make her happy. However I started getting insecure when she would talk to guys and I did the same thing to her about talking to guys. I didn't know think it was wrong because she did it to me but it was. But the relationship went on. After that first year things began to change. We started to argue and get mad at each other a lot. One day she really made me mad and made a mistake and said something I shouldn't have. I regretted it instantly. After that day in any argument that would come up. I never liked arguing so I always tried to stop it by just listening to what she had to say until she stopped. She would say some bad things about me sometimes and would always end up crying afterwards. After most of the arguments we would apologize to each other and move on. We tried to fix this whole thing and it started working for a while again. We both removed the stupid no talking to opposite gender rule ever though we didn't like it. I'm not to sure why but the relationship just wasn't working again around the ending of the second year. We would argue and I just did my thing again by letting her talk because I didn't want to saying anything I would regret. I started to feel like I was a disappointment. Like I wasn't enough for her. I got pretty . She tried to make me feel better and after while I did. I heard from a lot of people that she was talking to some guy in her math class and I didn't really care because in my head nothing would happen. 5 months later she was telling at me and I said something and she punched me in the face. It wasn't a hard punch but I was still shocked. She had never done anything like that before. She realized what she did and started crying. I tried to tell her it's okay to get her to stop.  The next day she comes to me with I can't be with you anymore because \"I\" made her cry too much. I was so mad and sad I just walked away. I hadn't cried in about 3 years but that day some tears came out. I didn't say this earlier but she would always say things like yeah we'll be together forever and stuff. I should've known it wasn't true. She tried to text me for a couple weeks after that but I was so mixed I just yelled or ignored her. Eventually she had enough trying and told me to forget it and her and lots more. I eventually forgave her until I saw she was with another guy not even a week after. I talked to her and she actually hugged and kissed me even though she was in a relationship already. I asked her about that and she said if we were meant to be I'll see you in the future. But I cut her off from my life completely. I went into a deep  and cut off a lot of people. I didn't know who I was and who were my friends. I lost trust in everyone. Eventually I found friends who love and care about me. This bothers me still because every time I would see her I would remember it all and I always say it's my fault and I hate myself. I still think about where it all went wrong. My friends tell me we hung out too much but I'm not sure. I've never told anyone the full or even half of the story. Since then I haven't been the same. I became antisocial and shy when I used to be very outgoing. I still have trust issues and haven't been in another relationship since. I am also awkward now which I hate. I sometimes wish none of it happened but I did enjoy our first year together and that I don't regret. \n\nTo those of you that read this whole thing feel free to comment or msg me if you want to talk.

            "selftext": "I'll start by saying this: I've never had a very close relationship with most of my family members. For whatever reasons, my immediate family (mom, dad, brother) just never really kept in contact with many of our family members and it has also been vice versa. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, let's get to the \"good stuff. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am 30 years old and I have still been living with my parents. Yes, I know this is a problem and yes, I am doing everything I can to change it. My brother has a history of being very mean, aggressive and verbally abusive and even has sometimes gotten violent towards my mom and dad and I. We have lived with this for years and all the while he has gotten the same treatment/opportunities that I have gotten and I have never acted in these ways or acted entitled, like he does. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEarlier this year, in January, my mom suddenly had a heart attack while out sight seeing with my dad and ended up in the hospital in a coma for a week before she passed away. This has undoubtedly changed my life and left me with emotional scars. The last time I ever talked to my mother she was laying in a hospital bed unable to respond and I was breaking down in tears....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward a bit and we have family over at our house and many family members that we haven't spoken to in years, for various reasons. They visit for awhile and we have various other visitors who pay their respects and eventually my dad and I return to our \"normal\" life (my brother is living on his own with his girlfriend). We continue this way for a few months and visit one of my Aunts, on my dad's side, every weekend. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy Aunt is one of those family members that hasn't been in our lives in years. She abandoned us and shunned us for many, many years because we do not believe the way she does and did not go to the same church as her. She's a \"Christian\". Anyway, we have been speaking again since her church basically black listed her and shunned her, coming full circle for how she treated us. Karma in action, if you will. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomething that happened before my mom died is I ended up being hospitalized for hearing voices and seeing visions. I was in there for almost 2 weeks. I even lost my job because of it. I got out and returned to pretty much normal before all of this happened and my mom died, etc. I even got another job. But, once my mom died, dad quickly found a new girlfriend in the form of a woman he had dated before he and my mom met. There's even the story that mom caught him talking to her once around 10 years or so ago and claimed that he had been cheating. They had talked about divorcing but never did, ultimately. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn less than 2 months after my mom died, my dad is with this woman again. I find this a little suspicious and it makes me question whether he truly cared about my mom. That's a little quick to find someone for not having been talking to them already. Fast forward a little, and I'm visiting my aunt again one weekend, with my dad, and they end up taking me to the hospital and admitting me AGAIN just because I was \"acting weird\". They did this against my will. I did not give them permission to do so. So guess what happens?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI lose my job AGAIN and I have another week and a half stay in the hospital, wondering why I'm in there. On the DAY i get released from the hospital, my dad proclaims to me that we're moving in with my Aunt in 2 weeks. I ask him how long he had been thinking about it and he said that he had been thinking about it on and off for a month... BUT WAITS TO TELL ME ON THE DAY I GET RELEASED FROM A STRESSFUL HOSPITAL STAY....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, 2 weeks pass and we move in with my Aunt. He stays here with us for all of 2 weeks before moving in with his girlfriend, which is where he currently resides. My dad SCREWED me by doing what he did. My plan was to get my old job back, the one I had before i was hospitalized the first time, and get my own place. Then mom died. He claimed that we would stick together but in reality he went for what he wanted (his new girlfriend) and said \"Fuck you, son, fend for yourself\". He did not state this explicitly, but his actions spoke for themselves. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, here I am living with my aunt, dealing with the  and the emotional trauma of losing my mom. The awkwardness of seeing him and his girlfriend interact with each other and flirt on Facebook. I'm also losing all the money that I had saved up for myself from not working and to add to that I'm expected to pay roughly $400 a month rent to my Aunt. My only income, for the foreseeable future, will be unemployment benefits. I'm at a low point for sure and I'm now with left with some tough questions about my mom and dad's relationship and also of who I can truly trust now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I'm saying this to give some background and insight on what I'm really making this post about....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mentioned that my brother has a mean spirited, aggressive and sometimes violent history. Well, I spoke to him recently about how awkward it is for me to be around dad and his new girlfriend and vented a little. My brother, being the mean spirited asshole that he is, told me that he had been planning on \"letting dad have it\" for awhile now, anyway. So, he goes and sends my dad many text messages blessing him out and calling him all sorts of mean, nasty things and accusing him of never being a good father and also calls his girlfriend a \"whore\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI go on after my brother tells me that he \"let dad have it\" and just go about living my life and I think nothing else of it. It would do me no good to get involved and try to get mad and argue with my brother over what he did. After all, it was directed at my dad and he should be the one to handle [it](https://it.Dad). Dad has enabled my brother's entitled behavior for years and never stood up to him and practiced tough love with him so dad essentially allowed mom and I to endure many, many hardships and emotional trauma. For example, my brother would often call my mom a \"bitch\" and hold his fists up at her as if her wanted to hit her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen the trouble starts. Dad vents to my Aunt that my brother blessed him out and that's how she finds out that I said something to my brother about my dad and his girlfriend being over here, visiting us. She accuses me of \"stirring the shit\" and blames me for my brother going off on my dad the way he did and calling \"her friend a whore\". She then goes on to say that she doesn't want my brother showing up at her doorstep, implying that because I'm talking to him that he would show up here and cause trouble. She also goes on to say that she doesn't want anything but peace in her house, again implying that what transpired somehow took place in her house, which I live in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I stood up for myself, she started naming off other people I could go live with and then made it a point to mention that my uncle wouldn't take me in. She even said that if I need to be right, then it's ok I can be right. Very ironically, for someone who wants peace in her house and doesn't want the \"shit stirred\" she seems to have a unique way of both \"stirring the shit\" and breaking the peace. Her logic is so far skewed that she actually believed that her argument was valid. She actually believes that it is my fault that my brother went off on my dad, like he did and that it's my fault that he also called his girlfriend a \"whore\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn reality, she's just starting to get a taste of what my dad and I have endured for years with my brother and she doesn't know how to handle it. What she really did, by blaming me for my brother's actions, is what my dad has done for years... and that is, she excused his actions as if they wouldn't have happened without me speaking to him and completely cleared him of responsibility for them. I do believe that she is genuinely afraid of what my brother might do if he were to show up here. In an odd and very eye opening way, maybe that needs to happen so she can have a better idea of who to blame next time the \"shit gets stirred\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm posting all of this to get it off my chest and to vent. I am very angry with her for even acting like she can judge the situation in the way that she is and for blaming me, when it was clearly not my fault. She was out of our lives for many years for her judgmental and \"holier than thou\" attitude. Now, she's back in our lives and wants to assess a stake in a situation that she has no stake in. She's already found out what happens when you confront me with drama and petty schoolyard bullshit that is completely uncalled for and she was both shocked and surprised. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's funny, she's over 50 years old and still a drama queen. Just another example that proves age doesn't determine your maturity level. She still worries about who says what about her and even contemplates and assumes what people might think about her or certain situations. Sad, really. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy plan is to get my old job back still and get my own place. After that, I am feeling strongly that I need to cut ties with her and go back to the way things were, no communication between us. She seems to be the type to start drama and I no longer feel comfortable living her and especially talking to her about family matters. Not only her but my uncle and even my cousin, who is too young to even fully understand what is going on. I even feel that it would be beneficial to keep communication with my dad to a minimum and also cut ties with everyone else on his side of the family since I don't exactly have good vibes from them, either. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo anyone who has read this far, I thank you for paying attention and welcome any and all comments. What do you think? Would you cut ties too, if you had been put through these situations?",

Met a great guy, we talked a lot, met up he was great. A few dates in he decides hes not into it anymore, so bye non existent confidence. We remained friends, so its good. Then who I thought was my closest friend just up and told me that I text them too much, which is only a few text a day. That fucked me up good, when the person you believe to be your bff tells you that, I mean we've been friends for years. Work is depresing af, life is  af, idk what to do. At this point I feel like im never gonna find anybody, friend or SO. I just want somebody to be excited about talking to me, about seeing me. Wanting to spend time with me or even just talk. I feel like im going nowhere and idk what to do about it. \n\nSo yeah,  af. At this point I\u2019d pay a shink to talk to me.",

            "selftext": "I\u2019m transgender, and I\u2019ve been bullied my entire life. I didn\u2019t get bullied about being trans or get until I cut all my hair off and started socially transitioning in the beginning of tenth grade. I didn\u2019t even last a nine week quarter before having a full on panic attack. I couldn\u2019t go back to that school. Whenever I think about what I went through I still get a pit in my stomach and feel like I want to cry. I transferred out, and stayed home for two years while I just gained more weight and hid in my room. Not binding at home to let my chest breathe which hurt me more. Having not many friends. My  and anxiety got even worse. And I to multiple times did try and take my own life. I had no happiness. I made a wildly stupid decision to go back to public school, which lead to sexual harassment, friends abandoning me due to pneumonia, and teachers not respecting me enough to call me my name and pronouns when I wasn\u2019t there. I have a couple friends are cool, and that I really like. I haven\u2019t found my perfect soul mate, and I still struggle deeply with what\u2019s happened. I struggle with friends. I apologize all the time. My emotions are all over the place all the time and I\u2019m very sensitive. Thinking about school gives me a whole ball of anxiety that envelops me inside. I\u2019m 18, and I\u2019m still struggling. I still haven\u2019t felt very much in a while, but I try and act like it. Fake it tell you make it. \n\nI really want a soul mate. Someone who understands me. Someone who loves me for who I am. For my rolls, my scars, my gender identity, my , my anxiety, just for everything I am. But I don\u2019t know if I can ever have that. I lost my first girlfriend cause I\u2019m gay. My second boyfriend ghosted me for months before dumping me and ghosting me again. My third boyfriend manipulated me into a relationship with him. And my last boyfriend scared me by moving things way to fast. I\u2019m terrified of dating again. \n\nI just graduated. I turned 18 this year. And this year has been filled with nothing but issue after issue. I got into a horrible car crash I could have died in, loosing my first car. I got pneumiona twice in one month only to be diagnosed with allergy induced asthma. My friends dumped me because I couldn\u2019t text them when I had pneumonia. I was sexually harassed for using the bathroom. I had to basically give up my final semester due to my health issues. I learned about what other kids were saying behind my back because I\u2019m trans. I learned my teacher never really respected me. And on my last day of seiner year my dog died. \n\nI feel awful. I thought I was okay but I\u2019m really not. I just feel like a whiny kid who\u2019s not getting his way. But I really don\u2019t feel okay. I tried to kill myself before prom, something that\u2019s supposed to make you so happy. I was alone at prom. My fiends all had dates. And I had absolutely no one. I stood off to the side the whole time only occasionally dancing. I even left early cause I felt so awkward. \n\nI should be okay. I\u2019m in therapy and I\u2019ve left school. I\u2019m starting collage soon. But I\u2019m really not. I seriously haven\u2019t felt anything but sadness and numbness for so long. \n\nWhy can\u2019t I just be okay.",

            "selftext": "I feel like making this account and using it as a source to express how I feel at the moment would be a good idea so I\u2019m a guy I\u2019m 20 (hi lol) I graduated high school about 2 years ago and I completely cut myself off from almost about everyone I knew at the time and still a little to this day see it as me \u201cbranching off on my own and finding a better group of people to be around\u201d and I\u2019ve honestly always wished for that to happen sometimes towards the end of high school I sort of just cut loose and ran. I don\u2019t know if anyone has anything similar but that goes into my second part.\n\nCurrently I\u2019m still living in the same town still with my family and although they are supportive and loving as ever I also have my older sister here I know they would be happier if I were to move out and start my own life (something I think a lot of parents would want for their child) but I recently made the mistake of dropping out of college, I was going to a nice community college a little bit out of town from where I am now (just to open myself up to fresh faces and in a weird way reinvent myself) but as time went on and I of course started working I just snapped and completely shut off from everything now I did go through a heavy (I would say)  episode which I really don\u2019t want to go on here right now or I\u2019ll be here forever. So ever since I dropped out of college I\u2019ve of course have a job (which is great because I at least feel like me having money and helping my parents out is a huge part as to why I\u2019m still here) but it\u2019s a very mundane job and I do plan on leaving once I find something better possibly in the next few months.  \n\nThe one good thing that came out of my \\u201d episode......(and I mean that in the lightest way I\u2019ve never been diagnosed and I do have family members who have gone through it so I don\u2019t mean to piss off people who deal with actual  because that shits rough and I really don\u2019t mean to offend anybody but that was the darkest time of my life and I still feel like I\u2019m facing the tail end of that and I don\u2019t know any other way to describe it).....was that I did find something that I am really passionate about or at-least think is a great direction for me and that has to do with art not necessarily physical art but more so graphic and animations etc (I really don\u2019t want to say much because I want to say as anonymous as I can for now)\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nSo that\u2019s that\n\nSo.. that was a shit ton\nI\u2019m just going to simplify it into main points if anyone wasn\u2019t  able to read through that if they can (I wouldn\u2019t blame you if you can\u2019t i sound very woe is me right now and I might regret this later )\n\n\u2022How do I push myself out there to be more sociable again, I\u2019ve always been the \u201cfriend of\u201d or \u201c so and so\u2019s friend\u201d I want to create an identity for myself with a whole new group of people it\u2019s gotten to a point where I can talk to someone but it\u2019s sort of obvious I\u2019m forcing myself to the point where I am either stuttering over my words or will just sit in complete silence if I don\u2019t know what to say\n\n\u2022How do I find a good group of people to surround myself with and actually feel like I am worth something to them? (yikes I know that last part is a doozy and takes some internal shit I know)\n\n\u2022How do I stop reliving all the cringe-y or embarrassing things I\u2019ve done in the past when they were well over 2 (almost 3) years ago and I am a completely different person\n\n\u2022And lastly and I hope this doesn\u2019t turn this whole post into a joke but I really need advice on this, how do I word a financial aid reinstatement letter in my case like I see all of these examples where they have valid reasons  a death in a family a accident but I don\u2019t have any of those. I just snapped I shut down completely and just fell into a hole that I can\u2019t seem to get out of.\n\nSo there it is this honestly just scratches the surface and I chose to gloss over a lot of stuff but if this does get some sort of response I will definitely try to talk about those issues and other things in depth. I really don\u2019t want people to think I\u2019m some \u201csad boi\u201d I love having discussions and love debating topics with people I love art and music and history and just so many things I\u2019d love to use this reddit account as a way to show some of that stuff  and maybe make a few reddit buds but yeah \n\nP.S I do want to cover a few quick things I might possibly get in response \n\n1.) I don\u2019t feel comfortable talking to my parents this deeply about stuff when it comes to this situation they are hard working people and are dealing with a lot when it comes to other family issues and I absolutely do not want to let them in on this as this time not only that it\u2019s super uncomfortable for me to do so since I\u2019ve never been this open to anyone ever\n\n2.) A therapist is something I\u2019d likely do in the future but for now I\u2019d like to do a little self reflection and sort myself out a bit more\n\nP.S.S I\u2019m a very self analyzing person so I\u2019ve had a lot of time to think about this and it\u2019s something I do on a constant basis \n\nI don\u2019t want this to be one big sad post I\u2019m actually very hesitant but happy I\u2019m posting this for the slight chance someone might see this and we could connect I don\u2019t want to be compared to anyone else\u2019s problems because I know there are others dealing with way worse but yeah yikes this is getting long !! \n\nIf you read through this completely you\u2019re a trooper!\n\n\n\n(^_\u2212)\u2212\u2606",

Anger Issues has been a thing within my family through genes where they love blaming on each other over small little things. My dad In particular has the genes of my grandmother who's fairly strict and very narrow-minded as well as being easily mad at everything. (Even an innocent small question would get her angry. They are both religious.)\n\nBoth my grandmother and my dad are old fashioned and has been for years, never did try to change a thing about themselves. I was fine with them being strict with me but as I grew older, I felt like I was too controlled by them. Every time my dad invites me to go out with my granny, he would manipulate me into and sometimes even gaslight me thinking that I didn't love him or I set my priorities wrongly. I was forced to go to anywhere he'd like. I'm mentally weak and will always give In but this year, I've genuinely had enough of his mind games. I'd get angry when he tries to do the same thing for years again but this time, \n\nI felt like killing him as my anger boils.\n\nI know It's a toxic mindset and it's mentally ill of me to think that way of my own parent. I, myself am  and has been for years trying to recover without . My emotions can get out of control and I'm scared I might act out my feelings someday. I've told my dad about how I have  when I was younger but he would scoffed. None In my family knew what Is  or any other mental illness. They don't show emotions. Even If they do, It was never positive. I wish I could be free like my big brother. He was never scolded by what I wanted to wear; like a dress. Although it's quite long, it was still inappropriate In his POV and he'd give me attitude for the rest of the day. \n\nI just wish I could run away from home but I know I have no friends nor enough money to live by myself. I'm jobless, although I'm still young but It still takes a huge impact. Especially when your dad Is suppose to teach you adulthood but mine never does and I would get scolded for not trying harder by my grandmother. My grades weren't enough to get a better and easier jobs either. I want to be free like my big brother. I want to get the love he has from my parents too but even as a child, It was never received. Just once, I want my parents to be proud of me. \n\nI wish they'd realized I'm suffering mentally but I know it will never happen and someday I'm forced to cut them off my contacts list.",

            "selftext": "Growing up, i've experienced a lot of things that are probably quite massive when it comes to mental-development.\n\nI used to be this highly-active, very expressive, and also imaginative kid who likes to spend her time imagining things and turning it out to something. I loved to draw things, doing craft, singing, and most of all, storytelling. But also, on the other hand, i had this \"introvert-sign\" thingy. I used to avoid any loud environment or attending a family gathering. My mom said that those things bothered me as a kid. \n\nBut i do remember back then in pre-school, i was a very sociable person. I can get along with people easily. People loved it when it comes to me storytelling stuff. \n\nThen, primary school. I was the same person, but the environment it gave me kinda pushed me to be quite monotone.\n\nI went to a school which was located in a military-neighborhood. And the teacher were like, prioritizing my friend who were like, so beautiful, sweet, and ofc she's a daughter of a military person. The teacher didn't get along with me just because i answered the question wrong. And i have no idea why those kind of things really triggers me to punish myself. This happened when i was in a 3rd grade. I was like, \"maybe it's better for me to not learn anything since i won't be appreciated\". Of course i did good, but it was not enough. I wasn't in the top 10. Typical asian school requires you to have good grades for everything. That stressed me out cause i loved to do something creative. I was very confident but also shy at the same time. This thing kinda built me to become a person who hates criticism, who's afraid of what people think about me. And that's bad, i know.\n\nI moved to another city when i was in 4th grade. This city feels way more peaceful. Even though the traffic is really bad. But the new school felt different. That's when i know, i really enjoy new environment. I got along easily. I blended in easily. Everything was perfect. I got really good grades, being in the top 3 for 3 years straight. Got everyone accepted me, respected me, and had a lot of amazing friends. I expressed myself really good. I enjoyed writing stories and harmonizing songs. Drawing also one of my passions. I could draw with either one of my hands. And i think that's amazing.\n\nEntering the secondary school. My country relies on public school. It has been told that public has way more advantages than private. But in my city, the private seems to have a lot of great facilities and diverse curriculum. Since because i moved from another city and my parents hadn't change our certificate or those type of thing, i couldn't get into any public school here. My gpa supposedly eligible but i couldnt just because of my certificate. So i had to enter this private school. It has an A-accreditation, supposedly it was good. But turns out, my grades were higher than most students there. I was a very excellent student. But the environment it gave me didn't maximize my potential. Didn't even give me any guidance on how to manage my interests. So my grades were dropping. I even got a boyfriend back then but he was very jealous of my capabilities which made him destroying me mentally for around a year. Till i graduated with a decent gpa, and a broken soul. Of course i broke up with him soon after.\n\nSo i decided to go back to my hometown and registered for a public school there. My hometown has districts. And it sorts the students by it's closest way to their houses. So i got to enter the eastern part (cause it was close) and again, i got into a school which was located in between police and military area. I was skeptical at first, but i was hoping i could gain more friends and experiences.\n\nTurns out, everyone there was different. The teachers were kinda stressing me out. The attitude of the excellent students there really stressed me out. I had a dream to enter one of my country's prestigious uni, and this student were like, crushing my dream. He was skeptical of me, and etc. Also i didn't know why i was such a rebel in high school. I was a good person, still. But my attitude is way worse. I hated the school, hated the people, i didn't even reach anything good. My grades were fair. Didn't even get any prize. Couldn't get along with people. I just have no idea why. I did great outside school. I hated it when my school tryna act like they're prestigious enough but inside, they're just as dirty as the other one. My 3 years were wasted for doing nothing. And i can tell my capabilities were dropped into a significant amount. Till i don't even recognize who i am anymore.\n\nI know there's something wrong with me. But deep inside, i always think that i'm not special. Who i am right now is what everyone sees. No hope in gaining all my crushed dreams and full capabilities. I lost my energy on everything. It sucks and hurts at the same time. \n\nI still love this \"storytelling-soul\" but right now, i'm feeling alone. Literally like, have no one to actually talk. Anxiety, , loneliness, all sorts of things have been bugging me out. One thing that keeps me holding myself onto this is the fact that people thinking this is just a phase, or maybe it's just my growth hormone, or etc. But i'm feeling like i need help. \n\nI'm really sad.",

When home alone, I will obsessively masturbate or constantly watch some anime scenes where someone is screaming in rage -- giving all my best to also feel the rage. I will watch such single scenes over 30 times (and this number is likely much lower than the actual one). While watching, I will quench my teeth, exercise obsessively, and walk around my apartment like a maniac. I have been doing all of this for over 10 years now.\n\nWhy I do these things? It makes me feel alive and enables me to actually do things I want to do in between the weird \"sessions\" of mine. Without all of this, I become a sack of meat and will just feel deep emptiness within me. Everything will seem boring and I will only play games to distract myself from that uncomfortable feeling.\n\nNow, for over 2 years, I am suspecting to have ADHD (and some kind of weird ). I also developed anxiety issues 3-4 years ago. Heart palpitations also came along. When I tell anyone these problems, they believe I am exaggerating. They would gaslight me and tell me that I am imagining everything and that I should just snap out of it. Now that I have finally somehow finished my university and got a job at one of the top 5 software companies, I am also able to visit a psychologist. After hearing all I said to him and having conducted hours of interviews and tests, he is strongly convinced that I have adhd, , and anxiety. FINALLY, someone.....

            "selftext": "TL;DR : ~21M USA. I worry about everything, have severe , am scared of being poor my entire life because I'm not intelligent enough, and scared of the future plans (marriage, kids, etc) because of climate change and the world changing. I feel hopeless, sometimes suicidal, and would like advice. \n\nI'm 20 years old, turning 21 in September. I was raised and still live poor. I have been stressed day in and day out with very few breaks since middle school. From worrying about war, climate change, how to achieve my goals, my relationship, to my health and all the things that a lot of people worry about.\n\nI was diagnosed with severe  towards the end of March this year. I spent most of my spring semester in my dorm, only leaving to eat or go back home. I never went to class. This bothered me, but I had been contemplating suicide for some time so it didn't bother me enough for me to change.\n\nI was forced into therapy by my RA when a friend of mine mentioned that I had rarely shown up for class. The RA came to my dorm and woke me by banging on my door. I had been sleeping for a maximum of five hours per day, sometimes staying awake for over 24 hours at a time.\n\nTherapy was nice, but besides feeling like I was in good hands, the therapy did nothing except provide temporary relief. I had a one hour session every week, and I would walk out of the sessions feeling better. It didn't take long for that feeling to wear off. Therapy was nice, but it only confirmed that I was  and not making it up in my head while trying to deny it.\n\nI received a medical leave from the university and I moved back home.\n\nI have not had therapy since mid April and I haven't been able to deal with my symptoms on my own. I have gained almost 50lbs and eat compulsively because it makes me happy for a while.\n\nI have come to terms with myself and realize that I have a bad relationship with food.\n\nI enjoy spending time with my small group of friends, but, like food or therapy, the boost in happiness is temporary and being there for too long diminishes the effects. Once I leave my friends, I am usually unhappy or feeling low before I leave their neighborhood.\n\nThrough all of this, I have always had a passion for creating music. In fact, it is what I was studying at my university. But, I have not written much and I have not felt the same fire in my chest as I did before college. I do not feel any drive. I have spent almost half of my life writing music, learning instruments, exploring and experiencing music, but I have basically nothing to show for it. \n\nI have never had a job despite applying to a couple dozen positions I qualify or almost qualify for around my town and two other neighboring cities. I must be doing something wrong.\n\nI feel like despite being alive for this long, I have done nothing with my life that I am proud of or is worth while.\n\nWhat advice would you give somebody who feels lost and hopeless? I feel like the rest of my life will either be the same or slightly better because I lack the skills or competence to go into a field of work that pays more than tips or minimum wage, and I don't see the point in living if that's the case. I will not raise a family on minimum wage and I don't know if I even want kids anymore because of how the world is changing. I can't even say for sure that I want to marry anybody in the future.\n\nI have a girlfriend, we've been together for almost three years, but she has her own problems and mental health issues. Neither of us have been in a relationship for this long and both of us have been determined to stick together for as long as possible. She's my best friend, and who I thought I might marry and have a family with, but I can't say for certain I want to do either of those anymore.\n\nAdvice please. Links, resources, wisdom, anything. I need help.",

For example, three days ago, I cut contact with a girl I used to like a lot and was talking to for months (she explicit said that had feelings for me as well). Two days later, she found a way to contact me and asked me why I ghost her and told me she was daiting another guy. I replied and said \"ok, have the time of your life\". Funny thing is, I used to be a very sensitive person and deeply affected by things like that, among many others. I can't precisely recall how I became this way, which is very odd. What happened that I can't remember? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSincerely, I don't think it's the , cause overall I am pretty happy with my life right now, don't feel numb, none of that. Actually, I'm pretty active and very inspired most of time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, that's it. I could tell more but I don't feel comfortable sharing so much. I've been through a lot of worse situations, but don't feel like sharing now. Maybe, someday... sorry for venting\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: I'm from South America. So excuse me if there's any misspellings\n\nNote 2: In 2016, I remember being overly sensitive and I feel kinda frustrated because I don't really know why and how I changed",
