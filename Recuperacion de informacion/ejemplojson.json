            "selftext": "Let me preface this by saying it's mostly a rant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAround this time last year, my depression got extremely bad for a multitude of reasons I won't go into, unfortunately mostly self inflicted (self isolating, poor sleep schedule, never leaving my dorm, and just constantly, constantly having an internal smackdown of anything I felt good about). I self-harmed for the first time last year, and the second I did it, I regretted it and pulled myself out and tried to make an effort to do better, and it worked. I started reaching out to friends I had pushed away, talked to my family members more, and focused on my art and getting my shit together post-college.\n\nIt worked for awhile.\n\nAnd yet these past two months have been hell; my college is extremely work intensive, and while I love art, it's so hard to not feel burned out. I'm  tired all the time, and I'm even more irritable than normal. I self-isolated again, and all I can think of is just how fucking tired I am of always being the instigator with ANY of my friends; even my friends. No one talks to me first unless they need something from me. I'm not on good terms with either of my parents, and while I am close with my siblings, both are busy and in happy/healthy parts of their lives. My brother often tells me I'm a \"horrible person\" and I'm so fucking tired of it. Half the time I send messages to friends, I get blown off or ignored, unless I double/triple text them. I thought I was recovering but I'm just over stressed, and I have so little of a support system that it feels like if I killed myself, it'd just be like \"Oh that's unfortunate, anyway what's for dinner?\" And it probably would.\n\nI'm tired; my art is my only thing I take pride in, but it's so fucking hard to stay positive when all of it doesn't look as good as I wish it did. It looks bad; I feel bad, but I have to keep going because I'm in college and if I lose my scholarship, then I might as well kill myself because my parent made it very clear if I don't finish my degree, I'm getting disowned. \n\nThis past weekend was hard; a college event went terribly and I feel even *more* terrible at my capabilities. I tried to call my dad and talk to him about it, and he blew me off and told me he had to make dinner and he'd call me on Sunday. He didn't. I keep getting blown off by friends, and i just feel like a fly buzzing around people's ears. I wish I'd be fucking squashed.\n\nMy suicidal thoughts are so passive and casual; constantly wanting to jump in front of a bus or just stab/shoot myself or something, but I'm a coward and can't do it. Logically I know this will pass, but god fucking damn it it's so hard because I don't even want to finish college at this point because what the fuck else am I going to do?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: If there were an instant death button, I'd fucking smash it.",

Nobody wants to hang out with the guy who can't drink and can't work so he's always broke. I don't have an old car anymore so the old car guys don't talk to me anymore, I don't do graphic design anymore because I kept getting screwed and it stressed me out so bad that I just can't so my design friends don't talk to me. I only hear from my \"friends\" when they need something, never otherwise. I do things for people hoping to get on their good side or stay on their good side but it only ever gets me a slap in the face....metaphorically. My best friend is dead and gone, the last guy I considered a best friend called me a child when I was in the middle of a mental breakdown and hasn't talked to me sense... I hear he made an example of me on his Facebook page... Classy... People wonder why I'm always so mean and cranky and I'll happily tell them. I'm tired of being used and walked all over without so much as a thank you for making a fucking flier or helping someone move, or dropping everything to come help someone with something.... The last time someone came to our house was because they were picking something up I donated to their family. My \"friends\" flake on promises, purposely exclude My Girlfriend and I because we don't have kids, avoid talking to me when I need help.... I'm just over it. I sit at home every single day by myself wondering if today will be the day I step out in front of traffic because I just can't take anymore being alone. I don't want \"I'm sorry\" I don't want \"Hey we should go grab coffee/lunch/food sometime\" I don't want your sympathy field trips or party invites...It's too late for that bullshit, I know it's all fake and out of sympathy because I post shit like this.... I honestly just want my old life back. I miss my job, I miss being around people, I miss being happy to wake up in the morning. I miss being able to go out and hop in my simple old 62 Falcon and just drive around without a care in the world....till it broke down again.\n\nMy girlfriend always says she misses the old me and so do I, but when you feel like you're being walked all over, you're constantly let down and nobody wants anything to do with you unless you have something for them.... It's hard to be the old you. I have three people I know I can always depend on and one of them lives with me and isn't home or awake for about 20 hours of the day and the other works all the time in the bay area and the other lives in Texas but still makes a point of being there if I need anything.... Not like some of the locals.. . Everyone else is just here to see what the monkey will do for his next trick... Probably swallow all of my heart pills and go for a run honestly. I'm over it.",

I was hoping I could just be the black sheep of the family and he would be the healthy well adjusted son my parents could be proud of, but now it seems he's starting to follow in my footsteps.

            "selftext": "\n\n\n\nI feel horrible to write this here, but I really don't know where else to do it.\nthis is quite literally my first day on reddit with an actual account here on reddit.\n\nTo make things clear and give no wrong impression as I go on, I am not suicidal, nor am I dealing with self harm issues. I never cut myself or did anything in that direction, nor do I ever intend to do so. That's why I genuinely feel really bad for posting this here. If someone has another sub which fits more, I'll gladly post it there!\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nAfter reading what I wrote I realized that I gave way too much backstory and vented quite a bit. And since it involves sexual and emotional abuse to some degree I thought putting a trigger warning here might be the right thing.\n\n\nWith that beeing said:\n\nI was raped twice in my life. Once with 12 and once with 15.\nOne of them was a Stalker who did stalk me for 3 years (according to him. I really can't tell if that is true, since I never saw him before) and the second time it was my uncle when I had to live with him for two weeks.\ni was always timid and shy, but after the first incident it got a lot worse, going as far as to tear up whenever someone who wasn't my dad, brother or one of their best friends (which I both I knew all my life and trust unconditionaly), even just touched my shoulder.\nafter the 2 weeks living with my uncle and going through pure horror, it became much worse. \n\nas you can guess, timid and shy already, I isolated myself much more. I wasn't the most popular girl. There was bullying here and there, but when the story about my rape incident came out the second time (the first time it \"leaked\" because of police investigations at school while searching for the stalker, but up to this day I really can't say you how they got the information about my uncle a year after the incident) it got much worse.\nsome started making fun of the fact that it hapenned to me. \"Lennister-Jokes\" became pretty common and it went on for quite a while.\n\n\n\nOf course this doesn't mean that everybody bullied me. It was just a small minority, but the people who would be friendly to me and start talking to me either stopped doing that because they got sucked up into the bullying while doing so or simply because I have no real social skills in person and tend to be paralized, since I fear I would upset them or say something stupid. I don't consider myself to be not attractive and think I have an appealing appearance,  but even hearing a compliment from someone just makes me think at the spot that it is just a setup for a followup and an insult or some kind of other hurtful comment. And same goes for everything else, I always feel like whenever says something nice to me, some mean follow up will show up and hurt me.\n\n\nNow the problem is that while I told my family about the two incidents, I never did about about the bullying and especially how it got worse, at least Iplayed it always down as some minor mean comments about small things (having the courage to tell my family what my Uncle did, did lead to my mom breaking down, starting crying and hugging me almost for two hours and saying again and again that she was sorry she didn't notice it. No matter how often I said to her that I did not think for a second that she had any reason to apologize. My brother and dad enraged and were almost heading out to probably find and beat my uncle up. I had to beg them quite a while to calm them down again)\n\n\nAnd here lies my problem, the bullying itself didn't get worse, at least not much worse than usual.\nBut some guys are spreading informations about me. My name, my contacts. At the same time they actively ask people to \"insult, humiliate and hurt me\" and, which is the one that pains me the most and made me write this, that even my parents won't ever love me and that no matter  what they say, they think of me as a bother, as an insecure and fear crippled daughter who just drags them down. That they only endure me since they feel obligated as parents do so.\n\nMany write really supportive messages and most people are really supportive, some let out their frustration about the people who send them my contacts and just come by to warn me or leave a encouraging message. I am truly greatful for those people and them not taking advantage of my situation.\nI really don't want to act as a misanthrope, quite the opposite, I am really optimistic and think that at their core, most people are kind and goof hearted.\n\nBut there are also those others, especially those who mention my parents. Who start of writing me walls of text insulting me or writing tons of messages where they ask me specific questions about my rape.\nI delete them mostly, but I still see them to some degree.\nAnd it is killing me inside. I don't know what do about it. I know my parents love and support me, as does my big brother. I have such an amazing family and there is no place I feel safer or more loved when I get a hug from any of them or just a kiss on my cheeks.\nBut I also know that no matter how much they do, to some degree all those mean people are right. I am not easy to handle and a lot of work. I'm not throwing tantrums or insulting them. Not by any means. But I am filled with so many fears, insecurities and anxiety. I always need someone to lean on. A lot of their free time goes down with doing stuff with me like going out to the movies, going to the river, play video games or some other things, depending on who I spend time with of them. And it's not like I don't enjoy it. By no means, I love every second of it, even if it's just talking going out for a run with my big brother, helping my mum to clean the house or simply hugging and cuddling with my dad and listen to him telling me stories of his youth.\nI literally can't sleep on my own when I hear thunder without crawling into my parents or my brothers bed. and I'm 17, I should be past that point a long time ago, and despite knowing they love me, I know that I suck up so much of their own free time.\n\n\nI try my best and I really do progress, step by step.\nBut after changing my phone number for three times, these messages keep coming... and I can't just bring it up to tell my parents. To make my mom sad again or see  how my dad and my brother want to protect me.\nWhile my dad  would get angry at those who did it I know he would still stay calm, take me in his arms and try to comfort me while thinking of a solution for everything.\n\nMy brother on the other hand... he's got a very short temper, especially when it comes to protecting me (not as in that he ever physically abused me or is opressing me in my freedom. Quite the opposite, he always encourages me to get out of the house, get out of my comfort zone  and to try things out and develop as an individual) and I am genuinely afraid that he and his  best friend would just run straight to my school and probably beat up quite literally everybody they even suspect in bullying me or spreading this stuff around about me. And I don't want either people to get hurt because of me nor do I want to risk that my brother or his best friend get arrested or some other legal issues because of me.\n\nI just don't know what to do. because telling it to the school would probably make things worse once thry find out. telling my parents or brother isn't an option either. I'm a burden and a handfull of work as I am already, I don't want to be even much of a bigger burden than I already am..\nand going to the police would not change anything either.\nthinking of walking into a police station and saying \"some people post informations about me on a completely anonymous site like omegle on como\npletely diffeent hours of the day without any pattern at all to backtrack them\" just feels... as if they would think that I'm just a dumb little girl...\n\nIt's probably one or a few from my school, but still, I jsve no idea who it might be.. And I may be paranoid, but I am so scared of this whole thing going viral and my name as a rapevictim gets spread. I am even really scared this post might get upvotes and might get pooular (If you still are reading this, I would be genuinely greatuful if you did NOT upvote this post... sorry for beeing so paranoid again..)\n\nto be honest, I'm so paranoid that I am even scared to some degree about posting all this here.\n\nI am really really sorry though.. I just wanted to make a short post and ask for advice, and most of what I did was venting in the end..\n\nI really hope this was the right place though... if not, I am really sorry.\nand... any advice would be appreciated. If someone actually did read up until this point, thank you so much! and again.\n\nAnd again, just to set it straight and not concern anybody: yes, I suffer from it quite a bit.\nBut I am not suicidal, not doing any self harm to myself and trying to go on and push forward while I make progress in small steps, even if I have also backfalls where I get too gloomy or isolate myself. But I'm determined to make it, so please don't worry about that!",

The only issue is I hate sixth form and I hate being at home so im just never happy or content with anything. My dad does nothing but drink beer, smoke cigarettes and watch tv when he's home from work. My mother is currently not working for medical reasons (bipolar I believe) and she's very abusive (only word to describe it). She irradiates negativity. She was always on my sisters back and one day she took it too far and screamed and screamed because my sister didn't do her dishes that very minute (my sister was busy with uni work) and it reached to the point where my sister screamed back at her and then they screamed at each other for about half an hour and my sister moved out that very day. All my mother does now is complain every day and when the slightest thing ticks her off she screams and threatens to sell the house. (My dad is either working when this happens or he just doesnt say anything). I'm a pretty chill person so, unlike my sister, I don't bark back so I just kinda have to leave and sulk for a bit but everytime I just meed her to shut the fuck up. She's so mentally abusive and I genuinely believe that I hate her.\nI have \"friends\" at school I guess but not really. My only real friend lives in another country so I just feel so lonely all the time and theres nowhere I can go.\nI'm supposed to be doing my a levels, I want to go to university in September and I am sick to death of my life, what am I supposed to do?\n",

The past 6 months have been terrible, I do nothing with my life. I lay in bed all day with no motivation to do anything. I sleep all the time, never want to leave, and tasks that involve leaving the house literally make me sick to my stomach sometimes. I\u2019ve never experienced anything like this in my entire life. I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s just getting used to a new life after high school or if I\u2019m genuinely depressed. I have a great life with amazing people in it and honestly no stressors other than classes. I want help but I don\u2019t know what to do because I don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m overreacting. I know I need help of some sort because I feel like I\u2019m spiraling. \n\n",

I\u2019m trying to find myself and be myself, yet at the same time I\u2019m expected to be bothered with school and everything. That is fine, I would\u2019ve been fine if it stayed in school, but I have to adhere my whole life to it and I just cannot do that, I deny to throw away life for an arbitrary system. It\u2019s hard to know that I probably would\u2019ve been content on my own, or at least I would\u2019ve had the opportunity to take the decision to end my life, but that\u2019s too hard right now. It\u2019s my philosophical opinion that I could very well live, but all this shit makes me doubt it. People live fortunate lives without giving the slightest care about deeper issues, but I cannot do that. I cannot not think and I prefer a conscious, mindful life even if it brings me sorrow at times. That is not the case however, i cannot live with only my thoughts, obviously. There is real life, which everyone is subject to, but I have no motivation, I have lost people whom I deeply loved, I have lost my own self, I\u2019m trying hard to heal and then improve myself, but at the same I\u2019m expected to deal with everything else, keeping a schedule, studying, making people happy. Everyone seems so intolerant of any other issues other than physical sickness, even my parents whom I\u2019ve held for thoughtful. It just really drains all life out of me to be treated so harshly when I\u2019m trying to find my will to live and trying to achieve myself, so to say. I take complete responsibility for getting myself out of this hell but I\u2019m getting constantly pushed down, as if my own unmotivatedness wasn\u2019t enough of an issue to overcome. As I\u2019m trying to solve my mental issues, everything else comes crushing and I fall again in this state of misery. \n\nThanks to everyone who took the time to read. As I\u2019ve said, I\u2019m not always all too grim but I find myself back in this state over and over again. Such is life, but I\u2019m pretty sure it must not necessarily be so, so I really needed to vent.\n\n",

I dont lay in Bed till noon (holidays atm) but get a bit productive even.\n\nWhen I am alone too much and couldn't come up with going outside, I tend to sit down on my computer and browse. Consume the stuff numbly, browing reddit and watch youtube. At times i tend to have an internal desire to browse other stuff i dislike and that makes me feel bad. Could be anything. \n\nMy mind dont want to, but i keep on going on auto pilot. My conciousness is then a just a tiny voice with no control (not actual voice, metaphorical)\n\nIts like some cutting i heared and saw others do. But mentally. \n\nWhen i fall for it, i manage to get clear for a few days, the bad memory fresh in mind. I am full of regret, trying to find ways to stop it from happening. Then it takes a few weeks and the old routine is back. \n\nI want to find a way to make this easier to prevent, since its nothing i want to. \n\nI know myself. Self put up restraints are easiely torn down.\n\nLately i managed to get my conciousness a bit more noisy. I know now what I do, but i can't step in. This makes the regret part even stronger. \n\nIs there a strategy to come up with that makes it easier to step in?",
